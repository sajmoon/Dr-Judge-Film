It&#39;s to the credit of the amazing late filmmaker Kinji Fukasaku, that
even though the quality of the DVD I watched it on really sucked
butt-pucker, BATTLE ROYALE still turned to be one of the most
unsettling and riveting experiences I&#39;ve had watching any foreign film,
horror or otherwise. And that&#39;s even counting CITY OF GOD and PAN&#39;S
LABYRINTH!<br /><br />The bracing, shocking result of what you&#39;d get if you crossed a
Japanese version of BEVERLY HILLS 90210 with LORD OF THE FLIES and THE
RUNNING MAN, BATTLE is set in a bleak near-future Japan, where
unemployment is at an all-time high, and close to a million students
are running wild, boycotting classes and generally telling their elders
to &#39;piss off&#39;. In a jaw-dropping attempt to restore order, the
government has created the &quot;Battle Royale Act&quot;, passing it into law. <br /><br />This law calls for the random selection of 40 ninth-grade school
students who are drugged, whisked away to a deserted island off the
Japanese coast, then given an array of weapons with which they must
kill each other in order to survive. Every student is fitted with an
exploding neck bracelet that will detonate if they &quot;misbehave&quot; or
wander into any designated &quot;danger zones&quot; which will set them off.
After three days of carnage, if more than one student is left, the
collars will still be detonated, killing the remaining survivors, so
they have no choice but to fight to the death. <br /><br />You&#39;d think from the sound of it that this film is far too derivative
of other films to be good or even mildly interesting, but that&#39;s where
you&#39;d be wrong. As much as it&#39;s about bloodshed on a massive scale, BR
is also irresistible for two reasons: the featured cast is not made up
of twenty-somethings trying hard to pass for grade school students, but
are actors who actually are the ages of the characters they&#39;re
portraying.<br /><br />The other reason is because where other films of this kind might have
the students wiping each other out indiscriminately, here the
development of the characters has carefully been integrated into the
scenario. Realistically, everyone reacts to the situation in a
different manner, and most surprisingly of all, they do so in the same
way they would if they were still in school, more or less. Certain
cliques stick together, while others fall apart; some couples remain
together, even in death. Some unexpected alliances are formed, while
some classroom rivalries take on a deadly new dimension.<br /><br />Plus an emotional and heartbreaking layer is added; as each student
dies, either by suicide, accident or at the hand of someone who might
have even been a friend once upon a time, the BR number and name is
shown like a gruesome scorecard, along with a flashback of some event
in their lives that led them to their fates, whether what happened to
them was happy or not. Also shown is their epitaph, which usually fits
the person who said it.<br /><br />It&#39;s pretty long at just over two hours, but it moves with an amazing
speed, as you root for some characters and hope that others die first.
Front and center is the alliance/romance between Shuya Nanahara
(Tatsuya Fujiwara) and the girl he&#39;s had an unrequited crush on, Noriko
Nakagawa (Aki Maeda), who was also admired from afar by his best
friend. <br /><br />Unknown to anyone until it&#39;s far too late, a crazed &#39;ringer&#39;
contestant, Kazuo Kiriyama (Masanobu Ando in a chilling performance)
has been thrown into the mix - a kid who enjoys murder just for the
sheer pleasure of the kill. And the responsibility for putting this
maniac in the game falls squarely on the shoulders of the students&#39;
mostly unsympathetic teacher, played with gusto by top Japanese writer,
director and action star Takeshi &#39;Beat&#39; Kitano, (who starred in a hit
remake of ZATOICHI).<br /><br />Also worth noting is a striking turn by Chiaki Kuriyama as Takako
Chigusa, who treats the murderous contest like she would a school
election, mowing down the competition while barely ruffling a hair on
her pretty head. Is it any wonder that Quentin Tarantino selected her
to play Go-Go Yubari in KILL BILL? <br /><br />It&#39;s deeply affecting to see how these kids, who were wasting their
lives as rowdy delinquents, now won&#39;t even have the chance to turn
themselves around. Their lack of experiences are usually only revealed
at the moment of their deaths - boys and girls who never had their
first kiss, their first date or even the chance to tell someone how
they really felt about them...and now many of them never will.<br /><br />It isn&#39;t very often you get an emo-teen drama mixed in with what&#39;s very
nearly a pubescent snuff film, and the fact that it can mix the two
genres without missing a beat is amazing. All the while, the stunning
photography and the use of classical music in contrast to the
mind-bending violence gives it a very &quot;Kubrickian&quot; flavor, which is
probably just what director Fukasaku intended. <br /><br />Now I just need to get hold of a copy that had a more even sound mix
than this one had, (where the music nearly completely drowned out the
dialogue), and subtitles that led me to believe they were added in
Japan, since apparently the translator&#39;s second (or even third)
language wasn&#39;t English.<br /><br />Having said that, I strongly suggest that anyone who thinks they&#39;ve
seen the best sci- fi/horror/thrillers that Japan has to offer, needs
to check out BATTLE ROYALE, and I mean YESTERDAY!
