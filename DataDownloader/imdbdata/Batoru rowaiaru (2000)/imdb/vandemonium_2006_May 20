I found this movie well thought out and the cast was picked with
precision. The movie was acted with a tongue in cheek humour that
surprised me. Chiaki Kuriyama was for me the star of the movie and
literally stole the show in every scene she was in.<br /><br />The only problem with this movie was when it was released on a special
edition DVD. Now, I like Quentin Tarantino (for Jackie Brown &amp;
reservoir dogs) but I don&#39;t want him on a DVD that has nothing to do
with him telling me how a good a movie it is when I already like it.
It&#39;s like Lindsey Lohan telling me how good City of God is! I really
don&#39;t care what kind of views QT has. This was the only black spot on a
well packaged DVD. Other than this, it is a must buy for all genuine
movie fans. (great movies don&#39;t have to be in English and similarly,
non-English movies doesn&#39;t mean they are any good!)
