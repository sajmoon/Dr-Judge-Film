the real beauty of this film is that it has so many parallels with our
own personal experiences. Anyone who has suffered the loss of a loved
one could associate with &#39;shuya&#39; who loses both parents before having
to watch his best friend killed in front of him (in my opinion one of
the most nerve-racking and emotive scenes in the film). Any one who has
felt outcast from society at some point could empathise with Norioko
who was bullied and tormented at school by the very people now trying
to kill her.<br /><br />There are also very complex questions being asked and answered amongst
the supporting cast, how would you cope with being forced to murder
someone to survive? some noble characters commit suicide near the
start, others attempt to make peace or fight those in control. Yet some
characters use the island as an excuse to live out fantasies or exact
revenge, all the while the two main characters are going to desperate
lengths merely to stay alive. <br /><br />The similarities with &#39;lord of the flies&#39; should not be dismissed
lightly (written after the second world war, a group of stranded
children eventually form two rival communities, intended to suggest
that war was human nature), although in &#39;battle royal&#39; it is the adults
who have created an accelerated situation which forces the
confrontation. <br /><br />Beat Takeshi&#39;s character,from my perspective, portrays the sage-like
king of Japan (in his mind, maybe even god), sacrificing a few kids to
save the nation from chaos. An undertaking comparable to the sacrifice
of soldiers abroad to gain peace at home.<br /><br />I view Battle Royal as a metaphor for the sacrifice of a nations youth
in wartime, hence the military exercises Takeshi performs near the end.
