Brilliant film great twists and fabulous drama. Defanatly in my top
ten. My rating 10/10 100%. Also I'm a great fan of Chiaki Kuriyama (
Kill Bill and Battle Royal). Also some very funny scenes when people
get crap weapons and extrem Violante which I love. Some jumpy and loud
scenes of hales of bullets. Who is the ginger kid? Neva herd of him
before the film. Love the puzzling ending and weird beginning ewhen the
class are confused and teacher loves the advert. Thought the Island was
pretty cool and the hill scenes well coughed on camera no bad scenes or
random things that are nothing to do with the film. What a good name
battle Royal loved the title extremaly great film which appeals to
everyone hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Lloyd Howlett Age 13.
