This is the story of a Japan so out of control that in order to regain
control (I think) they stage a survival game that makes TV's Survivor look
like a walk in the park. One class of kids is dumped on an island and told
that the last one alive wins. <br /><br />This is a very very funny movie in a black comedy sort of way. Its very
violent and bloody and makes you wonder about why you're laughing since its
not all that far off from the way society operates, especially Japanese
society, where kids regularly kill themselves for not getting into the right
school.<br /><br />Its not for all tastes. Some people will find the idea offensive, a fact
that has kept the film from having an official US release. If you can take
your comedy black as night, then see this movie.<br /><br />8 out of 10<br /><br />
