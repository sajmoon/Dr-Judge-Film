quick plot summary: 40-ish Jr high school kids are put on an island...
the last one alive gets to leave the island. Lord of the Flies on
crack!<br /><br />Like many other movies based on books, this one falls short of the
emotional manipulation seen in the book. While the plot follows the
book quite closely, the especially gripping parts of the book are just
kind of laid out there without any back-story. While still gripping, it
could be so much more gripping if you knew of the years of anguish the
characters went through before tragedy struck. Still, it's a good movie
overall, with some brilliant juxtaposition of unimaginably picturesque
scenery with all that gruesome violence. It also does a Clockwork
Orange-like number with a lot of beautiful classical pieces that play
during the most gruesome scenes.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie. However, if you've read the book, you'll be
somewhat disappointed.
