It&#39;s like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. It was the first Japanese
movie i&#39;ve watched in many many years. And I do not regret. The Idea is
stunning. The locations are just beautiful. And the way things turned
out to be was a surprise to me. I sure hope that a BR law will stay in
the world of fiction. It would be sad, if there really was such a law.
True, the world is getting kinda crazy. But come on, there are some
limits, aren&#39;t they? Forcing children to kill each other?. Battle
Royale made me think, that although it is said that there&#39;s an animal
inside all of us, there are some people, who wouldn&#39;t find their animal
even in the situation where they had to kill in order to survive... And
that some people are just stupid...
