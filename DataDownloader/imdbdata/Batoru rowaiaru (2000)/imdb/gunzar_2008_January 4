There have been contrasting cries of &quot;greatest film ever made&quot; and
&quot;pointless gore fest&quot; made about BR, and neither are accurate in my
opinion. What it is, is a commentary about &quot;perceived&quot; (real or
otherwise) problems among Japanese teens in the late 90&#39;s.<br /><br />In one review, someone basically likened it to a movie involving young
Japanese girls running around in school uniforms acting violent....DUH,
thats the whole point. A lot of peoples only knowledge of Japan is
Manga and Hentai.<br /><br />If people bothered to watch the news once in awhile, they may know that
the establishment in Japan were VERY worried about young people getting
out of control, and BR portrays all this perfectly.<br /><br />Its NOT ultra violent, although the fact that they are supposed to be
teens makes it disturbing. Battle Royale is no worse than Lord of the
flies, but for some reason that has been deified as a work of art, and
BR is classed as trash. I&#39;d say its more about cultural snobbery than
actual appreciation of a truly magnificent film.
