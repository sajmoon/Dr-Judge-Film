2001_December 11 

I have to own up that I only viewed two films made by Beat Takeshi, Kikujiro
and Hana-bi (Fireworks as its English title), and I became a fan of his
cold, speechless films. I also had the chance to view Kinji Fukasaku's 1982
blockbuster (sorry I didn't know its English Title). I see many positive
reviews on this board and find many viewers bear positive attitudes toward
the way the old director pictures violence among teenage kids. As a
Taiwanese I have more chances than most IMDB users to see Japanese films as
well as animations. Our country is awash with Japanese pop idols and we have
three major cable channels dedicated to broadcasting Japanese TV shows. So
actually the &quot;excessive&quot; blood-shedding scenes in Battle Royale gave me no
surprise. That's the way many Japanese dramas, even TV shows, present
violent events. However the tension and cinematography are still capable of
shocking us. The gravity of this film also goes further than most Hollywood
flicks.<br /><br /> But from another point of view, this film is a cocktail which owes so many
to previous movies. The first of course is &quot;Lord of the Fly,&quot; which
constitutes the backbone of this film. &quot;Lord of the Fly&quot; has inspired a much
respected comic artist (sorry, don't know how to put his name in English) to
astound the Japanese readers with his masterpiece, the title may be
translated as &quot;The Abandoned Island.&quot; Maybe the director got more ideas from
this comic, which is common in Japanese showbiz. The explosive necklace
really reminds me of the 1991 &quot;Deadlock&quot; starring Rutger Hauer who plays a
prisoner escapes from a hi-tech prison which contains its inmates by
connecting two random prisoners through radio frequency emitted from the
sophisticated electronic necklace fixed to each person. In that film, any
criminal who tries to leave the prison will trigger the explosive on their
neck when he/she is away from the other inmate a defined distance. The final
showdown when the hero and his love shoot Takeshi only to find out he is
only holding a water pistol associates the final scene of &quot;Falling Down&quot;
starring Michael Douglas.<br /><br /> Despite all the heritage the director may inherit, the key tone in this
film is quite &quot;Japan.&quot; I don't know how many users are familiar with
Japanese comic books or animation, but awe to teenage power by the
collective adults seems to be typical of Japanese. In the milestone
animation &quot;Akira&quot; by Katsuhiro &Ocirc;tomo, I feel that adults, especially
middle-aged males, envy young adults' energy with a sense of fear. &quot;Akira&quot;
to me is a perfect example in which an ignored kid has the potential of
destroying the earth, while politicians can actually do little to contain
the impending  disaster.<br /><br /> In this film I find the director is quite ambivalent toward teenagers. Most
of them are appalling, while some still show a grain of good occasionally.
Therefore I think the director is too ambiguous about his attitude, and this
movie is too evasive. But some scenes will never escape from your mind, and
idea is really cool.
