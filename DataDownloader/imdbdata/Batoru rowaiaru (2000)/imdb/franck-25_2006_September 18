I think this is the strangest film I ever saw : I liked it so much and
it&#39;s difficult to describe why. Yet, I must pay deep respect to Kinji
Fukasaku for such a masterpiece.<br /><br />A masterpiece ? But this is all overacted ? Yes it&#39;s true ! The
photography is not really nice ? It&#39;s true ! The plot is somewhat
strange like the mobile phone scene in the end ! It&#39;s also true ! But
all these defects tend to create a mood going from very serious (the
movie can be very disturbing at times) to quite stupid (especially
those romance scenes) and it&#39;s the contrast between the two which is
the message of the movie.<br /><br />In fact, you have to read the novel to see how Fukasaku&#39;s made a marvel
here. If I had read the novel before, I wouldn&#39;t even have tried to
watch the movie. Because it seems impossible to adapt it to the cinema
without loosing it all. Yet Fukasaku&#39;s made it. And it really seems
that all the defects in this movie like the overacting and the stupid
romantic scenes are here to put the spectator in such a mood that he
will understand by himself what was the essence of the novel and what
seemed to be unexplainable with pictures rather than words.<br /><br />It&#39;s a movie about the transition from the innocence of childhood to
adulthood. You have to see the battle with all it&#39;s harshness as a
metaphor when young adults discover the bad sides of life. When you see
all the romance scenes, just remember when you were a teenager and try
to get in such a mood only to be disturbed by the next violent scene. A
few minutes after the fight officially begin, the movie will start to
capt all your attention. And sure, you&#39;ll remember when you were young
and start to identify with the characters.<br /><br />In the end, the movie has a hopeful message for all youth discovering
the world of today. It tells them not to refuse fight but to accept it.
But to still trust the selected few who will become your true friends.
And it tells you that those who do that will win instead of loosing.<br /><br />A definite must see.
