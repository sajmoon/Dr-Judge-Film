Cultural differences can be astounding. As with most first world
countries, the depiction of a child&#x27;s death is widely considered taboo
here in America. It&#x27;s interesting, then, that Kinji Fukasaku&#x27;s Battle
Royale is celebrated as a major achievement in Japanese cinema. After
all, it depicts dozens of teenagers brutally murdering one another. Not
only did the movie receive critical acclaim, but it also became one of
the 10 highest grossing films in Japan and went on to receive multiple
awards at the 2001 Japanese Academy Awards.<br /><br />Battle Royale is not without its controversies, however. Its native
Japan tried to ban Koushun Takami&#x27;s novel of the same name on which the
movie is based when it came out in 1999 and attempted to do the same to
the film upon its release the following year. Neither attempt was
successful, but other counties prevailed in blocking the release.
Thanks to the Streisand effect, all of the contention merely gave the
film free press.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, Battle Royale was never banned in the
United States. However, a distribution agreement had never been
reached. Various DVD incarnations of the film have been available in
the past, the legality of which is questionable at best. Anchor Bay&#x27;s
new version, therefore, marks the first official North American release
of the title.<br /><br />The release is well-timed. With the film adaptation of Suzanne Collins&#x27;
similarly themed The Hunger Games hitting theaters just a few days
later, the DVDs will be on new release endcaps while the subject matter
is fresh on everyone&#x27;s mind. And the comparison is not hidden; there is
a quote atop the back cover from Entertainment Weekly that equates the
two.<br /><br />Anchor Bay has provided viewers with a few options from which to chose.
First, there is a bare-bones DVD or Blu-ray with the film and nothing
else. More noteworthy, however, is the Battle Royale: The Complete
Collection four-disc set, which features both the theatrical and
extended cuts of the film, the 2003 sequel Battle Royale II and a disc
of bonus material.<br /><br />The film presented on the standalone disc is dubbed the director&#x27;s cut,
although that&#x27;s not exactly accurate. The extended cut features eight
additional minutes of footage, including three &#x22;requiems&#x22; at the end,
as well as various minor changes throughout the picture. Fukasaku
reportedly preferred the original cut, but the alterations don&#x27;t change
the overall narrative experience too much (although many fans will
argue this point).<br /><br />After experiencing the tragedies of September 11th and countless school
shootings in the years following the film&#x27;s release, Battle Royale is
less shocking for its depiction of kids being slaughter and more
terrifying that such heinous acts could actually be committed. The film
is not all melancholy, though; it is elegantly spun with dark humor and
great action. And it&#x27;s not just mindless violence for the sake of it;
the film is an allegory for the cutthroat world of adulthood that
awaits students after their schooling.<br /><br />In an alternate reality, the nation of Japan collapsed from
unemployment in the year 2000. Amidst the chaos, hundreds of thousands
of students boycotted school. As a result, the adults feared the youth
and, in an attempt to quell them, passed the Millennium Educational
Reform Act, also known as the Battle Royale Act.<br /><br />A class of 42 ninth graders who believe that they&#x27;re going on field
trip find themselves as the randomly chosen participants in the Battle
Royale. As their teacher, Kitano (Takeshi Kitano), explains, it is a
three-day battle to the death. Only the last student standing is
allowed to go home. Everyone is equipped with a bag of survival items,
including a random weapon - which can range from a submachine gun to a
saucepan lid.<br /><br />At first, the students think it&#x27;s a joke - but reality quickly sets in
when the first teen is killed without hesitation. From there, it
becomes and all-out war. One of the film&#x27;s strengths is that it
develops a large number of characters in a short amount of time. Given
that they are high school students, many of the plot points are based
on relationships and cliques. The viewer wants to see a number of them
succeed, but the rules clearly dictate that there can only be one
survivor.<br /><br />Battle Royale is a modern classic, not simply only for for the
controversy that it caused, but because it is a great film. It&#x27;s nice
to see that the artistic merit has superseded the reputation. If you
haven&#x27;t given in and purchased an imported copy already, the movie is a
must-own for any film fan.
