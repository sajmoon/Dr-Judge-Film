In the near future, high school students are protesting against the
school system as the adults begin to worry, thus creating a special
program called &quot;The Battle Royale Program&quot; in which students who are
selected at random must go on a island armed with weapons as they must
be separate to hunt and kill each other until one remains to become the
winner.<br /><br />One of the most controversial movies in recent memory is a wild and
ultra-violent Japanese Sci-fi action thriller inspired from a infamous
novel from it&#39;s native country has broke Japanese box-office records
and stirred up some trouble over there on the subject matter and on the
politics over there. The story is very intriguing with futuristic ideas
and some social issues thrown into it with graphic violence and gore
with it to keep the viewer entertained, the company who made this movie
called &quot;Toei Studios&quot; refuses to have this theatrically distributed in
the U.S. but is in many countries and the only way to view this movie
for U.S. viewers is to get a import DVD mainly a R0 one.<br /><br />The movie is a powerful, unique and disturbing epic beyond anything you
have seen before and is a must see movie.
