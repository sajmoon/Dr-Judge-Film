The first and only movie of insanity and chaos, with the love story to
support the characters. Who knows, if the us replicates this movie
exactly then it may possibly be even better as far as cinematography.
even though it looked like a low budget stereotypical monster flick,
the story plot was more than enough to make this movie amazing. If us
gets a hold of this movie and simply reshoots the entire film then yes
it will be awesome, but if someone like Lions Gate films comes out with
this than it will be horrible in every single way. All that&#39;s left to
do is hope...\<br /><br />-Jamie
