Gods, 7.8 rating score for this movie?<br /><br />You all are deceived by the stereotypic japanese style - pretending
something important here.<br /><br />1. The starting concept is a bit bold, but not that new if you've read any
jap ani or manga.<br /><br />2. The gore scenes are not impressive but hilarious sometimes with some
awful writings and actings.<br /><br />3. Some important meaning hidden behind gores? No. Absolutely not.
Actually,
by pretending as if there were some important meaning behind, it is
masking
your conscience so letting the director nor watchers not feeling guilt for
such meaningless killing spree.<br /><br />Conclusion: This movie is just for fun. That's all. And it's a bit wicked
and shameless in the meaning that it's pretending as a serious movie and
hiding its true intent. Don't let this movie ridicule you.<br /><br />But still, i must admit it's not a boring movie.<br /><br />My Rating: 6/10
