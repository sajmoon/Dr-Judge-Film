I had only heard about this movie after hearing that Quentin Tarantino
loved it, and cast Chiaki Kuriyama in her role as Gogo in Kill Bill
Volume 1. So of course, I was expecting some horrific violence that
most likely was going to be torturous to watch, especially since
Japanese films know how to handle this subject matter with horrific
realism.<br /><br />The story is simply this: a bunch of school students who have finished
their compulsory education are taken on a bus to a field trip, only to
be kidnapped, gassed and have these collars put on them. They awaken to
find that they have been selected to participate in a game that is
backed by the government. The objective: they have three days to battle
against one another: there must be one survivor, and if there isn&#x27;t a
clear winner, all of them will die. Hence, this keeps the motivation to
destroy each other one by one.<br /><br />However, I was very surprised when I watched this movie. Sure, it was
violent, but not to the extent where it was horrific. What really
surprised me most was that I actually cared about these characters.
What I was expecting was senseless violence, but the characters are
human. You see the struggle they go through to stay together, to not
become murderers and also they discover more about themselves along the
way. IT also explores what people will become when faced in a life or
death situation, and also how some will fight the whole way not to
become something that others can so easily become.<br /><br />Yes, I was surprised at how much I cared about the characters. While a
lot of them get the &#x27;game over&#x27; fairly soon, it is this sense of being
trapped and not knowing what to do that creates the whole terror of
being stuck in a hopeless situation. The characters are also likable
and it is interesting to see how a lot of them learn things quickly and
how to adapt, but also on how they form bonds, squabble over little
quarrels such as boyfriends and school crushes, and how a lot of them
simply want that sense of being loved in what could be their last
moments alive.<br /><br />And it really wasn&#x27;t that violent in my opinion. I think the reason it
got an R rating in Australia, is due to the fact that it promotes
violence as a game. I didn&#x27;t particularly find the violence gruesome
that I had to turn my eyes away from the screen, but I see that it is
definitely a film that shows that violence can be apart of any human
being - it only whether we choose to act on it, or are forced to that
it becomes a tool we use.<br /><br />I am still astonished that I really got into this movie, considering
that I thought this was going to be disturbing and gruesome, and I got
something a bit more meaningful instead.
