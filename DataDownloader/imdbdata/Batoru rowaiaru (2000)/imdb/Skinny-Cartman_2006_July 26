What can I say? This is the best movie ever made. I can&#39;t even begin to
describe how good this movie is. The plot is al ready on IMDb so i&#39;ll
skip that, and i&#39;ll just say this was the best movie i&#39;ve ever seen.
Watch it, its incredible! 10 out of 10<br /><br />Never before have I seen a movie where 9th graders kill each other and
die. It was like an seeing Star Wars for the first time back in the
70s. Hopefully, this movie will open a brand new era in horror. I&#39;m so
sic of 20-something-year-olds playing high school kids getting killed
off by in-breeds. This movie is fresh, original, and like nothing I&#39;ve
ever seen. I&#39;m gunna go watch it again now.....
