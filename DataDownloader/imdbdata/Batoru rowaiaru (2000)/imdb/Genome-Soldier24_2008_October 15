The author of this film&#39;s review giving it a ten out of ten stating
that the original author of the original book directed the film
adaptation is completely ridiculous. The book is a lot better than the
film is, and the film loses a lot of the book&#39;s inner messages, which
was what kept it from being a meaningless bloodbath. The movie&#39;s pretty
bare though, and this is coming from a person who has read both the
entire manga series, the book, and has seen the film. I can tell you
that the film is the worst of the three. The manga is the best, and if
there were a manga series done with care it&#39;d probably be really good
too.
