2007_September 8 
Easily the worst film I&#39;ve seen this year, possibly the worst film of
all time. A Japanese twist on American reality shows, only with lots of
blood. It has a high school mentality that just drags the film down to
a juvenile level. One dying teenager says to another, &quot;you look cool&quot;,
the other dying teenager replies, &quot;you are the coolest girl in the
world.&quot; And so it continues...teens admitting hidden crushes and
unrequited loves, then dying violently. I found myself laughing
hysterically at times that were probably intended to be profound and
moving. I thought maybe the director was being satirical and the whole
thing was a spoof...but I think not. The ending with Kitano was
ridiculous. Finally, the multiple &quot;requiems&quot; at the end was just
melodrama at its absolute worst. I&#39;m sure easily manipulated teens will
be crying, but savvy viewers will be laughing at the ludicrousness of
it all.
