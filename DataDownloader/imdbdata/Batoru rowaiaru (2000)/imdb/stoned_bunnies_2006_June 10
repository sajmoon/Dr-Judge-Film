Based on a Japanese novel by Koushun Takami, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is the
story of a group of ninth graders who are transported to a small
isolated island with a map, food and different arms. They are told to
fight each other for three consecutive days until there remains but one
student, who will then be named the &#39;winner&#39;. All students are forced
to wear a metal collar with a radar so that their teacher is aware when
a rule is being broken.<br /><br />The film is set in Japan and is in Japanese (and if you do come across
a dubbed version, dispose of it immediately because it&#39;s only worth it
to watch the original). It&#39;s hard to classify this film, as despite the
extreme violence in it, it isn&#39;t action and despite its nightmarish
feel, it isn&#39;t horror. It&#39;s just in between. There are many themes to
this story; from to trust to complete selfishness (killing your best
friend to save your own life) to suicide to disloyalty, and the list
goes on.<br /><br />The actors in Battle Royale were amazing. It is rare to find young
talents like these, for instance, in Hollywood. These actors were by
far the best young actors I have seen in all my life (though most of
them weren&#39;t as young as their characters were). Tatsuya Fujiwara plays
the main character, Shuya, a young man who is struck by tragedy when he
becomes an orphan. All he has now is his best friend and the girl with
whom he is madly in love. Fujiwara did a great job of transmitting the
feel of despair that one would probably feel if he/she were to see his
best friend die before their eyes, or to have to see classmates killing
each other and then to portray that never-ending trust that two lovers
share. The other actors all did a generally good job as well.<br /><br />The first actor I&#39;d like to criticize is Taro Yamamoto, who played the
compassionate Shougo Kawada, who helps the protagonist and his
girlfriend as the game of Battle Royale goes on. I thought that
Yamamoto overplayed the character&#39;s casualty and I didn&#39;t feel as
attached to him watching the movie as I did reading the comic book. The
other actor I thought did a terrible job relative to the other actors
was Masanobu Ando, who played the haunting character Kazuo Kiriyama,
who basically seemed immune to everything. While reading the book, that
guy really creeped the sh*t out of me. But in the movie, he just
basically did the &quot;undercover&quot; thing and sort of leaped from place to
place and tortured and killed people and that was it. You didn&#39;t feel
anything, and in my opinion, that character was one of the most
important so it was pretty disappointing. But putting those two aside,
the acting WAS splendid, just as the directing of (sci-fi/Japanese
gangster movie director) Kinji Fukasaku was.<br /><br />I thought that the story was very haunting and compelling, and that you
should read the novel or the comic book before watching the movie
because just the use of your imagination and attachment to the
characters while reading the books is so much more real. I really
enjoyed the movie too, though, and would recommend it to anyone who has
the stomach for constant shootings, hangings, blowing-up, abandoned
corpses and a lot of blood squirting everywhere.<br /><br />And so if it fits the shoe, rent it out. You probably won&#39;t regret it.
