I had the option to watch this movie for a class, and since I'm a
Japanese major, I thought I should see it. It is amazing. If you don't
like blood and gore, it might not be for you, but even so, it's a great
film that is also a beautiful social commentary on what it means to be
an adult, to be a child, and to trust other people.<br /><br />Although, if you are into watching people get hacked apart and dying
other various fun ways, you can just ignore all that stuff... But then
you'll miss most of the point, and probably only think the movie is
so-so. The blood doesn't look THAT real.<br /><br />Enjoy!
