Most of the reviewers here speak from their own viewpoints, i.e.
non-Japanese westerners, and they praise/knock the movie based on its
violence, plot, etc. That's fine. But through their ignorance of the culture
this film springs from, they are missing its subtleties.<br /><br />I've been teaching in a Japanese high school for three years now. Once I saw
this movie, I could instantly appreciate its skill and surprising frankness
at commenting on some of the sad and strange realities of Japan's modern
youth.<br /><br />Japan is a culture obsessed with youth. Almost everything here is tailored
to the under-30 (and much younger, actually) crowd. For example, most
westerners watching Japanese TV will be surprised at how childish it seems.
The things that seem childish to your average American junior-high student
are very appealing for a Japanese high-school student. Girls in their 30s
desperately try to be &quot;cute&quot; to attract guys. Adults and children alike read
comics by the droves, and sometimes pops up a strange, not-too-well-hidden
undercurrent of pedophilia.<br /><br />This movie takes the heavily cliquish, often childish, and often
incomprehensible (to me) social system of young Japanese boys and girls and
gives them guns. This is the natural result. Take it from me, the characters
and situations are very realistic. <br /><br />This gets mixed with the growing anxiety among the older generation at the
rising rudeness and rebellion of the new generation in a culture that values
politeness above all else. From a frustrated and humiliated teacher; to
students killing each other over seemingly unimportant squabbles; to the
overly-cutesy, peppy training video that perfectly mimics nearly any show on
NHK these days -- this film subtly and brilliantly comments on half-a-dozen
issues that weigh heavily on the minds of Japanese people today. That's why
it was such a big hit in Japan.<br /><br />Maybe you just have to live here to get it. I give it 5
stars.
