This film carries one of the most extreme taglines I have ever heard
of: &quot;Could you kill your best friend?&quot; This poses an extremely
confronting and daunting question for many, including myself. I
personally could never, ever do such a thing, but are do my friends
feel that way?? That&#39;s one of the many themes and situations that are
brought up in this outstanding Japanese horror/black comedy. Kinji
Fukasaku has made one of the best films of the 21st century. This movie
is easily one of, if not THE most, daunting, confronting, disturbing
and controversial movies made.<br /><br />The Japanese society is becoming increasingly violent. Students are
dropping out of school and becoming criminals. To put a stop to this,
the government put a new Act into place, the Battle Royale Act. A Year
9 class are selected to participate. Basically, these bunch of students
are pitted against each other in a battle to death. They have three
days to kill each other, the last person standing gets to leave the
island alive.<br /><br />This, for me, is a very uncomfortable movie to watch because of the
subject matter. To think that these 9th graders are actually put
through this hell is quite horrific. It makes the movie that much more
involving. The violence is harsh and in your face. It&#39;s rough to watch,
but dealt with professionally so it isn&#39;t a joke. It&#39;s all the more
disturbing because the characters are so likable and well-written that
we don&#39;t want them to die (well, most anyway). Some of the deaths are
quite tragic. The actors really put all their efforts into their roles
to make them that much more interesting.<br /><br />Many will think this is straight out horror, but there are definitely
some comic elements to it that are really quite funny. That may seem
disgusting but it is relevant to the message the director is making.
How does the government solve violence.....with more violence. (That&#39;s
not the message, but I think it&#39;s a great thing the movie has going for
it).<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone except people with weak stomachs or
someone who hates horror/black comedy movies.<br /><br />4/5.
