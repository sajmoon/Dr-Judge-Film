Not only are comic book characters finding screen time in the cinemas,
but fairy tale ones as well, with films such as Red Riding Hood going
through a reinvention of the character, as does Snow White this year
with no less than two big budgeted productions, each with its unique
take on the character in what would be a face off between Lily Collins
and Kristen Stewart in the title roles, one still very much that demure
teenager, while the other going by the trailers happen to be more
warrior princess instead.<br /><br />The Snow White I believe most of us know is likely the Walt Disney
version, her trademark being that of her songs, dance, and ability to
uncannily communicate with birds and other small, cute animals.
Tarsem&#x27;s Snow White does the same too, well almost, albeit influenced
in more Bollywood terms with the supporting dancers, their twirls,
colours and costumes on display (designed by the late Eiko Ishioka),
and she&#x27;s basically is on a mission to rediscover her kingdom&#x27;s
penchant for celebration all over again given the void after the
disappearance of her father the King (Sean Bean). After all, Lily
Collins shows she&#x27;s up to the mark and a bona fide Disney-ish version
with the provision of her singing voice in I Believe (In Love) in a
sequence that could be liken to be as out of place as Jai Ho in Danny
Boyle&#x27;s Slumdog Millionaire.<br /><br />But while her Snow White is that demure damsel who&#x27;s the fairest of
them all, she also does show a little bit more character in her ability
and grit determination to wield a weapon to wage war against her
enemies, namely her stepmother The Evil Queen (Julia Roberts) and her
minions, made up of court bootlicker Brighton (Nathan Lane) and other
mystical creatures, including her own magic mirror reflection in a
stunning CG sequence each time she calls out to her. But don&#x27;t expect a
full on battle ala the other Snow White played by Kristen Stewart, as
this one gets trained by her seven thieving dwarfs who decide that she
joins them in their mission if she wants to continue seeking refuge in
their humble abode, and passes with having looks, brains and brawn,
with plenty of heart going out to her people when she learns of the
truth of the suffering in the villages.<br /><br />Visionary director Tarsem Singh is well know for the imagery of his
films, full of the fantastical, strange, but always fascinating view of
the created world. While his previous film Immortals may have suffered
by the lack of a strong plot and action that made it look like a poor
cousin to 300, he&#x27;s back in his element with Mirror Mirror, providing
the audience a visual treat while treading on a story structure that is
familiar with most, which more or less follows the line of the evil
Queen being jealous of Snow White&#x27;s beauty and gets rid of her, only to
have the planned assassination attempt botched with the killer taking
pity, her venturing into the woods and meeting up with the seven
dwarfs, with the Queen poisoning her with an apple, and to be rescued
by Prince Charming, or in this case, a certain Prince Alcott (Armie
Hammer) from Valencia.<br /><br />But be warned that this version too may not go down well with some,
especially since the story by Melisa Wallack reworks most of the major
details on how the Prince meets up with Snow White, playing a major
role here rather than appearing as a cameo at the end, and giving each
of the seven dwarfs completely different personalities, with names like
Napoleon (Jordan Prentice), Half Pint (Mark Povinelli), Grub (Joe
Gnoffo), Wolf (Sebastian Saraceno), Grimm (Danny Woodburn), Butcher
(Martin Klebba) and Chuckles (Ronald Lee Clark), who are almost
Robin-Hood like in a subplot about not being loved, and discriminated
against. But thankfully some of their personalities come across with
good natured humour.<br /><br />Much has been said of Julia Robert&#x27;s role as the sarcastic Queen whose
heart is filled with plenty of black humour, and her character is quite
man-crazy, finding it necessary to quickly hook up a rich prince/king
in order to continue with her lavish lifestyle at the expense of the
kingdom&#x27;s coffers, raising taxes to fund her whims and fancies.
Probably the first Snow White story to have both the Queen and Snow
White tussle for the love of the Prince, all I can say is Armie Hammer,
who did a great job as the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network and
as J.Edgar&#x27;s right hand man, continues to impress in his roles - in
this one having a shirtless running joke - that I am anticipating his
turn as The Lone Ranger come next year. Lily Collins will have you
believe she IS Snow White, and carries what is expectant of the fairest
of them all pretty well, and doesn&#x27;t make you wonder why so many become
mesmerized by her beauty. But flower vase she is not, as she has two
missions to fulfill, one to bring back laughter to her kingdom, and to
track down the whereabouts of her father.<br /><br />Mirror Mirror has plenty of tongue in cheek jokes, and slapstick
scenario at times, that puts it close to being an outright comedy, yet
not quite. Instead it&#x27;s as close to what a fairy tale will look like on
the big screen with the plenty of beautiful sets and scenarios crafted
for the characters to operate in that made it quite dream like, and
Tarsem being at his element in crafting a visually impressive outing
that draws first blood in rival Snow White films. The I Believe (In
Love) segment has already earned brownie points from me, so let&#x27;s see
what the other Snow White film can come up with something unique.
