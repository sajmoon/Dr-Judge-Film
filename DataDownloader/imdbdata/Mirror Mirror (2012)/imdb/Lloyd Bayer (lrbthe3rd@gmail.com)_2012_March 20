I can only think of one other movie where Julia Roberts is cast in a
negative role. When news broke out that Roberts will play the evil
queen in this Grimm&#x27;s fairy tale adaptation, I just couldn&#x27;t resist.
Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s not everyday you get to see the most popular
actress in the world (with the best smile in Hollywood) play an evil
and conniving character. In this version, the story remains true to
original, if not with a wacky twist and a lot of humor. <br /><br />After the king disappears under mysterious circumstances, Snow White
(Lily Collins) learns that her step-mother the queen (Roberts) has been
plundering and looting from the people of the land. After rescuing a
prince (Armie Hammer)from seven &#x27;little&#x27; highway bandits, and gaining
his affection, Snow White is banished to the forest when the queen sees
wealth and power in the guise of the unwitting prince; besides his use
as her toy-boy. Snow White must now team up with the aforementioned
bandits and win back her birthright, her prince, and restore her
father&#x27;s kingdom to its former glory. Thus begins an itchy cat-fight
with a capital B. <br /><br />Having just watched this movie, I can&#x27;t say that this is the best
adaptation thus far, given its PG classification. However, considering
that there are two other versions slated for a 2012 release, including
a darker version starring the emotionless Kristen Stewart, I am forced
to say that &#x22;Mirror Mirror&#x22; suffices as a decent family
adventure-comedy. Having cut a niche for himself in visual esthetics
and art design, director Tarsem Singh creates a vivid and colorful
world with innovative sets and costumes &#x96; a standard that is rapidly
becoming his cinematic insignia after his work from &#x22;The Cell&#x22; to last
year&#x27;s &#x22;Immortals&#x22;. Singh also scores with intended comic relief, given
that he has had to work with a story where the audience knows what to
expect. When you consider the story&#x27;s comic backbone complete with
slapstick moments, Roberts&#x27;s sarcastic one-liners arising from a witty
script and the ever amusing Nathan Lane as the queen&#x27;s royal subject,
this movie becomes a lighthearted stab at one of the oldest and most
adapted fairy tales. That said, this version sits well with the
intended audience in its narration, if you go in expecting a simple and
entertaining movie. <br /><br />I really can&#x27;t say that I was captivated by the acting. Collins as Snow
White and Hammer as the prince are just so-so as protagonists of an age
old tale. Given the age of &#x27;girl power&#x27;, it is no surprise that Snow
White here is a spirited young girl that not even for a moment, appears
to be a damsel in distress. On the other hand, the prince is comical in
almost all scenes, stripping (pun unintended) his character of any
chivalry from the original tale. As the movie is narrated in the
queen&#x27;s perspective, it becomes apparent that the story is less about
Snow White and more about the queen and her vanity. This chain of
thought is what gives &#x22;Mirror Mirror&#x22; a new spin to the old yarn.
Personally, I strongly feel that Julia Roberts steals the show &#x96; not
because I expected her to &#x96; but simply because the story appears to
have been scripted with a lot of focus on her character. It&#x27;s almost as
if this version was written by the evil queen herself. <br /><br />For the most part, Singh&#x27;s work here is a tad bit above average in
re-telling a grand old tale. He keeps it simple while giving it a fresh
and anti-Disney twist. Then he goes and ruins it with a totally
unnecessary and bizarre Bollywood ending. I mean, seriously? If Singh
has used this movie to say something about his roots, then he has
picked the wrong movie to do so. Mixing Hollywood and Bollywood themes
within the same movie is always risky. Danny Boyle may have gotten away
with it in &#x22;Slumdog Millionaire&#x22; because of its theme on poverty and
the hugely popular underdog factor. All said and done, if it were not
for Snow White doing the &#x22;Bhangra&#x22;, I would have easily rated this film
as a good start to 2012. Even so, if you are willing to overcome your
disbelief in the end, the greater part of this movie is not half as
bad.
