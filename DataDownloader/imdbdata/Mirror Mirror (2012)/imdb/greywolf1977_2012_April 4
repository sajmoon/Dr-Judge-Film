Had a day off and decided &#x22;What the heck... I will go see Mirror,
Mirror.&#x22; The movie is moderately entertaining. Plot devices are
everywhere! I agree with those who call the prince &#x22;flat&#x22; and heartily
agree that it is far from intellectually stimulating.<br /><br />There are a few great lines, and a few glimpses of depth in characters
proving this could have been a much better movie. Near the end in an
exchange between Snow and the old beggar lady (yes, it&#x27;s the queen)is
an example of both.<br /><br />There are many beautiful shots in the movie and the costumes are lovely
but few. There aren&#x27;t many costume changes leaving one to assume
everything takes place in about a week&#x27;s time.<br /><br />I give the film a 6/10 due to the fact that it is suitable for younger
audiences (having no vulgarity, no sexual scenes and no gore). The
story is weak, twists take you to obvious places.<br /><br />This movie is good for a leisurely outing, just don&#x27;t expect too much.
It&#x27;s good for a one time viewing.
