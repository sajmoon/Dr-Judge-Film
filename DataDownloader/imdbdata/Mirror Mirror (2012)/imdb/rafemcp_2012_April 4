I really wanted to like this movie but it wouldn&#x27;t let me.<br /><br />Julia gives great off-hand evil and Arnie Hammer is as handsome and
princely as one could wish. The costumes are clever and outrageous and
some of the conceits, like the magic mirror are ingenious but there&#x27;s
too much time spent subverting the Disney version and winking at the
audience&#x97; cute Dwarf names etc. If they&#x27;d gone back to the Grimm
original and built the story anew, they might have come up with
something surprising and fresh. I love fantasy and had high hopes for
this movie but with the number of big budget fantasy films tanking
these days&#x97;&#x22;John Carter&#x22; anyone? (which I thought was great) I fear the
fantasy film will soon be dead in the water. If &#x22;Snow White and the
Huntsman&#x22; bombs, we can say goodbye to this genre. If only Julia and
her stupendously absurd dresses were in another, better movie, one that
had gone through several more re-writes and directed by someone with a
strong narrative sense, then we might have had something. As for the
Bollywood number, make it relevant or don&#x27;t do it.<br /><br />In the words of John Lennon: &#x22;Snow What and the Seven Dwarts&#x22;. Now,
that would have been a good movie which &#x22;Mirror Mirror&#x22; ain&#x27;t, alas.
