I adored this movie. The queen was adorable, &#x26; very tongue in cheek.
When Prince boy comes in half naked (which he managed several times) -
the queen is so funny as she mutters,&#x27;smooth &#x26; hairy&#x27;. There is a
definite sound of her purring. Her evilness is quite delightful.<br /><br />I want to go live in the forest with the dwarfs and learn to fight &#x26; be
a thief. There was a bit of peter pan and the lost boys in there. It
took enough time to get to know the dwarfs &#x26; their little quirks.<br /><br />The butler (or whatever he was) was great. I found it a very feel good
movie. They had the whole winter thing when the queen was in charge -
shades of Narnia. It kept my interest all the way through, didn&#x27;t drag.
I was smiling thru most of the movie. Excellent use of CGI - beautiful
scenery and magical castle scenes. Amazing architecture and costumes.
It had a pantomime feel. In the end it goes full colour as there&#x27;s a
thaw, great song and all boogie on down. I may go and see it again.<br /><br />Snow white was great too. She was an intelligent young woman with a bit
of feist about her.
