Following the example of Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Red Riding Hood
(2011), the film Mirror Mirror takes the most basic concepts of a
famous fairy tale as a starting point, and it disfigures it until
leading to an unrecognizable modern and revisionist version whose
purpose, moral or function I don&#x27;t reach to comprehend. Nevertheless,
I&#x27;m not against the procedure...after all, this fairy tales have been
suffering uncountable variations since its beginnings in the European
folklore, and it isn&#x27;t wrong to impulse its evolution for the
consumption of modern sensibilities. The problem comes when the effort
invested on the re-imagination isn&#x27;t enough for making an entertaining
movie, and that&#x27;s a clear example of what happened to Mirror Mirror.<br /><br />The changes made by Mirror Mirror are the following: the conflict
between Snow White and her step-mom isn&#x27;t because of beauty, but
because of political ideology; the &#x22;dwarves&#x22; aren&#x27;t miners, but
highwaymen; the Prince is profiling from the beginning as a reluctant
fianc&#xE9; of the Queen; and the mirror isn&#x27;t a mirror, but some kind of
portal to a parallel world (I suppose so?) in which the Queen saves her
conscience (or something like that?). In fact, the story is so
different that I expected a pitched battle in the ending, like it had
happened in Alice in Wonderland (2010). However, instead of that,
there&#x27;s a fight against a monster (?). Well, to be exact, there&#x27;s
another ending, which I won&#x27;t describe, but I will say that it&#x27;s so bad
that I wanted to take my eyes off while I was watching it.<br /><br />The production design from Mirror Mirror is extremely opulent and
elaborate, and it can be noticed a fetish for the golden colors, the
over-designed dresses and such extreme disguises which would be even
rejected by singer Bj&#xF6;rk. Anyway, the point is that there are some
attractive images in Mirror Mirror, but that isn&#x27;t enough to rescue the
movie from being tedious. Julia Roberts brings an extremely forced
performance as the Queen, while Lily Collins feels insipid as Snow
White. Armie Hammer brings some enthusiasm to his role, but his
character is so poorly written that he&#x27;s not given too much to do.<br /><br />In conclusion, Mirror Mirror is a boring film with a badly raised and
executed idea. As a consequence, I can&#x27;t recommend it. I just hope that
the film Snow White and the Huntsman, another re-invention of the same
fairytale we will see in a few months, will be better than this one.
