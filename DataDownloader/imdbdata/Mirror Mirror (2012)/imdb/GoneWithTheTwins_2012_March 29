&#x22;A little too much&#x22; sums up the entirety of Tarsem Singh&#x27;s whimsical
fairy tale Mirror Mirror. From the lavish costume designs and bizarre
CG creations to the over-the-top acting and points of monumental
silliness, the latest reimagining of the Snow White fable confronts its
zenith in every facet and intrepidly breaches it. The film&#x27;s inability
to show restraint in its slapstick visuals and madcap gags causes a
predictable repetition of puerility. When the quirky fun stays in
check, Mirror Mirror reveals many of the engaging elements of the
original legend as well as a spirited humor that should appeal to many.
The triumph will be if it can outweigh the numerous moments of
excessive idiocy.<br /><br />In a magical kingdom, an evil Queen (Julia Roberts) is left to rule
when a terrible beast kills the King (Sean Bean). On her eighteenth
birthday, the King&#x27;s beautiful daughter, Snow White (Lily Collins),
finally ventures forth from her castle prison to discover the ruin the
Queen&#x27;s unrelenting greed has caused upon the commoners. Appalled by
what she finds, Snow White confronts the tyrant only to be sentenced to
death. When the Queen&#x27;s aide (Nathan Lane) is unable to do the deed,
the young girl escapes into the woods where she encounters seven brave
dwarfs and a noble prince (Armie Hammer) who may be her only hope in
overthrowing the wicked ruler.<br /><br />Mirror Mirror possesses just as many verbal annoyances, inattention to
storytelling structure, and inconsistency with tone as 2010&#x27;s Alice in
Wonderland. What it does better, however, is to present purposeful
costumes. The costume designs are by far the strongest visual
constituent, demonstrating Tarsem&#x27;s signature flair for fantastical
garments, as well as a particularly adept comedic component not found
frequently enough in such family-friendly fare. A masquerade ball
sequence is the highlight of the apparel, showcasing hilarious
interpretations of assorted animals. It&#x27;s a shame the rest of the humor
couldn&#x27;t keep up with the eye-catching attire - or Lily Collins&#x27;
intrusively prominent eyebrows. The CG also bears Tarsem&#x27;s typical
look, which is unfortunately a noticeably lower quality than what is to
be expected from a bigger budget Hollywood film, and yet another aspect
not up to par with the wardrobe.<br /><br />While the dialogue mixes in pop culture, anachronistic sayings, and
juvenile yet harmless insinuations, the laughs aren&#x27;t sizeable enough
or undeviating enough to be effective. Julia Roberts has a few decent
lines, but is written to be so dreadfully irritating at the start that
it&#x27;s difficult to welcome the role. Nathan Lane&#x27;s performance is much
more satisfying, and yet he portrays a character akin to all of his
recent turns. With a touch of mild cleverness along the lines of The
Princess Bride, or watching imagery unfold as a fairy tale is read to a
child, Mirror Mirror is much more palatable than the trailers would
have audiences believe. As if to shatter the hard-earned complacency of
viewers warming up to this off-the-wall retelling of a tired story,
Tarsem has the nerve to conclude his work with a grating, ear-piercing,
highly contrasting Bollywood song-and-dance segment that very
upsettingly leaves a sour taste to the whole affair. What a terrible
way to end a dangerously mediocre film. Why would distributor
Relativity Media allow this to happen? - The Massie Twins
