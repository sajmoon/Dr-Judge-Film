STORY: Mirror Mirror follows the classic tale of the Evil Queen (Julia
Roberts) rules over the kingdom of a princess known as Snow White (Lily
Collins). Snow White enlists the help of seven dwarfs to win back her
birthright and her Prince Charming (Armie Hammer).<br /><br />THE ACTING: Lily Collins did a pretty good job playing the beautiful
and innocent Snow White. Julia Roberts was quite solid playing the
Queen. Armie Hammer &#x96; who did a great job playing both Tyler and
Cameron Winklevoss from The Social Network &#x96; didn&#x27;t do all that great
playing the prince. Nathan Lane did a decent job playing Brighton, the
Queen&#x27;s servant.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS: Snow White is one of the most, if not, &#x22;the&#x22; most famous
fairy tale ever told. But when I saw the trailer for Mirror, Mirror, I
was bit too underwhelmed from some of the footage that was in it.
Despite the fact it did look stunning in its visuals, I thought Mirror,
Mirror looked a bit too cheesy and childish for my taste. Although it
did star some really good actors and actresses, but the movie didn&#x27;t
look very good at all.<br /><br />I went into the movie and came out what I expected. A movie that I
think kids will love, but probably not for some teenagers and adults.
I&#x27;m not saying Mirror, Mirror was terrible. I would say it was a bit
average.<br /><br />Director Tarsem Singh has an excellent visual style and I absolutely
loved how he made Mirror, Mirror look beautiful, but I thought the
story to it wasn&#x27;t really all that strong. I know the story behind it
is supposed to be kid-friendly, but I found it to be a bit cheesy, to
say the least.<br /><br />The fight scenes were a bit tedious. Only a few special effects were a
bit cartoonish. Some of the scenes that are supposed to be funny were
rather childish.<br /><br />IN CONCLUSION: Although Mirror Mirror is as harmless and non-offensive
as some other family movies can be, the movie itself was an average
adaptation to one of the beloved fairy tales of all-time. The look of
the film and the acting were both top-notch, but it was just childish
and cheesy. I won&#x27;t necessarily recommend it if you go see this movie,
but I highly recommend if you wait for Snow White and the Huntsman to
come out.<br /><br />2/4
