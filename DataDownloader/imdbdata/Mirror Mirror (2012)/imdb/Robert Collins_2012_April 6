In my opinion this movie is just lacking something, obviously it&#x27;s a
comedy, which I thought was aimed equally at adults and children alike,
I mean it has Julia Roberts in it, but I think this film is strictly
for kids only. From the trailer I thought it was going to be a rather
tongue in cheek retelling of the long tried and tested story of Snow
White, but pretty much instantly I realized that I was wrong. I think
with a story so well known and loved as Snow White is hard to retelling
in a different way without ruining it, every single joke was very very
juvenile, the kids in the theater were having a swell time, but most of
the parents were just grinning and bearing it.<br /><br />The casting is atrocious, I think the actual cast are all obviously
talented but they are so miscast, the only person who somewhat seems at
home in the role is Lily Collins, she&#x27;s OK as Snow White but I just
don&#x27;t think she is Snow White, however she does look absolutely
gorgeous in the film, Julia Roberts is nowhere near evil enough and
Armie Hammer is kind of unnecessary.<br /><br />I think the reason Julia Roberts doesn&#x27;t seem evil enough is that the
script is comedic, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one but I don&#x27;t think
Julia is that funny, extremely miscast.<br /><br />The movie isn&#x27;t all bad, obviously the costuming and the production is
top notch, the dresses and sets are fantastic and a feast for the eyes
and the supporting cast deliver fun performances, in particular Nathan
Lane and the 7 Dwarfs. All in all it was a bit of a disappointment,
when you mess with classic stories too much it&#x27;s always risky and this
has been messed with and changed far too much. Like I said, great for
kids.
