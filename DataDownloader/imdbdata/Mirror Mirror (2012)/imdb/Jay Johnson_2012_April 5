Mirror mirror on the wall what is the most mediocre film of the year?
Well this is definitely a contender, the well known story of Snow White
is &#x22;turned on its head&#x22; and given a modern twist. But this modern twist
is neither particularly well established, nor well written. The best
thing in Mirror Mirror is the set pieces and costume design, the film
looks lush and colourful and very &#x22;fairytale&#x22;. Where the film doesn&#x27;t
quite hold up is in its execution of the idea, yes they are putting
modern characters in non-modern setting which is pleasant, but they
really could have ran with this idea more. The romantic entanglements
in the film are no different from all others that have been present in
all other romantic comedies, this film could have been so different but
it falls into predictable which is both wincing and clich&#xE9;.<br /><br />This aside the film is enjoyable, but would have benefited from having
Julia Roberts Evil Queen being featured even more. As the Evil Queen
often points out that Snow White is annoying, and she isn&#x27;t wrong. Why
put someone so annoying in the lead role when there&#x27;s a far more
likable character in Julia Roberts, this is bizarre.<br /><br />This film isn&#x27;t as good as TV&#x27;s Once Upon a time, but whether its
better than Snow White and the Huntsman remains to be seen, but at
least it won&#x27;t have to try that hard.
