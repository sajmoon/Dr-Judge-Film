When I first saw the trailers for &#x22;Mirror Mirror&#x22; a few months ago, I
was pretty excited. It seemed like a &#x22;Princess Bride&#x22; kind of movie
that I could take my kids (ages 10, 8 and 6) to see without worry. Then
I read the reviews, which were mostly negative and started to hesitate
about spending the money to see the film. I finally thought that while
adults might not like it, kids might, so I took them.<br /><br />The result? They all loved it, and that&#x27;s the most important thing.<br /><br />The movie itself was pretty good, but I was a little disappointed that
its not &#x22;The Princess Bride&#x22;. Nowhere close, in fact. But Julia Roberts
and Nathan Lane, both accomplished actors, were excellent in their
scenes together, the seven dwarfs were funny and Lily Collins was very
good as Snow White without overacting. In short, if you have pre-teen
kids, especially girls, go see this movie. Its worth it.
