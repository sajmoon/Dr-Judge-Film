What was Tarsem Omprakash Singh thinking when he was directing this
movie? After Rang De Basanti, expectations were skyrocketing about The
Fall. And the chart-busting music by A.Prasadh only heightened the
frenzy. I was expectantly waiting for Feb. 20th. Boy, this was the
biggest disappointment. What is the story? Who is the hero? Who are the
bad guys? I spent 2hrs 45 mins on the movie and in the end I asked my
friend sitting next to me &#x22;The movie&#x27;s over!?&#x22; . Sorry fellas, this
movie goes down the drain. Lot of clich&#xE9;&#x27;s and the ending seemed to be
borrowed from Bruce Almighty. The first half was a real drag and I was
expecting the story to gather pace after the intermission like The
Fall. Was I disappointed! Lily Collins is dragged into the movie
without one good reason. There are some funny scenes but thats not why
we go for movies. The same cast which was used in Fireflies in the
Garden is reused here. A BIG disappointment overall. My advise, wait
for the movie to come in any of the channels. Not even worth waiting
for the DVD&#x27;s
