In short, this one of the most disappointing movies that I have ever
seen on the big screen. Despite the beautiful graphics and big stars
like Julia Roberts, the film, in the end, felt like the quality of a
made for TV movie. The story began with a grand idea of delivering a
alternative vision to a classic fair tail, but ended filled with holes
in the story line and flow. None of the characters had any depths or
emotional attachment. The entire movie felt like a train wreck of
random scenes and jokes. Julia Roberts did a fantastic as the queen,
but the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast, whom the director
probably found in the back alley of the studio. In conclusion, do not
go see this movie and save your money and more importantly save your
time!
