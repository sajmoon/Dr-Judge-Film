I didn&#x27;t read any reviews on this movie before watching it and I&#x27;m glad
I didn&#x27;t. Had I read all the horrible reviews I might have decided not
to take my daughter to see it and would have missed out on a really
great movie. When I watch movies aimed at adults I will admit that I am
harsh when it comes to how well they hit the nail on the head and etc
but when it comes to children&#x27;s movies, I am mostly concerned with
inappropriate innuendos, violence, and lack of &#x22;fun&#x22;. This film
satisfied me in those areas and gave me a few chuckles as well. My
daughter thoroughly enjoyed it as did I. Unlike that AWFUL AWFUL movie
&#x22;Jack and Jill&#x22; which had me in complete disgust over how inappropriate
it was and upset that I paid over $20 for us to see it, &#x22;Mirror Mirror&#x22;
left me and my daughter satisfied and it didn&#x27;t cost us her innocence
to do the job. I give it a thumbs up and would recommend it for all
ages (young and old). Take the family to see it-- ya&#x27;ll will have a
good time.
