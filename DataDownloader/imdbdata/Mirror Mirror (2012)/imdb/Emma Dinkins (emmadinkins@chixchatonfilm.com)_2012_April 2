2012_April 2 
I have grown a little weary of the whole &#x27;let&#x27;s put a new angle on a
fairy tale&#x27; approach towards classic stories, but ventured out to see
this film attempting to keep an open mind. I guess Cinderella stories
have run their course so that now it&#x27;s time for Snow White (Lily
Collins). This year audiences are fortunate enough to have two
retellings of this classic. Mirror Mirror must have been released first
because it will likely pale in comparison to the subsequent version. I
felt that the animated introduction was way too long and misleading
with the assertion that this is a story about Regina, I mean from The
Queen&#x27;s (Julia Roberts) point of view, which might have been quite
intriguing but then it would have likely been given an &#x27;R&#x27; rating since
you can&#x27;t delve into the true nature of evil without dropping an &#x27;F&#x27;
bomb here are there. I just did not get that The Queen was evil, maybe
a little mean and self obsessed but not evil. I had a difficult time
finding something in this film to embrace warmly, it seemed at times
that the film was trying to harness some of that Alice In Wonderland
magic, but fell short. And what the heck was going on with the dwarfs?
Where was Dopey, Sleepy, Doc and the others? There is such a thing as
veering too far off the straight and narrow, although I did appreciate
that the village was filled with diversity. There were a lot of
ridiculous things taking place on screen in this film, but I will say
that Lily Collins does fit the bill as a fairy Princess. Having become
a fan of One Upon A Time, the fairy tale being retold bar has been
elevated, and once that happens, expectations follow suit. I came to
the theater expecting a humor driven fairy tale and it wasn&#x27;t it was
more silly than funny, case and point as seen in the trailer the puppy
love potion effect and behavior was just like the introduction it was
too long . I wish the story had more in common with The Prince&#x27;s (Armie
Hammer) initial assessment of the dwarfs, short and funny. Mirror
Mirror was definitely geared towards young children because upon
exiting the theater those in attendance seemed quite happy and
satisfied and for that reason I give it a pass with an amber light.
