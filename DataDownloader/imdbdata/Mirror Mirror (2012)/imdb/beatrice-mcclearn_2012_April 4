I walked into this movie expecting another &#x22;fairy tale&#x22; movie. So I was
pleasantly surprised when the plot took a turn for the unexpected. I
loved how the writers used adult humor to keep audience attention. In
addition, the graphics were surprisingly creative; especially when it
came to the 7 dwarfs. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was watching an old fable
play out on the big screen. Instead, I felt that I was being told the
story of Snow White for the very first time. I would recommend this
movie to anyone with a sense of humor, and an appreciation for creative
graphics. If you think you are going to fall asleep in this movie,
think again! Mirror Mirror is a great tale for all.
