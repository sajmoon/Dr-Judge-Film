Hilarious, awesome costumes, great sets, and fantastic imagery! All
these negative nancies need to lighten up and learn to laugh! My
husband even came with me and laughed more than I did! It has the
imagery and colors that the latest Alice in Wonderland (Johnny Depp
version) portrayed! I didn&#x27;t get bored at any point and plan on taking
my mom out to see it! The only problem I had was that I wanted to pluck
Snow&#x27;s eyebrows! ;) And definitely stay for the credits if you love a
good dance song! Go watch the trailers and if none of them make you
laugh, then don&#x27;t go see it. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t see them before I saw
the movie though because the humor is better when it&#x27;s a surprise! I
can&#x27;t wait for this one to come to Blu-Ray with all the special
features!
