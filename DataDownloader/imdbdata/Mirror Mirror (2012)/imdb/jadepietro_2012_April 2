This film is not recommended.<br /><br />Back in my younger days, when I was 9 or 10 years old, I would always
watch and enjoy The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. I think back, with fond
memories of my favorite part of that show, a segment called Fractured
Fairy Tales. Narrated by Edward Everett Horton, these cartoons were
various modernized send-ups of familiar children stories with a wicked
comic bent and clever irony to them. I bring up this experience because
Mirror, Mirror, a film meant to captivate children and adults alike,
tries to capture that same humor and inventiveness, but fails
miserably. The film is still fractured, but it is also dull, contrived,
and extremely unfunny. Where&#x27;s Edward Everett Horton when you need him?<br /><br />Mirror, Mirror takes the Snow White folktale and skews it
ever-so-safely, rather then going to extremes which a fairy tale can
and should do. The film has enough style with its bright production
design and sets by Tom Foden and its lavish costumes by the late Eiko
Ishioka. Those are its few pluses, the minuses, however, are too
numerous to name, but I&#x27;ll start anyway with most of the blame going to
its director. <br /><br />The film&#x27;s director got his start directing music videos, under the
name Tarsem. He then graduated to feature films where his trademark use
of lavish costumes, colorful sets, and an over-dependence of CGI under
the name Tarsem Singh singled him out. Now, taking his full birthname,
Tarsem Singh Dhandwar, he has outdone himself yet again by making one
of the worst films of this movie season. ( And I thought Immortals was
bad! ) Perhaps, by changing his name slightly, he hopes to have a fresh
start in the minds of discriminating moviegoers. Not a chance! His
films have gotten progressively worse. The man certainly has a
wonderful visual sense; it&#x27;s just that he has no common sense when it
comes to selecting woeful scripts.<br /><br />Now let&#x27;s look at the script: writing credits include the Brothers
Grimm ( which I&#x27;m sure they would have requested their names removed
from this project ), Jason Keller, and Melissa Wallack. The writers
follow the conventional formula with some updating of the well-known
material and they try to add some humor, mostly sophomoric, and wry
remarks that are so tired and forced. Their dialog weighs down the
action and rarely advances the plot. Characters are one-note and lines
fall flat, and speaking of flatlining, let&#x27;s discuss the acting.<br /><br />Julia Roberts plays the evil stepmother and ambitious Queen without
much finesse and charm. She never achieves any real menace as the
villainess. Her distinct phrasing and speech pattern vacillates and her
comic timing is off too. She underplays the character when it should
have been more outrageously acted. ( This just may be her worst
performance ever, although I did miss Charlie Thorne. ) Lily Collins,
looking like a second-rate Leslie Caron, has no real charisma as our
spunky heroine, Snow, although Frida Kahlo would be envious of her
beauty. The talented Nathan Lane, as Brighton the Queen&#x27;s servant, is
totally wasted as he minces around the palace, delivering his lines
like an young effeminate Bob Hope. The dwarfs, renamed Napoleon, Half
Pint ( get the humor? ), Grub, Wolf, Butcher, Grimm, and Chuckles, are
innocuous at best, and not the least bit memorable. Only Armie Hammer
as the Prince brings a light comic flair to his role as the studly
suitor.<br /><br />There is no happily-ever-after feeling when the movie finally ends,
although the filmmakers try (and almost succeed in the closing credits
) with a Bollywood wedding number that, at least, has some energy.
Mirror, Mirror is awful, awful. GRADE: D+<br /><br />NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com
