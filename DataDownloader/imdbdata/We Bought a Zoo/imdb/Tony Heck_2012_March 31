&#x22;You know, sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage.
Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I
promise you, something great will come of it.&#x22; Benjamin Mee&#x27;s (Damon)
life is starting to crumble. His wife has died, his son is expelled
from school and he quit his job. In hopes to start a new life they
decide to move and find the perfect house. Then they realize that it&#x27;s
a zoo. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical going in because I
thought that it would be a good movie but really cheesy. I really like
Cameron Crowe though so I expected it to be good from that. I have to
admit that this was one of the best family movies that I have seen in a
long time. The movie had enormous heart, depth and tackled real world
issues while still appealing to all ages. The writing and the acting
were great and the movie absolutely won me over a half hour in. I
highly recommend this one. Overall, this is a must see for families and
is one to buy so you can watch over and over. I give it an A.
