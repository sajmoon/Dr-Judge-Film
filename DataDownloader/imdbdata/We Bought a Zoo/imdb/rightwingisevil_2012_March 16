this is a very pretentious movie masked in a comedy costume. guy&#x27;s wife
died 6 months ago, quit his job from a dying newspaper, with two kids,
one teen and one little girl daughter, and guess what? women already
tried to hook him up, one of them kept sending him lasagna in front of
the school. you believe women would be interested in flirting with a
new widower with two kids? give me a break! then the guy bought a house
in an abandoned zoo, just like if you want to marry a widower, you&#x27;ve
got to marry his kids too. give me a break. guy got deep pocket from
his family&#x27;s limited fund, writing checks, paying bills into the night.
we didn&#x27;t see any realistic deep feeling to his dead wife....the
screenplay is just so stupid and ridiculous that could only happen in a
lousy movie. don&#x27;t know what made people so naively liked this movie.
