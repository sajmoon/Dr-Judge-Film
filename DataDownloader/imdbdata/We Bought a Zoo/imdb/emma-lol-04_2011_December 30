We Bought A Zoo was the most inspiring movie i have ever seen! This
movie will make you laugh and cry but not like a sad cry-but a very
happy cry. The actors/actresses were perfect for this film!Such as Matt
Damon, Scarlett Johansson, Colin Ford, Elle Fanning etc. Colin Ford was
amazing! He did a great job on portraying his character in the film. So
did all the other actors/actresses! They all did a wonderful job! It is
so good that it makes you wanna buy a zoo! It is officially my favorite
movie and when you see it you will be blown away! All i can say is
BEST.MOVIE.EVER!So go see it for yourself, i promise you will love it
like i did! :)
