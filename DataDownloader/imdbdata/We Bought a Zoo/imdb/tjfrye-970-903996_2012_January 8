At one point all guys have usually had a girlfriend that&#x27;s begged us to
take her to a certain movie. Sometimes it&#x27;s something that makes you
want to hide, like say Twilight? Or you get that instance where she
wants you to take her to typical cutsie wootsie date movie full of
happiness, and rays of sunshine gleaming down on the faces of the
innocent, and at first you buckle down and just say &#x22;OK alright not too
bad&#x22;, or maybe you even heard it was an OK movie. Yeah, well We Bought
a Zoo is that second kind of movie I mentioned. It&#x27;s not really
something you would want to go see on your own, but it&#x27;s something
that&#x27;s not really painful to take a girlfriend to. In fact I (a
slightly morbid adolescent who&#x27;s film class projects are influenced by
often dark themes) took a liking to this film. The characters were
fairly well developed, I didn&#x27;t find myself hating any of the
characters that I was supposed to like. At the bare minimum you can
call this movie decent. ---What did I like?--- Well like I said I
really did like the characters. Out of all the characters I liked most,
I would have to say I liked Dylan the most out of all. He&#x27;s a true
exhibition of how you can make a non-likable character actually likable
through the story arc. I felt they really portrayed his emotions in a
sequence that an actual teenager would go through them in the situation
of moving after a parents death. Loss, remorse, anger, physically
portraying the anger in a manifestation (i.e. his dark artworks of
decapitations and monsters), depression, and then finally
acceptance...although the arguments that he has with Matt Damon that is
supposed to make him come around was quite backwards. I felt it should
have been Benjamin coming to comfort Dylan, rather than Dylan being
sorry and accepting his dad. The way it was done just made it feel like
Benjiman was unable to understand his son even after their little
fight. ---What did I hate?--- Although I loved the characters I really
have to admit...I kinda hate the main character. Matt Damon does OK
portraying him I guess, but it&#x27;s just the way that the character is
written. Instead of being a man overcoming uncertain odds, he&#x27;s just
some guy who relies on a never ending supply of optimism to get him
through...and let me be honest this guy is optimistic, so optimistic in
fact that it&#x27;s scary. Sometimes you just want to slap him over the head
and make him feel a different emotion other than pure optimism induced
happiness. Some of you might argue he does have those scenes where he&#x27;s
thinking about his wife and how he&#x27;s crying...but no you&#x27;re wrong. He
might be sad in that scene, but right afterwords he&#x27;s back to being
some happy optimistic guy with a spring in his step. Other than that I
didn&#x27;t hate much...OH! no actually there is one more thing. It was so
annoying how Matt Damon called everyone &#x22;Man&#x22;. He calls his son that in
a huge emotional argument when it really would have been better to say
&#x22;Son&#x22; or &#x22;Dylan&#x22; or something a father really would say, but he doesn&#x27;t
stop there, he call&#x27;s his own love interest Kelly &#x22;Man&#x22; at one point
too; kinda awkward but I digress. Over all this is a fairly good movie
that&#x27;s worth being enslaved by your girlfriend to take you too. Oh and
what about the plot? I&#x27;m not going to review that because it&#x27;s just
straight forward inspirational movie plot. You know &#x22;Guy does something
that puts him in a world with small odds, guy fights through all his
obstacles, tons of false climaxes to keep you on your toes, and then
finally a mooshy climax that makes your heart collapse from sheer
adorability.&#x22; 7/10 Worth a watch, or a red box rental -FryeGuy
