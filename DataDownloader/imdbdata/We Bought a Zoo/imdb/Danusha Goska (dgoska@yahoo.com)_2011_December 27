&#x22;We Bought a Zoo&#x22; is funny, upbeat, and rather slight. Benjamin (Matt
Damon), a widower with two children buys a broken-down zoo, and must
fix it up before he can open it. <br /><br />He struggles with regulations, sickly animals, and escaped snakes. His
adolescent son, Dylan, hates him, and spends his time drawing
nihilistic pictures. His cute daughter thrives. Kelly (Scarlett
Johansson), a zoo keeper, has a crush on him, but he can&#x27;t get over his
deceased wife. His brother, Thomas Haden Church, keeps telling him to
listen to his head, not his heart, and to give up on the zoo. <br /><br />There are plenty of cool animals on screen: lions, tigers, and bears.
The bear is given the most to do. The zookeepers are themselves pretty
exotic and they party and bond. Dylan gets a girlfriend. Otherwise, not
much happens. <br /><br />The final scene didn&#x27;t work for me. Part of the thrust of the movie was
Benjamin moving on from his wife&#x27;s death. But I won&#x27;t reveal the
ending. <br /><br />&#x22;We Bought a Zoo&#x22; is a fun, upbeat movie and a good escape that doesn&#x27;t
offer much to think about. Scarlett Johansson is especially good. She
wears standard zookeeper clothing &#x96; no d&#xE9;colletage &#x96; and she doesn&#x27;t
have any hot scenes. She just, plain, acts &#x96; and she&#x27;s surprisingly
good at it.
