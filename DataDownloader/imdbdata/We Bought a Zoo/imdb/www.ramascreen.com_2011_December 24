-- www.Ramascreen.com --<br /><br />And the 2011 most feel-good movie goes to WE BOUGHT A ZOO. It&#x27;s one of
the most heartwarming, delightful, pleasant family films you&#x27;ll see
this Holiday season. It&#x27;s also an excellent grief-themed movie. Great
ensemble cast, across the board. This is much lighter than what we
usually expect from Cameron Crowe who brought us Jerry Maguire, Almost
Famous, and Vanilla Sky, but after leaving us with the meditational
Elizabethtown, which I didn&#x27;t enjoy very much, and then 6 years hiatus,
WE BOUGHT A ZOO is a very sweet, very nice comeback, a breath of fresh
air&#x85;<br /><br />What I enjoy about Crowe&#x27;s movies is that there&#x27;s always something
personable about them, and it&#x27;s no different with WE BOUGHT A ZOO. This
film is not preachy, it doesn&#x27;t hit you like a ton of bricks, it
doesn&#x27;t drag, it doesn&#x27;t get too sentimental either. It&#x27;s tender yet
firm, a bit predictable yet entertaining. It&#x27;s one of those movies that
make anything seem possible, somewhat of an underdog story, the kind
that&#x27;s generally liked, it&#x27;s a good way for Crowe to tell the world
that he&#x27;s still in the game, without having to alienate his old fans,
while embracing some new ones. Be glad that this is not a talking
animal movie. The animals in WE BOUGHT A ZOO serve as a way to
challenge the humans on their road to healing and triumph.<br /><br />Matt Damon is a fantastic actor because he can be action man in one
movie and he can be your next door regular neighbor joe schmoe in
another. As the single dad, Benjamin Mee, Damon channels a certain
vulnerability that comes with fatherhood. And Damon shows the sorrow
and exhaustion of a newly single parent. I think it&#x27;s great to see
Scarlett Johansson utilizing more than just her good looks. She shows
some range that we remember from Lost In Translation, Girl With A Pearl
Earring and The Horse Whisperer. Johansson is not believable as a
zookeeper, I mean, let&#x27;s face it,.. if you were to name someone who
handles a zoo or cleans animal crap for a living, Johansson would
probably the last person on your list, but she seems self-composed,
which allows her character to be Mee&#x27;s listening ear. Outstanding work
by the teens in this film, Colin Ford who plays Mee&#x27;s angry son, Dylan
and Elle Fanning who plays the socially awkward Elle Fanning. Their
characters embody stereotypical teens and their usual problems with
parents and also with peers their age. Ford and Fanning are actors who
are going to rock Hollywood someday, you just wait and see.<br /><br />Some things don&#x27;t work for me, although I admit Maggie Elizabeth Jones
who plays the little daughter Rosie is absolutely adorable, I think the
film plays out her cuteness way too often, way too much. And I think
it&#x27;s sad that Patrick Fugit who was practically the star of Crowe&#x27;s
2000 Oscar worthy movie, Almost Famous, doesn&#x27;t get to have a
substantial role in this film. All he mostly does is stand there in the
background with a monkey on his back, how sad. Aside from the zoo
aspect, the story itself, in its core, is nothing unique but that
doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a bad thing. It&#x27;s about difficulties of moving
on. The loss of his wife, the mother of his children, leaves a mark
that can&#x27;t easily be replaced by the appeal an unconventional new home.
But as the film suggests, sometimes plans change, and all of a sudden
it&#x27;s not about you anymore. And it&#x27;s not a Crowe movie without such
memorable lines like &#x27;Show me the money&#x27; and &#x27;you had me at hello&#x27;, WE
BOUGHT A ZOO has a hopeful message of taking chances and gambling on
life through 20 seconds of insane courage, loving people, and
adventurous, unadulterated joy. And if you&#x27;re still asking why you
should watch this movie, just say to yourself.. why not?!<br /><br />-- www.Ramascreen.com --
