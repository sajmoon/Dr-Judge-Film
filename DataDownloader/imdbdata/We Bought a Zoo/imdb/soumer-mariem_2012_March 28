I went into this film with low expectations, honestly I thought: what
could be special about it? it&#x27;s just a story about a zoo. well I was
pleasantly surprised. As a matter of fact, it is ,in no case, just a
pointless film about a guy who buys a zoo. It is a movie about life,
about family, and human connections. it is about a father who is
attempting to start over after his wife passed away, a father who is
doing everything he could to keep his family together after an
unfortunate tragedy set them apart. it is about a brave man who saves
the animals and ends up being saved by them in return. it is a
magnificent film featuring great performances from both Matt Damon and
Scarlett Johansson and led by such a wonderful soundtrack. what really
and instantly draw me in in this film is its undeniable honesty. I was
watching it and thinking : that could happen to anyone and when he/she
least expects it. It&#x27;s a journey anyone should experience , because by
the end of the day, we come to the realization that we are all looking
for the same thing that is true joy. isn&#x27;t that what life is all about
? finding true joy ?
