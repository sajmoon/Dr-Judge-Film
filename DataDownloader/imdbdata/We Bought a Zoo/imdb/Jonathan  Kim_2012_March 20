The answer to the query posed in the title is, in effect, what should
determine whether you decide to watch this film. Cameron Crowe&#x27;s latest
work is what one would label as a classic &#x27;feel-good&#x27; movie, or perhaps
even a &#x27;tearjerker&#x27;; the intent of the film, then, is primarily to
explore the relationships between cast members and, in the end, resolve
them in a manner fit for the genre. We Bought A Zoo accomplishes this
with very little missteps along the way, in part due to Matt Damon&#x27;s
ability to convincingly play a widowed father undergoing an emotional
crisis of sorts, and in part because of the phenomenal music utilized
in this film.<br /><br />The film&#x27;s title effectively summarizes the thrust of the plot: an
urban family, in need of change, relocates to a pristinely beautiful
rural area (and house) that just so happens to be a zoo. The family
dynamic is the foundation on which this movie is built: Damon&#x27;s
connection with his son and daughter, and his former wife, drives much,
if not all, of the tale. In conjunction, and perhaps equally important,
is the dynamic between said family and the zoo caretakers; Scarlett
Johansson and others play the residents in charge of animal operations,
and do so admirably. There is no true &#x27;antagonist&#x27; here, although
physical and psychological obstacles are present, and overcome.<br /><br />The soundtrack accompanying Crowe&#x27;s film is, simply put, enthralling.
Jonsi, lead guitarist and vocalist of Sigur Ros, has put together some
of his best work, not simply within the movie&#x27;s context, but also
outside it; this is music that easily stands on its own. Whether one
feels the soundtrack -- and the movie&#x27;s affecting moments -- to be
persuasive or compelling will, of course, depend and fluctuate from
person to person; as a film enthusiast and a veteran of many movies of
this type, I can say that this one was a good, if not great, entry in
the genre. Thus, the answer to my initial self-imposed question is a
definitive YES; I can only hope that it also moves you.
