Director Cameron Crowe did a good job ( Jerry Mcguire was terrific).
Matt Damon as Benjamin Mee, recent widower, father of 2 kids, 7 yr old
Rosie (very cute Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and 14 yr old Dylan (Colin
Ford)plays his part very convincingly. Scarlett Johansson as Kelly
Foster the official zoo keeper is very professional and of course,
beautiful as always. Elle Fanning (Dakota fanning&#x27;s younger sister)
plays the role of Kelly&#x27;s niece. Thomas Haden Church as Matt Damon&#x27;s
older brother is OK ( liked his role in Sideways). This movie may not
be of same tier as Jerry Mcguire but We bought a zoo is very pleasant,
realistic and measures well with my happiness index for seeing a nice
movie (hopefully even by Inspector of Zoo Walter Ferris played by John
Michael Higgins tape measures). The entire star cast was good.
