Cameron Crowe never fails to deliver hart warming drama-comedies that
make you laugh, cry and keep you on the edge of your seat for duration
of his films. For me personally, I never seem to agree with Crowe&#x27;s
casting taste (Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson never do much for me)
but Cameron has a way with actors and a true vision for his story. He
always seems to know exactly who can capture his characters and
ultimately draw out your emotions that he&#x27;s tugging at. <br /><br />In We Bought a Zoo, there is a bit of a slow start and at one point I
was worried Cameron had lowered his voice to appeal to a larger
audience to please producers and critics alike (after his
Critically-bombed but personal all time fav, Elizabethtown). <br /><br />But let me tell you, pay your dues with the first half of this film
because the second half will take you on a mesmerizing cinematic
adventure you&#x27;ll be heartbroken for more. Cameron ventures into a new
family drama without compromising his voice, music taste or quality
film making. And if you are still not a huge CC fan, the animals are
sure to win you over. Their beautiful and natural moments on screen are
as breath taking as they are tear-jerking.<br /><br />Spend an amazing two hours with this film and there won&#x27;t be a person
in your household that won&#x27;t agree that this film is one to remember.
From a fan and living-room-critic, I give it two thumbs up :)
