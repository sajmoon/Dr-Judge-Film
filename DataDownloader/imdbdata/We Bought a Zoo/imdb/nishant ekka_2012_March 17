Its really very difficult to put words that you earnestly like, but I
will humbly try cause all have the right, not to miss something so hard
to express.I liked everything but it not what everyone does, so I&#x27;ll
summarize and compel, so all can make their own decision.<br /><br />Story simple, elegant and very true is based on a family who recently
lost a mother and a wife. Difficult to let go embark for a fresh start.
Out of emotion and desperation for change end up owning a zoo(closed
for last two years). The new owner - prior adventurer - accepts the
challenge to reconstitute it with a personal motives of distraction
from his recent loss. The difficulties, economical bumps and moral
principals underline the new circumstances.The fourteen year old son
who in constant pain, unable to cry for help express only bitterness
towards his father&#x27;s new venture.The zoo with its thinned staff and
uncertain future does not help the cause.In these chaotic grounds the
story unfolds and straighten to a happy endings.<br /><br />The star cast unquestionably the best with Matt Damon at the pinnacle
as the father and adventurer followed by Scarlett Johansson the
dedicated head zoo keeper and refreshing and brilliant addition of
Thomas Haden Church as the buttress and adviser to protagonist brother
and also not to miss out the youngest Maggie Elizabeth Jones the
unbelievably matured eight year daughter with pessimistic son Colin
Ford and his love interest very forward Elle Fanning.Matt Damon clearly
leading the pact with very idealistic figure venerable to human error.<br /><br />The brilliant cinematography with every scene either starting or ending
with picturesqueness of animals and nature giving depth to human
emotions unknowingly. Music consistent and grasping the nature of an
outcome.<br /><br />Dialogues very well written intelligent, charming and unbelievably
knowledgeable with the best pick-up line ever &#x22; Why would an amazing
women like you will even talk to someone like me &#x22; and philosophical
addition as &#x22;twenty seconds of insane courage, just twenty seconds of
embarrassing bravery&#x22; at instant of questionable actions are dully
noted.<br /><br />Finally the great comeback of Cameron Crowe after almost five years
with exceptional movies such as Vanilla Skies, Almost Famous and Jerry
Maguire under his belt and this definitely did not fall below
expectation. Uncanny and very original direction leading all the way. <br /><br />Overall simply joyous and sated.
