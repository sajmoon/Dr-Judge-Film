We Bought A Zoo is for anyone who wishes the world was less cynical,
more hopeful, more filled with joy and joeys and is just a wonderful,
moving, and sincere film that everyone obviously had fun making. <br /><br />The story (based on fact) is of a recent widower, Benjamin Mee, who
sees his two children losing their way after their mother&#x27;s death, and
decides to move them to somewhere new - in this case is a zoo.<br /><br />This is a family movie, albeit that it raises some tough family issues,
but kids with a parent to watch it with (and it should be watched as a
family) should be OK.<br /><br />With a mixture of pathos and nicely timed comedy this is an absolutely
winning film that deserves a wide audience. We loved it.
