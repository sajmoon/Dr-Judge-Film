2012_April 6 
This is based upon a true story. <br /><br />Benjamin Mee (Matt Damon) lost his wife 6-months ago, has a troubled
son and cannot get over his wife&#x27;s death. He quits his job as a writer
doing adventurous things just so he can write about them (guess he
didn&#x27;t know about being a reviewer of adventure-type movies). Now, he
feels he must make changes because everything reminds him of his late
wife. Hence, he buys a Zoo. That should do it, don&#x27;t you think?<br /><br />I am at odds with this movie. I was of the belief this would be a very
warm family type movie and, in some ways, it was. Those &#x22;some&#x22; ways
included 7-year old Rosie (Maggie Jones) and her comments with Benjamin
that seemed she was wise beyond her years and Benjamin&#x27;s flashbacks to
memories of his wife playing with the children. However, other than
those family type scenes, this concentrated more on son Dylan&#x27;s (Colin
Ford) strained relationship with Benjamin and getting the Zoo ready for
opening day. This also tried hard to get Benjamin to move forward after
his wife&#x27;s death.<br /><br />I expected to see more interaction with the animals in a nice fun way.
( No, not the snakes. Ugh!) Didn&#x27;t happen. Hey, this is not a Disney
movie like back in the day. Most of what we see is business as
&#x22;unusual&#x22; with everyone busy, busy, busy trying to get the Zoo ready
after a 2-year layoff. The director must have been on time constraints
as many scenes seemed like they were done with the players on roller
skates. While the pacing may have been too fast all the cast performed
well. <br /><br />And, even though we know Matt Damon as an action hero from the Jason
Bourne movies, he is quite polished as a dramatic actor. His scenes
with everyone were spot on and there was good chemistry with Scarlett
Johansson. The entire cast performed well. <br /><br />The loud, angry confrontation between Benjamin and Dylan was largely
uncomfortable to watch and listen to. We were hoping for a Dylan
epiphany later on. <br /><br />Language: there is some but mostly soft stuff, the S-word and BS words.
However, little 7-yr old Rosie calls the Zoo Inspector (John Michael
Higgins) a part of the male anatomy: a &#x22; D**k.&#x22; Nice warm family movie?
I think not, but almost. <br /><br />Comic relief. Rosie when she wasn&#x27;t calling the Zoo Inspector a name;
and later on Benjamin&#x27;s brother Duncan (Thomas Haden Church) but his
dialogues were largely ineffective and not funny. <br /><br />The statement at the end of the movie says the kids, Dylan and Rosie
are still living on the property, but there is no mention of Benjamin,
Kelly and Lily (Elle Fanning) a love interest of Dylan. So much for
being a true story, and oh yes, a warm family movie as well. (6/10)<br /><br />Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language Soft Stuff. Children under
5-yrs: Not recommended. There are some scary parts with the animals and
snakes. Hey, I jumped at times. Maybe under 8-yrs, 9-yrs &#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;&#x85;you
decide.
