&#xA8;You know, sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage.
Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I
promise you, something great will come of it.&#xA8; 2011 brought us some
surprisingly great family films such as The Muppets and Dolphin Tale,
but I think Cameron Crowe just won me over for the best one of the year
with We Bought a Zoo. I&#x27;m a huge Crowe fan and have loved most of his
films (I even loved Elizabethtown and am not ashamed of admitting it
despite being hated by nearly every critic), especially Almost Famous
and Jerry Maguire. I think this film is up to par with his best work
despite being over sentimental at times. I think that what I like best
about Crowe&#x27;s films are his dialogues. I think he&#x27;s a good writer and
he creates some interesting characters. He usually writes his own
stories for his films, although this time he based it on a true story
and adapted the screenplay from Benjamin Mee&#x27;s biography, but he still
should receive credit for his adaptation. The story isn&#x27;t the only
thing that works, a lot of credit has to be given to Matt Damon for his
performance in the lead role and to the rest of the supporting cast.
Scarlett Johansson had strong chemistry with Damon and her performance
felt believable, Maggie Elizabeth Jones was cuter than any other
character on screen this year, Elle Fanning is almost as amazing as she
was in Super 8 (she&#x27;s turning into my favorite young actress along with
Chloe Grace Moretz), while Thomas Haden Church, John Higgins, and Angus
Macfadyen provided most of the laughs in the movie. Colin Ford had to
play kind of the rebellious teen son and he did a decent job although
he perhaps had the least interesting character. The animals also play a
huge part in the overall effectiveness of the film.<br /><br />The film is based on a true story about a father named Benjamin Mee
(Matt Damon) who after losing his wife has to raise his two children on
his own in Southern California. His fourteen year old son, Dylan (Colin
Ford, a young Bon Jovi lookalike) is going through a very dark time and
is having trouble at school. He ends up being expelled for stealing
some money and for painting a very dark mural. His seven year old
daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) is a lot closer to her father
and is cuter than any other girl her age. She is sweet and always
smiling, a complete contrast to Dylan. Benjamin becomes tired of the
city life and quits his job as a journalist and decides to buy a new
home in the countryside. This new home is big, has lots of space, but
it comes with one special responsibility: it is a zoo. Benjamin decides
it&#x27;s time to begin a new adventure and decides to repair the zoo in
time to open it for the public in the summer. The zoo is pretty much
abandoned, but with the help of a few workers left Benjamin begins
putting his life savings into it in order to restore it in time before
the next inspection. Kelly Foster (Scarlett Johansson) has worked at
the zoo for several years and becomes his right hand helper, along with
Peter (Angus Macfadyen), Robin (Patrick Fugit), and her thirteen year
old niece Lily (Elle Fanning). Benjamin&#x27;s accountant brother Duncan
(Thomas Haden Church) warns him about the financial risks involved, but
he decides to go with his heart and live a new adventure.<br /><br />If you&#x27;ve seen a Cameron Crowe film before then you know this won&#x27;t
just be a family film. Crowe loves music and he always includes some
really great soundtracks in his stories. He also manages to include one
or two dialogues based on music. He makes a reference to Dylan being
named after the great Bob Dylan, but later we realize he was really
named Dylan for his dog. Just like the Crowe humor isn&#x27;t missing here,
the romantic stories aren&#x27;t left out either. Crowe is a romantic at
heart. We&#x27;ve seen some of the most famous romantic lines in movies like
Jerry Maguire, such as &#xA8;you had me at hello,&#xA8; but here he also includes
a few lines that will be memorable like the &#xA8;twenty seconds of insane
courage&#xA8; one. The film is really worth a watch, it is for everyone, it
has a love story, several funny scenes, an inspiring story, and several
cute animals. Adults and children will enjoy this film alike. I was
surprised to hear the characters in which this film was based actually
had a cameo near the end of the movie. The real Benjamin and his two
children were the first in line to climb the fallen tree in order to
reach the zoo. Matt Damon is such a reliable actor; he has had a great
year, but the true heart of the film here relies on the cuteness of
Elle Fanning, Maggie Elizabeth Jones, and the animals. Yes this film
might be over sentimental and cheesy at times, but it&#x27;s so cute that
it&#x27;s hard to resist.<br /><br />http://estebueno10.blogspot.com
