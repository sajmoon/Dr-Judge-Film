At the end of the day, I found myself underwhelmed by We Bought a Zoo.
I really wanted to care for it more than I did, but somewhere during
the filming of this movie, the emotional response I should have had
just got lost by the film makers. Cameron Crowe at least puts good
effort into his direction. His photography is lovely, the music by
Jonsi is wonderful (Especially the beautiful ending song &#x22;Gathering
Stories&#x22;), and Matt Damon, as always, gives a great performance,
earning honest sympathy.<br /><br />But this is about as far as I can go. The rest that Crowe does isn&#x27;t
particularly great. There&#x27;s some decent performances, including Thomas
Haden Church&#x27;s occasional humorous touches, and John Michael Higgins
playing... John Michael Higgins. But then we also have Scarlett
Johansson, who continues to leave me a bit disappointed, making me
wonder if she&#x27;ll ever prove her excellent performance in Lost in
Translation was more than a fluke.<br /><br />Then we get down to Crowe&#x27;s biggest issue, his own script, which
practically shouts mediocre. There&#x27;s a scene in the film where Damon
gives a small, cheesy speech to pep up the zoo workers, and then the
film cuts to a small monkey slapping its own forehead. What you might
see as a throwaway gag, I saw as an unintentional self metaphor. The
movie forces schmaltz on us, especially in the dialogue, which is
seriously awful. I sometimes hear people complaining about War Horse,
mainly because detractors point fingers at so called &#x22;forced
sentimentality&#x22;. If they think THAT&#x27;S bad, wait until they get a load
of this sucker.<br /><br />** out of ****
