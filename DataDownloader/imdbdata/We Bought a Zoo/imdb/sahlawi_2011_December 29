Since 2002, I did not see Scarlett act, and 9 years later she delivered
this, which is not as good as her acting in Lost in translation, but
defiantly getting better. Matt Damon was superb, as always! I cant say
no more when it comes to Damon. Also, Thomas Haden, who played Damon&#x27;s
brother in the movie, added a nice comedy touch to the movie and made
you smile several times. Maggie Elizabeth Jones, who played the
daughter, was surprisingly good as well. Am always impressed when I see
young actors/actress perform so well.<br /><br />As I read the book, I think it was pretty good, they tried to capture
most of what happened and focused on the most important and touching
events. What I didn&#x27;t like in the movie was the how some the music that
was playing on some scenes did cut off and start without blending it to
the scene before or after, this thing did sometimes bother me.
