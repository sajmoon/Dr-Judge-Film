We bought a Zoo was a heart-warming family film which touches your
heart along with a very good story and captivating performances.
Benjamin Mee is a columnist who loses his wife six months back. To
start afresh along with his kids , he goes for house-hunting and finds
a large house in the country side. However , to his shock he finds the
house in the midst of an old zoo which was closed down 2 years back. To
get back into shape, Benjamin decides to acquire the property and
renovate the zoo and even plans to re-open it. The challenge is to pass
a zoo inspection to re-open the zoo for public. The director of Jerry
Maguire and Almost Famous , Cameron Crowe , has chosen the story which
is so heartfelt and leaves you with a message of doing something for
the society. Crowe is superb and climbs to next level with matured
direction. Each frame is executed efficiently. The screenplay is
captivating. The dialogues are good. Cinematography is eye-catching .
Matt Damon as Benjamin Mee puts in a sincere performance. He plays the
role of struggling father with effectiveness and comes out with a brave
performance. Rest of the star cast did justice to their part. So ,
Overall , nice and heartwarming story with a beautiful message.
Recommended. Very Good &#x96; 4/5
