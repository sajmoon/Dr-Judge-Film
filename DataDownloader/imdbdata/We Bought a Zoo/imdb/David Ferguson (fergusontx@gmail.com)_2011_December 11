Greetings again from the darkness. Director Cameron Crowe has finally
emerged from his cocoon - 7 years after the abysmal Elizabethtown. Yes,
he has had a couple of projects in that time, notably the Pearl Jam
documentary, but he has avoided anything related to his dramatic film
roots of which produced &#x22;Say Anything&#x22;, &#x22;Jerry Maguire&#x22; and &#x22;Almost
Famous&#x22;. This time he delivers a feel good, family appropriate,
sentimental crowd-pleaser that should play very well to the holiday
crowd.<br /><br />Please know I do not use &#x22;sentimental&#x22; as a derogatory term. Sure there
are moments where the actions and dialogue seem contrived and
manipulative, but some of the best crowd-pleasers throughout Hollywood
history have these same traits. This film is based on a true story and
uses Benjamin Mee&#x27;s autobiographical book as the basic source material.
The real Mee family and their zoo, are stationed in England, not
southern California as Crowe presents them. What I can tell you is that
this version of the Mee family and the zoo staff is interesting and
entertaining, even if you just have to let go and allow yourself to be
guided through.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Benjamin Mee and the story picks up after his wife
dies. He soon quits his job and moves his two kids to the country so
they can work through their grief and start fresh. His teenage son
Dylan is played with blazing anger by the talented Colin Ford. The
precocious 7 year old daughter is played by scene-stealer Maggie
Elizabeth Jones. This family experiences the realities of struggling
with their pain and difficulties in communicating.<br /><br />As for the zoo, it is in major disrepair and in danger of closing if it
doesn&#x27;t pass its pending inspection. Benjamin works with the rag-tag
staff, including head zookeeper Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), to bring
the facility up to code and nurse the sick animals back to health. As
the zoo is rehabbed, so are the individuals. No surprise there.<br /><br />The main conflict in the story comes from the hard-headedness of
Benjamin and Dylan, as they ignore their inability to communicate and
connect as father and son. A couple of their scenes together are the
best in the film for acting and realistic dialogue. At the same time,
Kelly acts as a quasi-love interest for Benjamin, while Lily (Elle
Fanning) uses puppy love to help Dylan through his misery. That
sub-plot is where Crowe missed a real chance. Ms. Fanning is one of the
top young actresses working today and her contributions here are
limited to that luminescent smile.<br /><br />The wild cast of supporting actors includes wise-cracking Thomas Haden
Church as Benjamin&#x27;s brother, JB Smoove as the Realtor, Peter Riegert
as Mee&#x27;s editor, Patrick Fugit (from Almost Famous) as the guy with a
monkey on his shoulder, Angus Macfadyen as the colorful zoo maintenance
man, and John Michael Higgins as the snooty zoo inspector who knowingly
holds their future in his smarmy hand.<br /><br />As always, Crowe uses music better than most any other director. This
includes his use of score and soundtrack to compliment a scene or drive
the setting and mood. What really makes this film work is Matt Damon.
His character is the heart of the film and the soul of the family. His
performance is strong enough to prevent the film from lapsing into pure
sap and makes us care for him, his family and this zoo. Don&#x27;t expect
some cutting edge, independent sulk fest. Just accept the movie for
what it is ... a feel good story delivered for the holidays.
