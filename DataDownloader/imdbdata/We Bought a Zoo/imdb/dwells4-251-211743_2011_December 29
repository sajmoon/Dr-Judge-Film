The MPAA whiffed on this one. Obviously they gave it a PG rating to
bait parents with young kids into the theaters this holiday season. 4
sh!ts, 1 a hole, and a 7 year old telling a grown up that he&#x27;s a d!ck
is not appropriate for my 8 year old. PG means PARENTAL GUIDANCE, It&#x27;s
good to give parental guidance on an issue like &#x22;mom died&#x22; and &#x22;why did
the tiger go to heaven&#x22; things that shouldn&#x27;t be in a &#x22;G&#x22; movie. To
make matters worse, they OUT THE EASTER BUNNY!! Seriously not the
conversation I was wanting to have on the drive home. The movie would
have been just as good without all of the swearing and easter bunny
outing. Without it, this would have definitely made it into our DVD
library. Hope the Hollywood a holes that decide on these things think
it was worth all the money they&#x27;ll lose when parents don&#x27;t buy their
stinkin&#x27; DVD. BTW, I&#x27;m not about censorship, my favorite movie is Pulp
Fiction. But My wife and I depend on the ratings people to help guide
us a little when traveling unchartered waters of the movie theater.
They totally failed us this time in the name of the almighty dollar.
