I almost missed We Brought a Zoo. Its poster looks like the wrapping of
a white chocolate. My friends picked the movie, and walking into the
theater I didn&#x27;t even know Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson were in
it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised. The pair&#x27;s charming performance (along with
a strong supporting cast) makes the somewhat far-fetched story come
alive. And a mesmerizing score by Icelandic musician, Jonsi, creates an
absorbing ambiance to help it hit all the sweet spots.<br /><br />Some of the relationships are underdeveloped, and the plot is somewhat
manipulative and does feel fluffy at times, but sometimes some movies
are just heartfelt enough for you to ignore their flaws and willingly
buy into the premise. I am glad to call We Bought a Zoo one of these
movies. It might not work well for the skeptical eyes, but it would
certainly be a delicious experience, both visually and acoustically,
for those who walk in with open minds.
