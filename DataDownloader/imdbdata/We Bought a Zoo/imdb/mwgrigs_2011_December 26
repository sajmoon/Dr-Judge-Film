Great feel-good movie! The story was strong and I thought the actors
pulled off likable performances. Hollywood always pushes the envelope
of their artistic license, blurring the lines between the factual and
fictional elements of movies &#x22;based on a true story&#x22; and this was no
exception. Nevertheless, it was very enjoyable and had memorable
characters and memorable moments. Definitely one to watch again. Only
real down side for me was the amount of &#x22;adult language&#x22; sprinkled
throughout this family film.<br /><br />Okay, I get it: it&#x27;s Hollywood and it&#x27;s the new millennium, but why the
need to embellish the script with so many &#x22;colorful expletives?&#x22; I&#x27;m no
saint and I let my own four-letter words fly every now and then, but
when a movie is billed as a family flick, you gotta at least give
parents a fair chance. Here&#x27;s a clue Hollywood: When your movies are
edited and played on T.V.--they&#x27;re still just as good. In this movie,
the language was just unnecessary and added nothing to it. Minus the
unnecessary language, this movie gets a solid 8.
