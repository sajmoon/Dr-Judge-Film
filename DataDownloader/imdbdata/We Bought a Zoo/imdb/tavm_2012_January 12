A heartwarming family drama was not something I expected from either
Matt Damon or director Cameron Crowe but when I ended up watching this
with my movie theatre-working friend today, that&#x27;s what I got and to
tell the truth, I actually liked what I saw. Whatever conflict arises
in such a not-so-intense film mostly arises between that of Damon and
his teenage son who hasn&#x27;t completely gotten over the death of his
mother. There&#x27;s also some amusing scenes featuring that of the
inspector played by John Michael Higgins. Oh, and Scarlett Johansson as
the potential love interest was also pretty good. Really, all I&#x27;ll say
now is if you like this kind of thing, I highly recommend We Bought a
Zoo.
