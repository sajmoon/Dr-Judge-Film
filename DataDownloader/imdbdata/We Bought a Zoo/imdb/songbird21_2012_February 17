It was a fun movie. That said I was shocked to hear the S-word in it
not once, not twice, but *four* times! The also had a 7 year old girl
say d**k. Very inappropriate for my 10 year old daughter. <br /><br />If your kids are 13 and up you should see this movie otherwise I would
wait a few years. How this got a PG rating is BEYOND me. Last I
checked, a PG rating didn&#x27;t include any of the heavy seven (The big
swears not allowed on network TV).<br /><br />The acting is good and the story is heartwarming. The kids are
adorable. <br /><br />There is a girl at the zoo who is a love interest for the owner&#x27;s son
but she really isn&#x27;t much more than that. She barely says anything
worthwhile and then suddenly the boy is falling in love? Not very
believable.<br /><br />There is a woman at the zoo who becomes a love interest for the owner.
While she is a decent character, there was nothing in the story that
made me think &#x22;These two *have* to get together&#x22;. The romance was
forced and fell flat.
