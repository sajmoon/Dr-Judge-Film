This movie was one hell of a surprise for me! A little while ago, I was
really looking forward to it since I&#x27;m such a fan of Matt Damon and I
adored his most recent movie The Adjustment Bureau. I&#x27;m glad this was
my first advanced screening.<br /><br />Another thing was that I&#x27;m probably one of the first people to see this
movie and I&#x27;m happy for it! The story was involving and kept me glued
to the screen, the little romances between some of the characters were
cute and believable, and most of all, THE LITTLE GIRL! She was so cute
and an incredible actress for her age!<br /><br />The script was phenomenal and the performances were stellar. The
direction was great (expected considering Cameron Crowe, director of
acclaimed Jerry Maguire) as well. It made me feel very happy and will
most definitely take you out of a dark place if you&#x27;re in one.<br /><br />Only one gripe was that it was pretty predictable considering the
trailer. But, avoid the trailer if you really want to be in love with
this movie. I still was! Despite having had seen the trailer.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, great Christmas flick! <br /><br />Full 10/10. No, I wasn&#x27;t involved in this movie at all. Just got a very
lucky advanced screening.
