Of course, the movie waits until the end to let you know that it is
about a REAL family who bought and ran a REAL zoo. But heck, it was
just good old-fashioned filmmaking that made it so enjoyable.<br /><br />Damon is, as always, wonderful. So many funny scenes and &#x27;telling
spots&#x27; about how much Mr. Mee had to do to bring everything up to
standards. And you just want the movie to continue, even though it has
reached its conclusion.<br /><br />Again, wanted to walk right back in and see the whole thing again -
something no movie in a long while has made me want to do, not even
LOTR. But of course, that would be so long to see again, right away.<br /><br />All the interplay between characters was great and you really began to
CARE about them all, even the pesky zoo inspector. Well, OK, you really
wanted to slap him. But in the end, everything worked out beautifully.<br /><br />Go see it. It&#x27;s that wonderful and cheering.
