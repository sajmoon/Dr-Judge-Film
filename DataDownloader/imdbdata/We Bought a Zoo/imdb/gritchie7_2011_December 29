Cameron Crowe does it again. He constantly plays with the heart strings
in this one, but there are many smiles and you leave the cinema
inflated with happiness and inspiration (a rarity in today&#x27;s cinema).
The cinematography was a delight and I often felt like I was watching a
BBC episode of Planet Earth but with human drama and comedy. Best of
both genres!<br /><br />Matt Damon is excellent as usual. An actor who can talk about anything
and have you totally captivated (He should run for congress like in The
Adjustment Bureau). So was the rest of the cast, especially the kids.
The music was also superb as in all CC movies.<br /><br />In summary, I can&#x27;t recommend this movie enough, unless your a cynic!
