We Bought a Zoo... There are not enough movies that teach what it means
to care. Matt Damon and cast turn in a very good performance in this
light, but powerful movie about reestablishing a famous zoo that had
been shut done but functioning for the last two years. My wife and I
went to the movie on a whim due to our love of Cameron Crowe, and were
not disappointed. Crowe always has a focus of building the characters
up in a playful way (Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous). The 7 year old
daughter played by Maggie Elizabeth Jones, and the older brother played
by Thomas Hayden Church were well done. They added the right comic
humor to kept the movie uplifted. In addition, it was good to see
Patrick Fugit again, he was so great in Almost Famous. The movie, based
on a true story of a widower buying a zoo, at times tilted toward being
overly dramatic, but never tipped. Overall WE BOUGHT A ZOO is not a
Oscar worthy movie, but a movie that will have you leaving the theater
feeling good.
