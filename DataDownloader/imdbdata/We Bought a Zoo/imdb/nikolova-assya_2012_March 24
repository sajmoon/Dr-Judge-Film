It made me cry... It made me cry in the most purifying way that I
haven&#x27;t cried in a long, long time. It set me free! It also made me
laugh of course, and sent out some butterflies in my stomach, so you
have it all. I loved it because of the great actor&#x27;s play - Matt
strikes as The Dad, nice to see Scarlett so laboring and down to earth
with no drama involved and I should say that Thomas is my N1 grumpy
uncle ever. Even better - the kids are great, especially little Maggie
who at her soft age is already so truthful that takes hold of your
heart right away. But of course behind all that we have great story. At
first I anticipated some cheesiness, but, Oh deary, how wrong I was. In
this hard times that we are leaving, getting more and more complicated
and painstaking, everyone of us can relate to a story of getting over
hardship and find something true in it. Especially when you get some
animals and outdoors involved and show what is good and noble in
people. So after a hard day or for a moment you want to make special
and connect to the people dear to you, you should really go and BY A
ZOO.
