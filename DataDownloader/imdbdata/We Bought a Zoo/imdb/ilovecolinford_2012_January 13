For Christmas, my family and i went to watch this move. Watching movie
is really part of my daily life, i go to the cinemas almost every week
but this movie, we bought a zoo has been the most amazing movie yet and
its actually the first movie that made me cry, THREE TIMES! during the
film i kept wishing &#x27;oh i wish this movie didn&#x27;t finish i wish there is
still a long way to go!&#x27; thats how amazing it was to me the amazing
performances from all the actors made it so touching its a movie where
you wont get tired of even though you watch it over and over again i
really have interests in movies and i really want to be a movie
director when i grow up but people say being a movie director is hard
and getting incomes is hard and so i thought about forgetting to
achieve this dream but this movie inspired me to continue dreaming to
be a movie director we bought a zoo has been the biggest inspiration to
me thank you cameron crowe oh and i love colin ford :)
