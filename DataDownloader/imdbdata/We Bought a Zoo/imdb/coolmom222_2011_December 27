I was planning to take my kids to see this until I (thankfully) read
reviews first. How in the world is this rated PG and not PG13? Does
that mean it&#x27;s OK for kids under 13 to use the long list of four-letter
words in this movie, as long as their parents are there with them
during the movie?? Give me a break.....I can understand the part about
dealing with the death of a family member, as many young children have
to do that at some time or another, but this movie could have been made
as is without the foul language that will surely get a young child in
big trouble at school if the child goes to class and quotes the movie
to friends. Were they afraid that they wouldn&#x27;t get any award
nominations without the s word? Or that people wouldn&#x27;t buy tickets
unless they knew that there was bad language? That&#x27;s like saying that
Matt Damon isn&#x27;t enough of a draw.....they had to throw in some shock
value to make up for other areas where the film might be lacking.
