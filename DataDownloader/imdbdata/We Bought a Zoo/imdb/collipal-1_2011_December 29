Director Cameron Crowe is not very prolific, but he has a big number of
followers thanks to the semi-independent sensibility he brings to
common subjects of commercial cinema, from the &#x22;grunge&#x22; romantic comedy
Singles to the &#x22;coming of age&#x22; in a rock-and-roll environment Almost
Famous (by the way, my favorite film from his filmography so far). Now,
we see him applying the same tactics in the family cinema with his most
recent film, We Bought a Zoo, and the result is excellent.<br /><br />The story from We Bought a Zoo might sound manipulative and excessively
sentimental, but the truth is that We Bought a Zoo is developed with
elegance and dignity, with good moments of humor and dosing the
dramatic scenes in order to emphasize the characters&#x27; evolution, and
not to make us cry with easy narrative traps. We Bought a Zoo also
includes a sub-plot of romantic tension between the main character and
the responsible woman of the zoo, but it is enough subtle not to
obstruct the flow from the screenplay nor to divert the focus of the
story, so it is very satisfactory to see how the challenges presented
by the restoration of the zoo fill in the &#x22;emotional holes&#x22; in the
lives of the characters. And, sure, the animals themselves have an
important participation with their antics, cunning and some unavoidable
sad moments in order to remind us that &#x22;chasing the dreams&#x22; is not
always magical and pleasurable.<br /><br />In the leading role, Matt Damon is totally credible as a common man
whose overwhelming responsibilities are not enough to cloud his
optimism, nor his determination to bring up his family. Scarlett
Johansson also makes a solid work in a character which transcends the
mere romantic interest in order to become the main character&#x27;s
conscience. The rest of the actors fit perfectly in their roles, from
Elle Fanning to Angus Macfayden without forgetting Thomas Haden Church,
who is very funny as the main character&#x27;s skeptical brother.<br /><br />The only thing I can say against this movie is that a few moments feel
a bit artificial. For the rest, I enjoyed We Bought a Zoo very much,
and I definitely recommend it, specially to parents who are tired of
noisy animated films; and to the fans of Crowe who needed validation
after the badly received Elizabethtown (which I personally did not feel
bad, but mediocre). I doubt the fact that Crowe will reach the height
of Almost Famous ever again, but his career is definitely on the right
track.
