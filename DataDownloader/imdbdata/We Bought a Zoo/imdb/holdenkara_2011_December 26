I am grateful that in this cynical world, there are still artists who
are courageous enough not to run from earnestness, but to embrace it.
Cameron Crowe has done just that with WE BOUGHT A ZOO. This is a
beautiful movie, full of life - truthfully acted, beautifully shot and
lovingly directed. I expected to cry (which I did, many times) but I
didn&#x27;t know that it would also be so funny with levity coming just when
you need it. Matt Damon was brilliant as the heartbroken but hopeful
father. And my only gripe about Thomas Haden Church is that there
wasn&#x27;t more of him! The kids were all brilliant -- not an ounce of
self-consciousness to their acting, which is rare when it comes to
child actors. And the final scene alone is worth the price of
admission. Anyone willing to open his or her heart will fall in love
with this movie like I did. Kudos to all involved.
