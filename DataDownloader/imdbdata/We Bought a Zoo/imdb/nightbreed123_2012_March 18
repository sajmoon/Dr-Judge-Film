I was dubious about this film purely from the title. I was absolutely
mistaken, this film was a brilliant watch from start to finish. I was
blown away from start to finish, Matt Damon was brilliant, as well as
all the cast, I cant fault this film, it is going to go down as one of
my top tens of all time! If you want to go through the roller-coaster
of emotions then this is the film to watch, I was laughing, crying and
cringing! Cringing at the fantastic scenes when the dangerous animals
were feet away from actors. Crying at the touching scenes, which were
filmed brilliantly. The young actors in this film are amazing, the
stars of tomorrow. This film deserves awards! Matt, you are going to
need a bigger shelf! Just see, don&#x27;t worry about the title, it will
make you happy and write a review on here.
