The movie is marketed and the outside view of the movie would be about
a guy who bought a zoo and all that entails. But it&#x27;s also about a
grieving family and them disconnecting and eventually having to come
back together as a whole.<br /><br />Benjamin Mee moves his family to a new house to get a fresh start but
it&#x27;s not until after he looks at the perfect place does he realize that
it&#x27;s also a zoo.<br /><br />The zoo that he purchased had been shut down for a few years at that
point and they have to overcome those just to re-open the park. One
major factor is dealing with an older tiger who&#x27;s coming to the end of
his time and another is when a bear escaped the park and they have to
get him back in without incident.
