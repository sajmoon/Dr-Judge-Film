Though this may not particularly stand out in the glories and triumphs
in this Oscar season, it is a little piece of brilliantly filmed
adventure and family movie with important life lessons and messages,
and definitely is one of my personal favorites of the year.<br /><br />&#x22;We Bought a Zoo&#x22; is refreshing, inspirational and simple. It is about
a father (Matt Damon)&#x27;s story in his newly purchased zoo after the
devastating death of his wife&#x27;s death. It is about him chasing dreams,
learning to let go and at the same time trying to keep his family
happy.<br /><br />This is a definite choice if you are looking for moving family films
with important messages presented in not a too complex manner.<br /><br />- dchgl.blogspot.com
