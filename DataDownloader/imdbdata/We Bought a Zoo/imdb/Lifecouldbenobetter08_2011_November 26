I seen this movie at a Saturday sneak preview. and it was good. it was
Smart and Funny and Witty and it had Drama. this is a movie that comes
out December 23. the movie starts as the Talented Matt Damon and the
Lovely Scarlett Johanson. with a very cute and funny little girl. who
brings such a young fun vibe to the screen. as well as Elle Fanning.
yes she is Dakota Fannings sister. who is a fresh face to the screen.
who is talented as she plays a young girl with a love story. as she was
in Super 8 as well. but the movie is about a man and his 2 children
have lost a dear one. and they then hope to make a move for a fresh
start. the animals are fun and the movie plays out well with the
animals. as they live at the zoo. but like all movies it has it happy
parts and sad parts and funny parts. but it all works out well. and i
would hope you all try this movie out and love it. as much as i liked
it. but this is a movie for the Family. so sit back and enjoy. and the
movie was well done from the script to the actors. it just right. so go
see it. bye
