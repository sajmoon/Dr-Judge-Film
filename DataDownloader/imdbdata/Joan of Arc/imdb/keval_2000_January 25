<br /><br />As a graphic portrayal of a paranoid schizophrenic medieval peasant girl
fighting for the feminist cause under the guise of a nationalist freedom
fighter, it managed to keep me from yawning too often amongst my fellow
cinema goers. If however, it was intended as an honest bio-pic of a
national
hero, venerated and canonised by the Vatican 500 years after her brutal
execution, then I'm afraid I'd rather spend the money on a history book,
and
settle down with a bottle of wine, whilst my more than adequately vivid
imagination works wonders making its own mental images.<br /><br />Sometimes you enter a cinema wanting to know more about the historical
subject of the film. And, sometimes, perhaps because of the clever
direction
or writing of the screenplay, you leave knowing less than before, but only
because the film raises important social, historical and ethical issues.
When I left the cinema, I wanted to demand that someone, somewhere pay for
the celluloid atrocity I had been subjected to.  The entire premise of the
film seemed to be based on the irritating ramblings of a girl who was
hearing voices. Apparently our disturbed Joan decided that these were
messages from God, and being particularly  vulnerable to apparitions,
illusions, call then what you will, deemed herself God's messenger to the
people of France. The battle between the English and French for control of
Orleans is the political back drop for the life of simple Joan, who
reveals
in all her heavenly innocence, after defeating the English in a battle,
that
bloodshed is not what she wants (whilst standing amidst the slaughtered
remains of hundreds of French soldiers).<br /><br />The diplomatic relations between the English and the French are stretched
to
breaking point, until the Dauphin of France is crowned King - a victory he
attributes to the efforts of Joan. However, since war is expensive her
usefulness ceases to be obvious and negotiations between these hostile
enemies are resumed. Whilst the French masses die of hunger and poverty,
ignorant of the callous neglect with which the monarch carries out his
duties, Joan waits for more signs from the only authority she recognises.
Our imbalanced heroin is determined to fight the good fight and continue
on
to Paris. With a reckless neglect of her soldiers not dissimilar to her
own
King, she is forced to face the horrific reality of the situation - that
unlike her, politics has no cause. The French monarchy soon starts to get
jittery with this religious loose cannon and, although we all more or less
know about Joans' eventual demise, I wont' spoil the ending.<br /><br />The most interesting scenes by far are Joan's conversations with her
conscience whilst she is awaiting trial (played comically by Dustin
Hoffman)
which ultimately lead her to question her motives in fighting for her
cause.
However, the bigger and far more important questions are related to her
own
mental health. Events in her child hood had indeed left her scarred and
undoubtedly result in her fanatical actions but the full extent of her
psychoses are never really looked into, apart from the reckless manner in
which she lunges into battle.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I regard the visual and auditory imagery of Mr.
Besson's
films as amongst the most powerful and vivid in the film business,
especially considering the sheer volume pumped out of the industry.
However,
this time I believe the imagery was created at the expense of a
well-written
screenplay, and would have benefited from a more insightful examination of
the fragmented and disturbed personality that was Joan, rather than the
superficial look at the religious crusader whom we have heard so little
about in depth.<br /><br />Try and get hold of a good book that deals with the subject matter in a
more
entertaining and informative way.<br /><br />Harshad C. Keval
