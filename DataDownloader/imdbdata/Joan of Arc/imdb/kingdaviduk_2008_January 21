It was a bit hard to follow at times, and in the middle, with all the
battle scenes, I found it a bit boring. Also the battle scenes were too
gory and although it showed what the battles were probably really like,
and the brutality of war, it was not at all pleasant and a bit
overdone. It got more interesting towards the end, but overall it was a
slow film. It could have been cut and made shorter, at 2.5 hours it is
too long. Also the text on screen was a little difficult to read, it
was in a very old-fashioned font and too small. The acting was done
very well and the whole look of the film was realistic and believable.
Some parts of the film were a bit difficult to follow.
