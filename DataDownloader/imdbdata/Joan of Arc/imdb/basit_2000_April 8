2000_April 8 

In typical Luc Besson style, the visuals are sumptuous, the story fluid, the
poitics engaging and the acting, if nothing else, quirky.<br /><br />Not being able to tell how much of this account of the story of Joan of Arc
is fact and how much is fiction, I still found the characters to be
watchable and believable. <br /><br />This is a solid effort at historical story telling. The only other thing I
would say is that Milla Jovovich makes an excellent effort at sustaining the
intensity and god-concsiousness within her character that one would have
expected, but does come over as a little lost sometimes (maybe intentionally
so, when you consider that Joan of Arc was only 19 when she died
anyway)<br /><br />Worth seeing.
