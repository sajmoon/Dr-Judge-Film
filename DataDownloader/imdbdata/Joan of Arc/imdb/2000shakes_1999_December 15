1999_December 15 

The only reason I'm spending the time to post a comment here is to warn
you
not to waste two and half hours of your life on this film, like I
did.<br /><br />Even though I had heard mixed reviews, I went into the theatre with a very
positive attitude about this film, since I've enjoyed Besson's past films,
as well as the work of many of this cast.<br /><br />Looking back, I should have followed my gut instinct and left about a
minute
and a half into the film: pretty much any time a filmmaker uses a Gothic
typeface in titles and expository text and then adds something ridiculous
like blood running over a map, you can bet your life that the rest of the
film will show the same stupidity, lack of taste, and disrespect for the
intelligence of the viewer.  The murder/rape (in that order) a few minutes
later confirmed my first impression, but for some reason I
stayed.<br /><br />Maybe I stayed because I teach classes on film and watch a lot of movies,
and I am more than willing to give ANY film a fair shot (and sometimes two
or three).  I wanted this film to succeed.  But it falls down on so many
levels that I felt my own calling from God, as it were, to wage a small
battle against it.<br /><br />The reviews published by the San Francisco papers, NY Times and Chicago
Sun-Times (Ebert) give a pretty good summary of what's wrong with this
film,
even though I think their &quot;two stars&quot; ratings are quite
generous.<br /><br />To summarize my own thoughts on the film, I feel that the script doesn't
know what story it's trying to tell, and Besson and Jovovich seem to have
no
sense at all for the complexities of Joan's story, as it has come down to
us.<br /><br />The acting is as overwrought and void of subtlety as any I've seen in a
long
time.  The only highlights are a couple of performances from supporting
characters (who unfortunately are shackled by the poor screenplay) and
Dustin Hoffman's appearance toward the end of the film (way too little,
way
too late to save the film).  I felt particularly saddened by the clownish
performance John Malkovich gives, although I can't help but think/hope
that
he was forced to do it by Besson.  (I wondered while watching the scene
where Joan tells Charles about her revelations whether Malkovich was
mocking
Jovovich . . . and the whole production for that matter.)<br /><br />Everything else you see in the film (art direction, costume design,
soundtrack, special effects, even the look of every single supporting and
bit player, etc. etc.) is as cliche and unimaginative as the screenplay
and
acting.  It feels as if Besson and Co. sat down and said, &quot;What is the
absolutely most stereotypical image that the average moviegoer who knows
nothing about 15th-century France or Joan of Arc or who has never thought
about spiritual things in a meaningful way will expect when he or she sits
down to watch this film?&quot;  And then, having done little thinking
themselves,
they filmed it.
