1999_November 15 

It was a tough day of movie watching.  I had just finished watching Dogma,
when I saw that The Messanger was playing as well.  So I decided to see
the
next showing... and while I enjoyed Dogma... The Messanger blew me away!
I
was completely and utterly moved by the performances of the entire cast.
To
watch her unhealthy (just my opinion) obsession with God bloom into full
blown insanity as an excuse to get revenge on for her sister's death was
one
of the most moving and disturbing experiences I've ever been privy too.  I
would recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of Joan of Arc history or
who just wants to see an interesting movie.  And I don't want to forget
the
incredible soundtrack as well.  It fit the movie like a glove.  Milla
Jovivich was in top form as Joan herself and played the role as though
born
for it.  So go see this movie and enjoy the wild ride.  Just hope that you
don't have nightmares for the poor Joan of Arc as I did after seeing the
movie.  It's that moving.   - Calculated X
