I gave this movie a 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Ever wanted to know what it feels like to be trapped in a bad dream? If you
like bad dreams then you will love this movie. And like most dreams, most of
it doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />I am a 24 year old male engineering and computer science student living in
SC. I do have a large humanities background.<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />This is a long movie, over two and a half hours I think. And in some ways it
is pleasing to watch... <br /><br />Your eyes will love this movie:<br /><br />There is a lot of dream imagery in this movie:<br /><br />Oh, look at her run through the field of green flowers, and now red flowers,
and now blue flowers, and now yellow flowers, and let's not forget the
purple flowers. <br /><br />How about some pretty clouds too? Yes, you get to see almost ten minutes of
cloud footage. Happy clouds, sad clouds, angry clouds... you name them this
movie has 'em. <br /><br />More eye-candy! Yes, there is blood, blood, and more blood. Even the maps
bleed in this movie. How many ways can you kill someone without modern
weapons? Answer: See this movie and you will know. Okay, okay, they might
have left one or two ways out but that is it. <br /><br />Slow motion! The movie wouldn't have nearly taken so long if it played at
full speed. But since half of it is a dream you have to watch that half in
sllooowwww motion...<br /><br />I must admit listening to everyone talk is fun. There is one warrior whose
voice is so impressive I want to give this movie a 7 instead of a 6. And
Joan's voice is good too.<br /><br />And that was the good part...<br /><br />Your brain will hate this movie:<br /><br />The movie gets a lot of things wrong by trying to do too much. In the end it
does a lot of things, but none of them. It builds up a way of looking at
something, only to turn around and tear it down. And again in the end there
isn't much left. Of her army or of the movie...<br /><br />It could have had a really cool King Arthur Knights of the Round Table kind
of story where the hero is the chosen instrument of God sent to set things
right and save the king and the country. Now wouldn't that have been nice
and worth seeing, but no... Amazingly nothing ever happens to the characters
you dislike. The manipulating step-mother keeps her son, the future king of
France under her thumb and that's that. Don't not like her too much cause
nothing is ever going to happen to her in this story. And it is definitely
not Cinderella. Not only is there no happy ending, but the ending doesn't
even make sense!<br /><br />Basically Joan is torn down by her countrymen, her enemies, and herself in
the end. Built-up and then torn-down. She's their hero one minute and then
she's just a heathen the next minute.<br /><br />There is a graphic murder-rape scene right from the start that makes the
movie a little hard to take. I have a bad opinion of movies that have rape
scenes, especially when you aren't sure why they have them. It's a little
too much of a sex scene for me. And if they want a sex scene they should
just have a sex scene.<br /><br />It really isn't a horrible movie. It just had some big problems. If I had it
to do over again I would have still watch it. It does have something to
offer. But I still wouldn't have liked the movie overall.<br /><br />Be sure to check out my other reviews.<br /><br />Thanks.
