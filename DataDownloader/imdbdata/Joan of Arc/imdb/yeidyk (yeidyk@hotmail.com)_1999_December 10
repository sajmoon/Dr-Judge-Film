This movie is great, a masterpiece. It really touched my heart and soul, i
cried like a little girl.  Milla Jovovich was great. Joan of Arc was such a
huge heroine. This movie is going to make you think a lot. About your past,
present and future. And please, if you can, buy the movie soundtrack, it's
wonderfull.
