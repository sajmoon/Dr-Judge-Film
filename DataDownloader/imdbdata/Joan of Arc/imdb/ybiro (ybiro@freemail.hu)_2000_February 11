<br /><br />I think the French film has always been the most powerful rival the American
film. The French make art films,commercial films, action films, adventure
films, romantic films, historic films cartoons etc. In 60s-80s years much
more films were made, and there were a lot of excellent directors and big
stars. 
In 90s almost only Luc Besson can direct such commercial films that are
successful in other countries in Europe or in North America. He has focused
on scenes, dynamic plotdriving but has showed the deep of soul and let the
audience think. at the same time (Think about Leon the pro, Grand Blue,
Subway). He has directed sci-fi, Fifth Element also of which has not had so
many fans as Star Wars has had, but in Europe, in Hungary for example, we
liked it. <br /><br />Now he decided to make a film about the darkest part of the French history.
Reviewers said that his approaching to the subject is different from the
previous ones. Luc Besson directed this film as a commercial filmdirector
would have done. He focused on the scenes of apparitions and the war. The
life (in her childhood her family were massacred by the British) and
religion explains why she wants to ask the expectant king for giving her
army, saying she will save the country. This Joan of Arc is self-confident
and shy at the same time. She has got not any experience how to lead an army
but she knows -she thinks-what God says. 
Of course the soldiers will not accept Jeanne D'Arc as general but because
of victories she will have more and more influence. But after the deciding
battle she is also horrified from the view of a lot of died men, blood,
limbs. Even the king betrays her when she is not needed. She will be
indecisive, frightened, even she will have to struggle herself conscience.
This conscience is a small boy at the beginning of the film then will be a
matured, adult man. This is the most interesting and impressed moment of the
film. Jeanne D'Arc asks her conscience about her religion, her truth, her
responsible. With her the viewer also attains to the total/complete
scepticism. <br /><br />But I am sad about this film. I feel insecure of Luc Besson. In his film
people speak English not French, which is sometimes fun or strange during
the film and big American actors are involved. I heard people in USA hate
the subtitles and they don't watch film in foreign language. Maybe Luc
Besson made this film for American.  He selected American actors. Dustin
Hoffman , Faye Dunaway, Jonn Malkovich who are brilliant in their roles. I
particularly impressed by Dustin Hoffman. With his beard he he has got
charisma, he is a really alive conscience. But it should have been  worth
selecting somebody American actress for role of Joan of Arc who would have
been more convincing, because Milla is not convincing for me, and I didn't
enjoy the film because of her. 
When Jeanne D'Arc (Joan of Arc) should have been determined, self-confident 
Milla is not so determined, convincing. She is not charismatic enough for
this role . As a Hungarian reviewer said Milla was good as the fifth element
but not as Jeanne D'Arc. But it would have been the best if Luc Besson would
have remained a hundred per cent French director. <br /><br />This film would have been very good. The scenes, the plot, the approaching
to the subject are interesting and understandable and captivate. But the
whole movie is not put together somehow. <br /><br />Now it is fashion that the successful directors, actors go to USA because
there are money there. They try to make a type of American films and lost
their identity. There are very few directors who are able to repeat the same
success what they had got before, in &quot;the Old World&quot;. Maybe Luc Besson will
come home to Europe, to France.
