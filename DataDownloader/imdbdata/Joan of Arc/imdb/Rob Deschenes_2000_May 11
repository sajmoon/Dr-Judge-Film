Well thought film detailing the life of Joan of Arc: a woman no one in
France really did not know how to take. After seeing her sister murdered
than raped, Joan grows up to become a messenger of God to the dauphin of
France. Meanwhile, France is getting pounded on left, center and right from
the English and Burgundians.<br /><br />Milla's portrayal of Joan was extremely strange, from one minute she was
whining, the next she was screaming and acting totally out of it: I guess
the result of hearing voices. Because of this, the French army are far more
enjoying to watch. The dry jokes, and the fun wit of the men seem to show
far more acting talent than Joan of Arc herself. Otherwise the film is
great, the battles are good, the conspiracy against Joan was even better.
When the dark, shady figure shows up, the movie is at its best as everything
Joan believed is literally laughed off. Good movie, should have got another
Joan.
