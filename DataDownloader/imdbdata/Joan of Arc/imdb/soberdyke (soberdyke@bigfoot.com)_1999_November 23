1999_November 23 

I was really hopeful about this movie when I saw the previews.  But the
film
itself was a disappointment.  Milla Jovavich, who I loved in &quot;Fifth
Element&quot;
flopped as Joan.  She simply did not have the strength to pull it off.
Instead, she looked more like a frightened, insane rabbit.  The script and
direction of this film was equally bad.  The historical inaccuracies were
absolutely atrocious!!<br /><br />Forget about seeing this film.  Instead, rent or buy A&amp;E's version &quot;Joan
of
Arc&quot;, starring Leelee Sobieski.  Now that's a Joan worth
loving!!!
