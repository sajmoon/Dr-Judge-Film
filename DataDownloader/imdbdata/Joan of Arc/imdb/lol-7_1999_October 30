1999_October 30 

A very 'different' movie, like the 5th element was. Basically this is a
fast-paced action movie that manages to comment on faith. I really like
Dustin Hoffman's bit, Malkovich's fine. The mandatory gory realism is there,
but the very good story, and fascinating ending, make it a great
watch.
