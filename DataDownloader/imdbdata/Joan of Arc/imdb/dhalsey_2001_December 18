I really do not care for this movie.  I understand that this is not a
documentary.  And I understand that directors and writers need some artist
leeway to make history into an interesting movie (i.e. &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Rob
Roy&quot;, &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;, etc.).  But why would you change a pious
shepherdess into a revengeful, bloodthirsty lunatic.  This is not a
complimentary look at one of France's national heroes.  Anybody who is
familiar with the story of Joan of Arc already knows that she was a
reluctant hero who did not want to take on the role of France's savior, but
gave in to her &quot;voices&quot;.  These are the facts gathered from different
sources, including her trial.  The movie has her wanting revenge and that
she was interpreting her &quot;voices&quot; the way she wanted to hear them.  If they
wanted to fundamentally change her THIS much, why not make this movie &quot;The
Messenger:  The Story of Jane of Bourges&quot;  a totally fictional character.
30 minutes in to the movie, I was looking forward to Joan getting cooked at
the stake.<br /><br />If this was a film about &quot;George Washington&quot;, and he were portrayed as
bloodthirsty lunatic who used the American Revolution for revenge against
British for murdering his brother, the director would be
shot.
