The settings, sets, and costumes of this well-intentioned film are great.
Also, the political intrigues and two-facedness that caused the tragic death
of Joan are presented thoroughly.<br /><br />However, the problems begin at the beginning with introductory text of the
historical backgrounds rolling up the screen in hard-to-read small gothic
type that moves so quickly that the audience can barely read the text, let
alone absorb it. <br /><br />Another problem is the casting. While Mille Jovovich can pass as a boy (Joan
in male's clothing) in some scenes, she is still not an actress of the depth
needed for this film to really work. She presents Joan's shifting
personalities in a set of stock responses ranging from manic to bland, but
she never gives us the soul of a girl who was able to make armies follow her
and a whole nation believe in her. I also found Dustin Hoffman as her
&quot;conscience&quot; a bit laughable, especially with the New York accent. This
would have worked in Ken Smith's satiric comedy DOGMA, but not here in a
serious setting. Ian McKellan could have done it, but not
Hoffman.<br /><br />At the end, we are left wondering whether Joan, as presented in the film,
was just a mad masochist or someone who was genuinely touched by
God.<br /><br />
