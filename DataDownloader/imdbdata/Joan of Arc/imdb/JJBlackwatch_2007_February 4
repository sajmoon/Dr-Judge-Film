2007_February 4 
Although in some circles of movie review, this film was destroyed and
torn apart limb from limb. There are key features which add to this
downfall, simply and plainly when directing or acting in period dramas
never ever use American accents they are like a plague sent from the
belly of hell. John Malkovich is a prime example, now I&#39;m not a
historian nor someone who claims to be, but surly someone realised that
his accent would be a laughing stock, how difficult would it be to
master a french one or even an English one NOT!!!!. Barring a few flaws
i have to say i did quite enjoy this film, acting was rusty at points
the battles were lack luster with about a handful of men for each army.
All in all id advise this film for a Saturday night for anyone who
likes blood,god and some English ass kicking.
