I saw this yesterday on tape and I must say it was incredible. I thoroughly
enjoyed the film, but if a person didn't adore Braveheart then by no means
is he going to like this one. This has almost everything Braveheart had but
although it won't reach the high step on which Braveheart resides (and will
reside), it sure is close. <br /><br />Having seen Milla Jovovich in the Fifth Element, I never thought she could
pull off a role like this but BOY she did, and I was left wondering who
could do it better than her! And I don't think anyone would have, because
her acting was, simply said, superb! The way she played the character, the
face expressions, the emotions, fear, passion, hatred, enthusiasm, awe, I
sure owe her an apology.<br /><br />Anyway, the scenery is fantastic, the other actors also did a great job, the
fights were incredible (a less-gore version of Saving Private Ryan combined
with all the awe and emotions of Braveheart). I bet it would have looked
amazing at the cinema.<br /><br />I also liked the focus on the inner thoughts and visions of Joan, e.g. when
near the end of the movie she is left wondering if it was for God, or for
her self she was making the war. The inner struggle within Joan is amazing,
the not-knowing-for-sure what she is doing and the I-am-waiting-for-a-sign-now
attitude was a pleasant addition to the character's development, and boy was
it worth it! Also, concerning the character, I thought it was a great move
in the beginning of the movie to delay the appearance of the adult Joan
(M.Jovovich). Shades here and there, a black cape on, to cover her by now
mysterious face and accentuate the anxiety of the viewer to see what has
become of the little girl Joan.<br /><br />Overall, although it hasn't made me weep like Braveheart had, it still holds
its ground steady, right below Braveheart, and it would take a hell of a
movie to pull this baby down from the 2nd place in epics. (Hmmm...I haven't
seen The Patriot yet. Who knows...)
