I really wanted to like this movie. The medieval battle scenes are well
done, well, until Milla shows up. She apparently spent many hours practicing
looking bug-eyed in a mirror, tilting her head back, and looking at the tip
of her nose. She's as unconvincing as Joan as conceivable. The movie wallows
in some ridiculous exploitative scenes, like the big too-doo over checking
to see if she's still a virgin. Puh-lease. And I didn't know that punk
hairdos were invented in the 14th century. Give this movie a pass unless you
really like medieval battle scenes - and just fast-forward over the rest
anyway.
