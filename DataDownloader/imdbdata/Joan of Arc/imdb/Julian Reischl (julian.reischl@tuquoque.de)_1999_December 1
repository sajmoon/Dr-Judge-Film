1999_December 1 

Hello, moviegoers!<br /><br />I deeply bow before Luc Besson's latest film, which is, in my humble
opinion, a masterpiece.<br /><br />When I saw it, I couldn't help noticing that the first part (until she gets
captured) seems like a medieval Indinana Jones adventure, with bits and
pieces of mystery and fun in it. But after Jeanne gets arrested, all her
experiences and all we have seen up to then, gets shown in a new light. Luc
Besson puts everything into a different perspective. And now the question is
left open: Is she a hero, a divine messenger or just schizophrenic? Well, I
think that this film is one of many possibilities to look at something that
has really happened (in contrary to the Blair Witch Project, which has
caused so many troubled minds lately), but the close circumstances are
unknown. We will never know the truth. So, stop complaining, you all (or at
least you many), and watch the story the way Luc Besson interpreted it. What
you think then is your business.
