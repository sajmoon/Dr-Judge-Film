Uhm well were to start. First of all the casting, if you're trying to make
an honest sincere story about Joan of Arc well try to cast the right actors
to do so. that means:
don't cast americans to act as french. try to cast some good actors in
stead
of well known ones.
the script: well i'm not totally sure on what Besson was trying to do here,
make a comedy or a drama. according to my standards he failed at both. I
mean when the french shoot a canonball at the english which says Hello, i
start wondering what the writers were on while coming up with this stuff.
Having a bunch of lunatics acting as Joan's henchmen doesn't really do
justice to the real story about this important character in European
history.
Milla Jovovich as Joan, i wonder whether Besson typecast her. Because if
you've seen her in the Fifth Element, you'll know what i mean. She acts as
if she just walked off that set.
the dialogue is absolutely horrific. With all the visuals and sets they try
to create this 15th century, and they sort of succeed. but whenever the
actors speak you know you're back in the present time. The actors use
ordinary slang instead of the dialect or even the words used in that time.<br /><br />no good words for this movie. a waste of money!
