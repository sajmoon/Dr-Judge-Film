2004_September 15 

I watched this pile of rubbish during a period of a couple of months
when I was on vacation, holed up with a friend and we would just rent a
couple of movies most nights and 'review' them. He was initially very
enthusiastic because it had several of his favourite actors in it. <br /><br />I think we managed to get through nearly an hour of it before the awful
dialogue, ridiculously contrived situations, excruciating political
correctness and general awfulness got the better of both of us and we
reached for the remote, sparing ourselves whatever further horrors may
have lurked in the latter portions of the movie. <br /><br />This is just overrated rubbish, with terrible lead acting, and an air
of revisionist self-importance, and some plain silliness thrown in for
good measure. I wish Jay Sherman had been around to review it. 3 out of
10.
