2000_December 3 

Truly one of the most moving and well done films I've seen in many years.
Luc Besson did a marvelous job at putting this film together from script to
edit. With a powerfully passionate performance by Milla Jojovich, The
Messenger whisks me away willingly each and every time I experience it.
Script, direction, cinematography, music, edit and performance are
masterfully sewn together seamlessly to enhance one another strongly. A
gather of qualities we fail to find often enough in films today.<br /><br />Milla portrayed Joan far better then any other actor I could imagine. Truly
her best performance to date. This to me, is the ability and passion every
actor should take note of. The intensity in her eyes, facial expressions
and
body language projected commanded and directed this story with, and the
lack
there of, any spoken word. Simply, this film moved me deeply.<br /><br />
