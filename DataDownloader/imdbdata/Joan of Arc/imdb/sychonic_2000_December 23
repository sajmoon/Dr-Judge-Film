This has some very interesting elements in it, it&#39;s kind of like a
merging of an intellectual existential study of faith, doubt, religion,
hypocrisy and God, and putting in an epic battle format. In some ways,
it seems appropriate to do it that way, since Joan of Arc seems to be a
very complex individual. <br /><br />I find it fascinating that this movie inspired so many people to share
their ideas about it, both positive and negative. Personally I found
this to be compelling, and one that reinforces the notion of faith
giving one strength.<br /><br />And the one thing that comes through about Joan is her enduring and
powerful faith in God. There are those who found it to be atheistic in
tone, I didn&#39;t see that. I saw a person of faith whose beliefs are
sorely tested, particularly in the face of death--and the realization
of abandonment by practical politicians. <br /><br />Milla J. hasn&#39;t had many parts where she actually needed to act, like
in the Fifth Element. But this one requires much of her, and all in
all, I think she did a credible job. <br /><br />This movie takes a little effort, and it&#39;s not a great one by any
stretch. But it if you give it a chance, it will make you think.
