1999_November 15 

This movie falls flat on nearly every level.  The main problem is in the
screenplay - dull dialogue, sloppy pacing, bad scene transitions, disjointed
comedy and drama segments and an overall sense of an unfinished script drag
the movie down below the merely mediocre film it could have
been.<br /><br />The acting ranges from awful to passable.  Other than the Dauphin, the
queen, Joan herself and Joan's &quot;conscience&quot;, there aren't any characters
worth mentioning, so the poor acting isn't that noticeable.  It's the
hysterics of Joan that will make you cringe, and John Malkovich lurches
around with a slackjawed air of surprise through the entire proceeding. 
Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman are OK, but the roles are far below both of
them.<br /><br />Besson chooses to show us this mangled epic in mostly closeup shots. 
There's no sense of grand scale when almost every scene is filmed so
tightly.<br /><br />Add to these flaws lots of cliches and needless decapitations.  There's also
a pretty disgusting rape scene (probably meant as a BIG IMPORTANT CHARACTER
BUILDING MOMENT, but it just comes across as distaseful.  Compare to the
rape scene in American History X and see how it's done
right.)<br /><br />By the end of hour two you'll be praying for the stake
yourself.
