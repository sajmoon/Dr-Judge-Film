Luc Besson was about to become one of my favorite film directors<br /><br />of all time before he came up with the mediocre 5th Element and<br /><br />this just plain awful Joan of Arc movie. My worst fear was that<br /><br />heroin chic in her late 20's supermodels wouldn't do good<br /><br />teenage virgins. My worst fears were problem true: Jovovich has<br /><br />to be the worst Joan yet, with most of her representation coming<br /><br />from the school of over-acting. She's screaming and bursting<br /><br />into tears in almost every line she uttered. Of course, the<br /><br />script didn't help her at all.<br /><br />The main problem in the script is the lack of character<br /><br />background and/or motivation. If there was any, it was too<br /><br />vague. Joan evolves from a screaming warrior, to a reluctant<br /><br />cheerleader, to a peace advocate, in minutes. You don't care for<br /><br />neither character, including the leading role, at any time<br /><br />during the movie. Actually this is the Joan of Arc movie where<br /><br />you can't wait for her to burn.<br /><br />I'm sorry about Luc's fans, but he should keep doing movies<br /><br />about French professional assassins rather than this. Earlier<br /><br />this year, a mediocre CBS mini series you could watch for free,<br /><br />beat this movie to a pulp.
