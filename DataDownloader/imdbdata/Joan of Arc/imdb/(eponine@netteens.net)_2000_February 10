What a wonderful movie.I think that's all what I do want to say.I love it
because Luc Besson has put a new interpretation of the story of Jeanne
d'Arc.Jeanne,in this film,is no long a saint nor is she a witch.She is
just
a simple girl.May be those scenes of war are not so good as those in
Braveheart and I do think that the real Jeanne was even braver and clever
that the  Luc Besson's.But the war is not the main theme of this
movie.
Luc Besson's aim is not to describe the history,or legend once again or
persuade us how brave and extraordinary Jeanne was.What he really wanted
to
state is &quot;Is She Really sent by God&quot;.And to criticize those who believed
that they are allowed to do anything even if it hurts others when they are
fighting for their ideals.See how Jeanne felt after she defeated the
English
army.She was lost and confused.See all the blood flooding and it is what
we
call &quot;victory&quot;!This is what we call &quot;glory&quot;!! How ironic!See the conflicts
between different reiligions and different countries or simply different
groups of people with different beliefs.People are so eager to destroy
everything.This is human nature.The wars in the film might not be better
that those in Braveheart but it carries a much deeper and more impressive
meaning than Braveheart.I think &quot;The Messenger&quot; is the best of all Luc
Besson's movie.I do think so and Milla Jovovich is wonderful.See how she
wince when facing the God.See her tears and hesitation.God,she is
brilliant.Her performance is really Oscar worthy.Dustin Hoffman acted
well,too.
