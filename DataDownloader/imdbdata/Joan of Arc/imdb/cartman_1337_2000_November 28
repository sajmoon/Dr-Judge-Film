I've got a lot of respect for the French heroine Joan of Arc, but didn't
know the whole story, so I wanted to see a Joan of Arc movie. Now I regret
seeing this version of the Joan of Arc story, rather than 'Joan of Arc', the
TV-movie from 1999 starring Leelee Sobiesky, or 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc'
from 1928. The only reason I chose this one was that it was directed by Luc
Besson, and that I've enjoyed all of his previous movies.<br /><br />But this movie is a sad chapter i Luc Besson's career. First of all it's
boring. Second; the acting is terrible, except for Dustin Hoffman's act.
Third; after seeing this film I completely lost the respect I had for Joan
of Arc. Milla Jovovich played her character in a way that made me feel that
the great heroine of war was nothing but a cocky, sissy peasant-girl with
illusions of grandeur. Quite frankly; I don't think that's the way a great
heroine should be characterized!<br /><br />After seeing this film on a DVD I sat down to see the HBO documentary
residing on the same DVD. Hearing Milla talk about all the research that
went into making this movie, that they visited many of the locations Joan
actually visited 500 years ago, and seeing original artifacts with Joan's
own handwriting and so on, was much more interesting than the movie
itself.<br /><br />Hoping to rebuild the respect a heroine like Joan of Arc deserve, I'll later
check out both of the films previously mentioned, since I've heard a lot of
good things about both those movies. It won't take much to beat this one,
but I hope that they're good enough to rebuild the respect deserved as
well!
