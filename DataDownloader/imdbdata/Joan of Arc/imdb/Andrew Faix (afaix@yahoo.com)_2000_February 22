2000_February 22 

I'm sure that like many fans of Besson's, I went into the theatre with
relatively high expectations for the Messenger.  I should have known
better.
Even from the previews (designed to excite those who are big fans of
historical epics), I should have gathered that he, a traditional action
film
director, was biting off more than he could chew.<br /><br />Oh, where to begin?  One of my bigger complaints of this monstrosity is
the
flagrant disregard for historical accuracy.  Of course, there were the
more
blatant instances of inaccurate portrayals of Joan's personal history, and
they've been addressed thoroughly in some of the other IMDB user views.  I
want to also point out the gross oversights in military history.  The
battle
scenes were terribly mis-represented;  specifically, the quality of some
of
the weapons and armor, and most particularly, the tactics.  Correct me if
I'm wrong, but they did have bows and arrows in the 15th century, right?
In
fact, weren't the English renowned for the proficiency with the longbow?
How many times were bow and arrow featured in the film?  Once, maybe
twice?
They seemed more interested spotlighting some ridiculous defensive
concepts
like the bowling-ball-shot-out-of-the-fortress-wall maneuver (it's beyond
me
how that technique could be effective more than once), and the &quot;porcupine&quot;
crossbow contraption.  Whoever was the technical / historical advisor on
this piece deserves to be subjected to one of these kludges.<br /><br />And how can I continue without berating the acting, or lack there of?
Milla
was HORRIBLE.  Apparently, Besson bargained that if he surrounded his wife
with experienced actors, and a high-budget production, that no one would
notice her very poor acting skills.  That certainly was not the case.
Everything wrong with this movie takes a back seat to the hideously poor
performance by Jovovoich.<br /><br />Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman, and all the rest of the cast
failed to rescue this abortion.  I was extremely disappointed in
Malkovich's
performance especially.  He didn't seem to know how his character should
be
portrayed.  Of course, the blame for this short-fall has to be shared with
the director.<br /><br />I also read in some of the reviews that Dustin Hoffman's performance
&quot;rescued&quot; the film.  Could someone point out where this occurred?  Where
was
the acting challenge in Hoffman's role?  You pretty much could have given
any yahoo with a beard a black cloak and a script and told him, &quot;Here,
read
these lines in a monotone voice.&quot;  You would have been left with the same
results.<br /><br />It's hard not to compare this atrocity to 1995's Braveheart, so I won't
bother trying to avoid it.  Obviously, Braveheart embodied the quality and
success that Besson was trying to achieve with the Messenger.  Had he
hired
Mel Gibson to produce, direct and play the lead roll of Joan of Arc, we
would have been treated to a much better picture.<br /><br />In the end, the audience was left with a hollowed out shell of an
historical
epic, with bad direction, a terrible script, poor acting, gross historical
inaccuracies, and gore for it's own sake.<br /><br />
