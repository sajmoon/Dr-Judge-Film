This is assuming that you know the Story of Joan of Arc<br /><br />At first while watching, the movie may seem a bit werid or even find
milla's
acting strange. But this movies has more than just action and history to
offer, it gives some interesting ideas on what may have happened. Why was
Joan of Arc so sucessful in uniting the french people. Why was she
labelled
a witch or even why she was so victorious in her battles. She might have
been sent by god. But if you know Joan of Arc story (before watching this
movie), you would know what happened in the end to her.....so you might be
asking...where was god at the end. Give it a go, try to see deeper into
the
movie, you might be seeing Joan of Arc in a new light
