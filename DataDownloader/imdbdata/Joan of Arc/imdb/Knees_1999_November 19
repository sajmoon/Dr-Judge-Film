1999_November 19 

I'll start with the good part. The supporting cast was excellent and keep
the movie moving during the early parts.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was subpar. Random acts of violence are thrown into
the movie with little or no reason other than to shock the audience.
Half-way through the movie the historical story stops and the directors
Benson and Birkin give in to their desire to have a never ending movie.
There are many scenes that I have been trying to forget since I watched the
movie. I'll summarize the last 60 or so minutes of movie in one sentence.
Joan goes insane and does it so effectively that the audience never
understands what her or the director's plot or focus is. I don't write
movies off completely that often, but this one is a definite one to tell
your friend to: SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WATCH AN OLD FAVORITE, THIS IS SURE TO
DISAPPOINT.
