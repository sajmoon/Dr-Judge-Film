This isn't another Braveheart nore was it intended to be. It is about an
average girl who witnesses something awful which changes her life forever.
This is yet another film to give us a visual about the worlds history. Joan
of Arc was just an average woman who did heroic things. Which is clearly
indicated in the film. Also during certain scenes she acts confused and in
the end she was really confused who wouldn't be, she didn't want all those
people to die but this was clouded by her thoughts in that she proclaimed
herself a messenger of God. In the end the viewer might think that she
wasn't which is possible but with her dreams that she had those were just to
vivid to pass off as chance. In my opinion she was a messenger, but one of
freedom for the French. While in Braveheart William Wallace knew exactly
what he was doing and what was needed to get done in order to free Scotland
unlike Joan who really got more confused as the movie progressed.<br /><br />Great visual effects, beautiful colors, and wonderfully mixed (sound wise.)
This is by date the best sounding DVD out there with an extraordinary
soundstage with excellent front to back imaging. A must reference DVD for
anybody. 5 out of 5!!!!!!!!!!
