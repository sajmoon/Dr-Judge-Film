1999_November 27 

When the 5th Element first came out, I was blown away by the excellent
directing qualities of Luc Besson, and the astounding acting of Milla
Jovovich. When I heard about a new Luc Besson movie, with Milla in it, I
raced to the movie theater. &quot;The Messenger&quot; has 4 times as much superb
content as The 5th Element, and has put a strong mark on my favorite movies
of all-time.
