On the pure basis of &quot;Was I entertained?&quot; I have to say I was. The movie
was
a decent watch that kept me interested. On that level The Messenger is a
good movie. The visual aspects along with the majority of the cast
certainly
helped this along. So it wasn't a horrible film. Taken as a story simply
and
not historical epic, it's fine.<br /><br />On the other hand, history it certainly is not. I apologize to all who
take
the &quot;we just can't know&quot; stance, but yeah, we can know a lot more than one
might think. There are records, evidence, artifacts, and documents that
when
combined and analyzed as a whole can provide us with a relatively accurate
idea of Jeanne D'Arc's life and times.<br /><br />For story purposes, portraying Jeanne as a borderline psychotic is a good
move. It adds some element of tension to the character and the events that
happen around her. To say that it presents a historically accurate picture
is pure balderdash. Jeanne was far more involved than just a visionary
battle-maven.<br /><br />I write this all to simply say, Those who say this is a horrible movie are
being far too critical. And those who say it's a great historical epic are
engaged in some wishful thinking. It's a good movie but not good
history.
