Besson has done some spectacular movies.  This is not one of<br /><br />them.  Milla's over-acting creates a character who is both annoying<br /><br />and difficult to believe.  None of the central characters are easy to<br /><br />empathize with so one doesn't really care if they live or die.  The<br /><br />violence seems unnecessary and gruesome.  The script is choppy<br /><br />and the dialog is forced.
