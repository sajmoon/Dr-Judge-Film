I was really expecting an amazing epic from Luc Besson. I think The
Professional is a classic, and The fifth Element is one of my favorite
sci fi movies. Yes, Besson did pull of some pretty good looking camera
work in some of the scenes. In fact the were parts that I though looked
simply amazing. Then there were scenes, such as some of the battle
scenes were it appeared to me that the soldiers were not really going
at it, but just play fighting. I was watching the soldiers fighting in
the back ground and it really did look like they were just going
through the motions of fighting like it was their first time
practicing, until the camera suddenly cut to a close up and someone's
leg gets chopped off. The battles were also quite confusing since I
never really knew who was the french and who was the English. I didn't
know who was kicking who's a$$ until it was over and someone cried &quot;WE
WON!&quot; I didn't feel that there was any real deep character development,
either. The dialogue was maybe a little too modern also, including the
accents. It seemed that there was little effort to give the dialogue
any historical value. The movie did have it glorious moments but for me
personally there was just a lot missing the should of been there for a
movie like that.
