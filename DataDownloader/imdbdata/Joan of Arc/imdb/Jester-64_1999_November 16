1999_November 16 

I know that it stayed true to history, but come on. I would have been
much
happier had they cast a different person in the role of Joan, any part of
the movie where she spoke was horrible. I honestly thought that this was
Malkovich's worst role. But I loved the actors in the parts of the main
French army officers.  And Dustin Hoffman, man, he was awesome! I loved
his
parts.  The beggining and ending were lacking but it picked up towards the
end.
