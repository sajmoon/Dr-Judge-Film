In my opinion, it is a blessing to have a writer/director such as Luc
Besson
in the industry.  This movie, &quot;The Messenger Joan of Arc,&quot; is simply one
of
my favorites, with great performances from Milla Jovovich (one of my
favorite actresses and I'm still doubting whether I spelled the name
correctly or not!)  I feel this is excellent, as well as educational, for
I
never would have known as much as I know about Joan of Arc if I had not
watched this film.  I can't wait for Luc to come out with some more movies
that I just may be able to catch in theaters!  Thanks for reading my
response and have a great year.
