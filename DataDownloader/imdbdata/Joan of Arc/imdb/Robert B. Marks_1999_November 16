1999_November 16 

This is a film that could, and should, have been an Oscar contender.  A
modern big-screen adaptation of the story of Joan of Arc has the potential
to blow even Braveheart out of the water.  This one, however, won't manage
it.<br /><br />There are certainly some strong performances, including by Milla Jovovich,
who does have the presence to play the part.  Unfortunately, while she plays
it with presence, she also plays it wrong.  Her Joan of Arc is so twitchy
that it is almost impossible to believe that anybody would even think she
could merit an audience with the Dauphin, much less command an
army.<br /><br />The largest problem lies with the storytelling itself.  The first hour and
forty-five minutes has gaping holes in the narrative and it is difficult to
see how the characters portrayed get from point A to point B.  Once Joan is
captured the narrative finally flows smoothly, but the end result feels as
though the film was originally at least an hour longer and it was cut in the
most artistic manner possible.  They should have left it in; this film is at
least an hour too short to tell the story.<br /><br />Final mark: 3.5/5.
