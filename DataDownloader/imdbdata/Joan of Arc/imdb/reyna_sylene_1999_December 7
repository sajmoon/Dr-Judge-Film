1999_December 7 

I enjoyed The Messenger very much. I thought that its ruthlessness &amp;
sincerity was refreshing. There are so many mindless movies being made
today
simply for profit. I think that this movie stays true to the art of film
making instead of money making. I think Milla Jovovich did an an
extraordinary job as Jeanne. Personally, I don't think that there is anyone
in Hollywood that could have done the part better. I'm usually not as
affected by other movies as I was by this one. The Messenger made me want
to
find the person who thought up war in the first place &amp; rub his nose in it
the way you would to a bad puppy who has just messed up your carpet. This
movie invoked an array of different emotions I didn't know where there. I
would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie
worth their time &amp; money.
