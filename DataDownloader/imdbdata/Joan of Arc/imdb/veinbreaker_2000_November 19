apart from a nice performance by HOFFMAN this movie sucked. It sucked in the
sense that it had a great cast but didn't have the right juice to lift it
up. I am shocked that legendary LUC BESSON directed this cause his films
always rock. This film is a waste and the wisecracks in it and stupid
laughing in the face of danger made it unbearable.
