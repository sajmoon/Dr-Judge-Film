Joan of Arc the legend which was described as saint, warrior, frantic,
heretic etc. is brilliantly played by Milla Jovovich. This movie isn't
the typical hero stuff you would expect. It has many sides to think of
and gives you space to make your own thoughts about the character Joan
of Arc. And that is exactly what I liked the most about the movie. You
can almost feel what this very young woman must have felt to be on the
battlefield at this age, fighting for her vision, faith or whatever it
was. Intoxicated by the battles and her mission to fight the war for
god, for France. <br /><br />Besides from that you will see a lot of battles. Great visuals and good
to memorable acting.<br /><br />Most people seem to get the movie wrong. They probably wanted a clean
hero saga or some documentary movie, I don't know. This movie is
something different. Sometimes you have to read between the lines, make
your own thoughts. But as I said, that's what I like and that's what I
want from a good movie.<br /><br />10/10
