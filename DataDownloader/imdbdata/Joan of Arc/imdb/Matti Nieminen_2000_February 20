I have seen this movie twice, and i could watch it ten times more. Ignore
the critics who only tries to find the faults in everything they see. This
movie is a great mix of history and most of all; entertainment, which is by
the way, the reason why we all go to the movies, except the critics. When
great masters like Besson makes a movie, they know that there are always
people who doesn't like it, in this case they are the critics. If you are
even a little bit interested of history and you like drama/&quot;action&quot; movies,
then you definitely should see this. A MASTERPIECE!!
Please ignore the grammatical errors.
