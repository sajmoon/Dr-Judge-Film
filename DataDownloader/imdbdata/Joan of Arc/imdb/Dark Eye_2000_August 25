A movie that dares to challenge what its trying to represent always makes
the best viewing experience, because it radiates intelligence.  Luc Besson
has the courage to do just this in The Messenger.<br /><br />Other movie versions usually represent Joan as nothing more than a
2-dimensional character who seems to tremble with awe at the very sight of a
bible.  We can't see the deeper emotions that Joan felt for her people
simply because most movies depict her as a demure, delicate heroine.  Luc
Besson managed to made his Joan more 3-dimensional, and as the result she
becomes more human and edgy.  Only in this version can we see how angry and
upset Joan is on how the English treated her people.<br /><br />This movie will definitely annoy those who are religious and held Joan D'Arc
in the highest esteem.  By questioning Joan's heavenly motivations is like
commiting a travesty.  But there are already other dozens of movies about
her, therefore it would be silly for a director to remake a movie which is
just like the ones before!<br /><br />Joan D'Arc was definitely a heroine who fought for the freedom of France. 
But was her intention really divine, or was it really something else?  When
this question was raised, the story became more interesting, because it
started to challenge the viewer's minds.  At the end it doesn't matter how
her intention came about, because she is still one cool chick who inspired
France to liberate themselves.  A champion of freedom.  Isn't that what Joan
D'Arc is supposedly all about?  Or have we forgotten that in the thick midst
of religious dogma?
