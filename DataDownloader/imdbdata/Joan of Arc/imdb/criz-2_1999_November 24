1999_November 24 

Easily one of the biggest surprises of 1999, &quot;The Messenger&quot; (gasp!)
actually turns out to be a well-crafted film. Suffering from tremendous
abuse heaped on it--by the same so-called experts who thought &quot;Shakespeare
in Love&quot; was the best picture of 1998--it is perhaps the most misjudged film
in a long time.
But then again, most cinema goers aren't the sage souls you and I are. And
most actresses couldn't carry off a masterful performance the way Little
Cosmetics Girl Milla Jovovich did.
The girl can act! Who woulda thunk it? 
But the director's ex does her old old man right--this is one of the best
performances by any lead, female or male, this year. 
Milla manages to be both captivating, admirable and alluring--adding just
the right tinge of tragedy to Joan of Arc's martyrdom without coming across
as holier-than-thou, and at the same time Jovo exudes natural confidence and
sexuality that had every male in the theatre squirming in his seat. (I'm a
guy, I should know.)
In addition--oh, I almost forgot, there actually were OTHER actors in this
movie--command performances are given by John Malkovich and Tcheky Karyo
(Kelly Preston's smarmy dream man in &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;)
Please, PLEASE go see this movie. (No I do not have a percentage deal. I
just care about good cinema, and if everyone goes to see this film more of
its calibre will be made.) If you consider yourself any kind of a cinema
lover, you will.
