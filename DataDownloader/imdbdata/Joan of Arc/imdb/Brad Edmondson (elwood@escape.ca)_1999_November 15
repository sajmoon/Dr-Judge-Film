There a a few strengths to this film that are overshadowed by many
weaknesses.  For one, Mila Jovovich gives an excellent performance.  She
portrays a manic, self possessed and self righteous woman acting out the
will of a higher power she nonetheless makes Joan an interesting character
to watch and empathize with.  Luc Besson delivers with his excellent
cinematics and camera work.  Between his direction and Mila's performance
this is a truly beautiful film.<br /><br />However, the dialogue for nearly everyone except for Mila and Dustin Hoffman
is very flat.  At times the dialogue is full of modern anachronisms that are
very distracting and cheapen the whole ambiance of the film.  It seemed as
if the film was trying to be hip while portraying an important historic
drama.  There are too many examples of this to quote here, but suffice it to
say that poor dialogue ruined an otherwise good film.<br /><br />See the Messenger for Mila, see it for good direction in film, but be
prepared to groan when the talking starts.<br /><br />6 out of 10.
