I know next to nothing about the Joan of Arc story, but I&#x27;ve liked Luc
Besson&#x27;s work, and the trailer was terrific, so I was looking forward
to this movie, even after the bad reviews. As might be expected from a
Besson film, it looked incredible. The battle scenes were all
well-handled, and as the warrior Joan, Jovovich was quite convincing.
The rest of the movie was something else again.<br /><br />It seems to me Besson and his co-writer, Andrew Birkin, were trying to
do what Kenneth Branagh did in his version of HAMLET; look at the lead
character not as an icon, but as a normal human being, and try to
explain their actions and behavior in that context. Admittedly, since I
am unfamiliar with this story, I am more receptive to this approach
than those who hold Joan as an icon, but I would have been more than
willing to watch a movie which handled this material well.
Unfortunately, once Besson established which way he wanted to go, he
seemed unsure of how to get there. Most of the drama is handled on a
third-grade level(especially her trial), and we never really get into
what made Joan tick. Though the scenes with Dustin Hoffman were
involving, especially since he was so good, they too fell short in
explaining Joan. And Jovovich can&#x27;t quite access those depths yet.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is okay. Malkovich and Faye Dunaway are playing
types, but they play them well enough. Tchecky Kayro(I know I&#x27;m not
spelling that right) and Vincent Cassel lend a sense of gravity to
their roles as soldiers. But all in all, this is a movie whose reach
was beyond its grasp.
