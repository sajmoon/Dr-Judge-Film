Whatever impact this movie might have had was ruined by the uninteresting
and boring script. Same old story with new actors, most of whom are unable
to play their roles. Jovovitch (Joan of Arc) pants and grunts heavily every
time she rides a horse, and seems to be unable to talk most of the time
(probably trying to express some strong emotions, but mostly making the
listener tune out before the second word). Whatever Dustin Hoffman did in
this film will never be explained. The final scenes with him explaining some
things that happened earlier are the best this movie offers (gave me a
laugh), but its not enough.
