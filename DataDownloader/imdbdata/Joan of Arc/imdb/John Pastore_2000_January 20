Milla Jovovich's intense performance had one wonder if she was in fact
overacting or being misdirected.
 
My latest conclusion was neither: the shooting script and direction were
simply not up to her exhibited capabilities while too much of the French
soldiery, and what has become the overrated casting of the Delphin, were
simply not up to the par she set.
 
The director's attention seemed hopelessly caught between making the
extraordinary story of Jean D'Arc a serious subject, while underestimating
Jovovich's overwhelming enthusiasm, and attempting to equal or surpass the
court and field intrigues of &quot;Braveheart,&quot; while also overestimating both
the supporting script and its casting: both of which lacked the cohesive,
and even fundamental, understanding for a treated subject that, in turn, can
only yield the ironic nuances, and deliveries, expected of what had
obviously been strived for: a best of the genre.
 
The premise of the script itself suffered irrevocably when finally laid bare
despite the final, and even straining, performances between Jovovich and
Hoffman to save it.
 
The inconsistencies made inherent, and thus transitions (or better said:
lack of transitions): from the heartily skeptical and defiant, and, for the
most part, unconvincing French soldiery to the sudden declaration of
allegiance to Jean by its toughest member, from the ardently Catholic, and
even prescient, Jean before her Inquisition to a Protestant, and no longer
prescient, Joan during her Inquisition, from the Burgundian Inquisitor who
would defy the English for &quot;Mother Church&quot; by promising confession to
nevertheless deny confession -when even, at the end' there was nothing to
loose- and, still, from there to, then and only lastly, make subordinant the
concept of the confession of possible truth to a priest-confessor to,
ultimately, a confession of irrevocable skepticism to, supposedly, only
individual conscience or even godhead -the very antithesis of the concept of
the sainthood the film's closing would nevertheless celebrate, and which
Jean D'Arc was, to the contrary, canonized, all marks the script, and its
premise, as subject material which was not only profoundly beyond its
authors' capabilities to conceive, but also material which they would,
nevertheless, make instrument to, as recent films seem to be making vogue,
an evangelism for a modernly self-serving fundamentalism which not only
simply did not then exist, but is also so uniquely conflictive, as was the
resulting film, as only present-day fundamentalism can only contrive.<br /><br />Though, at times, over compensating for the lack of script, Jovovich, I
think, will be remembered best for, nevertheless, not having underestimated
herself, while the film's director will be, I'm afraid, at best remembered
for having over compensated his film for his having grossly overestimated
its having a script -and, perhaps most of all, for having overestimated
himself when having accepted it. -John Pastore
