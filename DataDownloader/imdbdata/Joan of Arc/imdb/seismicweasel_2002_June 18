This is a brilliant film.  It is well acted, well scripted and well
directed.<br /><br />There is some very dark humour in this film but most people will not even
notice it.  This is not a genuine retelling of the story of Joan of Arc,
if
you're looking for the true story of her life, read a book or 5.  This
film
won't help you at all.<br /><br />But if you want to see a film that tries to reevaluate the story of her
life
and the traumas that made Joan of Arc into the teenaged girl who led the
French army against the English, then this film is great.
