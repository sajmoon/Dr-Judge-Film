2000_August 5 

From what I had heard prior to renting this movie, I figured that I would be
in for a decent, though liberally violent interpretation of Jeanne d'Arc
with historical accuracy that would outweigh most, if not all, of its
negative aspects.  But what can I say, other than that people don't
recognize garbage no matter how far down their throats it is
shoved?<br /><br />For this movie to receive any praise at all is ludicrous in itself. 
Certainly, it could be an interesting prospect to examine the life of a
supposedly-schizophrenic national figure with more negative connotations
than positive, but how far is it necessary to go to portray Besson's notion
that Jeanne d'Arc may not have been as holy as she has been said to be?  How
necessary is it to continually emphasize total pharisaism as opposed to mere
pride?  How necessary is it to portray Jeanne's visions as downright
satanic, and dispense of the saints which had supposedly spoken to her?  And
how necessary is it to portray her as a raving psychopath?<br /><br />If one is going to argue for historical accuracy, then perhaps they should
keep something in mind: simply because somebody engages in a battle which in
actuality took place, it does not make for accuracy;  the same goes for an
individual performing a certain action, or any other occurring event.  In
fact, this movie appears to guise itself under &quot;historical accuracy,&quot; while
it fails to explain any of the events that are taking place at the time. 
Yes, we know that France is divided and that the English are attempting to
take over, but are we ever introduced to any of the political intricacies or
other matters that Jeanne partook in other than those on the battle field? 
Anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that Jeanne d'Arc's story
is not one of war.<br /><br />In addition, there is lewd and tasteless humor interspersed throughout the
entirety of this movie.  Obviously, it was not enough to view the life of
Jeanne d'Arc through the eyes of a cynic, but through the eyes of a
perverse, teenage-minded director as well.  If you're looking for a modern
film on Joan of Arc, do yourself a favor and take a look at the TV movie
starring Leelee Sobieski.  Despite the fact that it is not historically
accurate, it is far more intellectual and entertaining than &quot;The Messenger&quot;
will ever be.
