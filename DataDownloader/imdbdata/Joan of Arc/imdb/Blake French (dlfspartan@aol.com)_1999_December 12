Romeo and Juliet&quot; re-released in 1996. However, one of the greatest
tragedies ever told, the story of Joan of Arc, has just been proven possible
to be relateable even with time as its enemy. Luc Besson has created a
fresh-feeling new version of Joan called &quot;The Messenger,&quot; a historical epic
that, for better or worse, concentrates mostly on visual style and realistic
war scenes rather than answering questions we don't already know about the
characters in focus here. <br /><br />	The historical Joan of Arc was a poor young French woman, who believed that
there were spiritual signs that ordered her to be a messenger to aid the
King of France to victory on the battle field. According to &quot;The Messenger:
The Story of Joan of Arc,&quot; Charles VII, married to the bitter Yolande
D'Aragon, was very grateful of her assistance at the time, especially when
Joan explained that God has sent her to lead French troops to war with the
English and be victorious. <br /><br />	The visions seen (or imagined) by Joan are clearly brought to life here,
with more effective qualities than ever before in a Joan of Arc picture.
They are filmed with many unusual special effects, bizarre camera tricks,
and a beautifully crafted atmosphere of imagery. In use with these elements
to the credit of the depicted scenes, they do a good job of expressing the
spiritual dream-like moments through Joan with an imaginative feeling of
majesty and revealing emotion. The style, camera, and direction all
contribute to making these sequences of the best material in the production.<br /><br />	The film was shot in the Czech Republic, as well as the country of France.
Cinematographer Thierry Arbogast captures the courageous historical time
period flawlessly in these locations. The battle scenes may get little off
track at times; some sequences are meant more for brutality purposes rather
than a strong, focused narrative story. <br /><br />	The actors interpret their characters with a precise energetic edge. Milla
Jovovich has the ability to be a believable Joan of Arc, but does push the
limit on convincing us. Some of the film's efforts are straining toward the
idea that Joan was somewhat mentally retarded-and Jovovich does a great job
presenting that. Other familiar faces found in &quot;The Messenger: The Story of
Joan of Arc&quot; include John Malkovich as King Charles VII, and Faye Dunaway as
his spouse, Yolande D'Aragon. Also the legendary Dustin Hoffman inhabits a
brief but appropriate role as the Grand Inquisitor, and Pascal Greggory is
The Duke of Alen&ccedil;on.<br /><br />	There are scenes in this movie that make the audience stare at the screen
in awe, but also scenes that make us ask ourselves questions. Although much
of the production is spent on developing Joan's character and motives, the
film still doesn't manage to answer some questions being asked by viewers
pondering minds. We never learn if the visions Joan experienced were a
calling from God, or just a figment of her intellectual imagination. Was
Joan really crazy, or only near eccentric? Were the physical objects that
Joan felt were signs from a higher spirit actually what she thought they
were?  An ulterior source could have been Lucifer deceiving the trusting
Joan. Or did the French actually triumph in battles because of the spiritual
strength accorded by Joan, or was luck the element present?  And I
personally would have like a little more explanation of the Grand Inquisitor
character. <br /><br />&quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc&quot; is a serious dramatic tragedy, and
it takes itself as that all of the time. Luc Besson has constructed a movie
that is ambitious and inspiring, with no room for the compromising or
modest. I recommend the picture weather you're a new comer or a veteran to
the Joan of Arc mythology.  Even if you already know the story of Joan of
Arc like the back of your hand, this telling might just surprise
you.<br /><br />Brought to you by Columbia Pictures.
