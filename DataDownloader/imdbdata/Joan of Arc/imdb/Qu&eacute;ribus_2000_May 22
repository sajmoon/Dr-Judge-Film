The most interesting in this movie is the particular version of this time
of french history.The national propaganda showed the story of Joan of Arc
as
a ridiculous legend (patriotism, god,etc) .As nobody really know what
happened this version is realist .This poor girl was certainly crazy and
utilized. Charles VII/Malkovich is fantastic (we're not far from
Machiavel).The battle scenes seems to be realistic too .I enjoy
particularly
Vincent Cassel (as Gilles de Rais which will become a kid's killer) when he
strikes with his fl&eacute;au.
