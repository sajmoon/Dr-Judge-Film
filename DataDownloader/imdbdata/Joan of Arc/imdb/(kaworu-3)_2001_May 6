This is, perhaps, the worst telling of the life of the Joan of Arc to ever
be placed on celluloid.  <br /><br />What makes this such a bad film?<br /><br />For starters, Milla Jovovich's portrayal of the Joan of Arc herself is much
more if a caricature than anything else, and a purely annoying caricature at
that.  She plays the role with a completely one-dimensional fanatical gusto
that is sometimes comical, but is more often grating.<br /><br />Second is the direction and the screenplay.  The first few minutes start off
looking like something that would not be out of place in &quot;The Sound of
Music&quot;.  Then the graphic violence comes in, and then there is the very
out-of-place moments of comic relief, and so on and so on.  This film jumps
between these three categories and more so unevenly that it feels as if it
has no direction at all.<br /><br />And the comic relief mentioned above?  I found the scene (near the
beginning) where a woman is killed and THEN raped to be disgusting enough,
but the way that it was played for laughs was tasteless beyond words.  I'm
no prude (I actually did find some redeeming values in &quot;Salo&quot;, actually),
but that scene was just plain sick.<br /><br />All in all, this was one of the rare moments when I was watching a movie
that I actually started to find myself growing increasingly impatient to see
the conclusion.  I actually started to want to see Joan of Arc being burned
at the stake, because that would mark the end of the movie, and my suffering
through this terrible piece of cinema would finally be
finished.<br /><br />If you must see a Joan of Arc movie, see Carl Dreyer's silent masterpiece
&quot;The Passion of the Joan of Arc&quot;, and accept no substitute.  But avoid this
version at all costs.
