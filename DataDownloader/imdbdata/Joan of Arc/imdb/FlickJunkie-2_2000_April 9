This is a rather irreverent and disturbing look at the life of Saint Joan of
Arc.  The portrayal of her early life was very good, giving her a sincerity
and piety that made the child Joan an attractive character.  However, once
Milla Jovovich took over as the teen Joan, she became a raving lunatic. 
Clearly, this was no accident.  She and director Luc Besson are husband and
wife, and it is obvious that this is their combined interpretation of
Joan.<br /><br />The problem with this portrayal was that Joan was made to be appear so
demented that she lost credibility as a believable character.  Her belief in
her voices was depicted more as mad fanaticism than unshakeable faith. 
Personally, I have no problem with this interpretation, since I am more apt
to believe her voices were the result of an unbalanced psyche than the voice
of God.  The problem I have is believing that anyone, even in the 15th
century, would give an army to someone who is so obviously over the edge. 
Moreover, it is a stretch to believe that even the most desperate of simple
minded men would follow such a character into battle.<br /><br />If the portrayal were just a little more balanced, with moments of piety,
sincerity and lucidity, the viewer and the other characters around her might
be justified in saying, `Is she divinely inspired or simply mad?'  Only when
that question resonates has Joan been portrayed effectively.  In this
interpretation there was never any question.  She was clearly a madwoman. 
It was almost a relief when they finally did away with
her.<br /><br />That being said, I must say that from a technical standpoint this was a
brilliantly directed film.  Luc Besson has produced a compelling visual work
of art.  The opening scenes of young Joan running through the fields were
exquisite.  The battle carnage was authentically grisly and the action
realistic.  The costumes were wonderful and the locations and sets well
chosen and well crafted.  His camera perspectives gave great impact to every
scene.  His imagary of supernatural events was electrifying.  In every
regard, other than Joan's character interpretation, this was an inspired
work.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich gave a superb performance as Joan The Mad.  Though I don't
agree with the interpretation, I can't imagine such insanity delivered any
more effectively.  She really seemed well suited for a jacket with wrap
around sleeves.  In every scene she exuded white hot intensity, especially
in the battle scenes.  Her performance was truly tour de
force.<br /><br />Faye Dunaway was fabulous as the cunning Yolande D'Aragon.  She was so
nefarious and in control, deliciously evil and conniving.<br /><br />John Malkovich did an excellent job portraying Charles VII, however he was a
bit old for the part.  Charles was born in 1403 and met Joan in 1429 at the
tender age of 26.  Malkovich has trouble passing for 46 (his actual age) no
less 26.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman's minor role as the conscience was also quite well done. 
Unfortunately, it lost some effectiveness because he was never really put in
context.  Was he another of Joan's creations or an actual being?  A little
defining dialogue would have helped develop his character better.<br /><br />This is a fine film with a fatal flaw.  If the story is to work, Joan must
be a beloved heroine.  In this portrayal, she does not endear herself to the
viewer.  Contrarily, she is a disturbing and off-putting character.  For
this reason I rated it a 7/10, though it easily qualified as a filmmaking 9
or 10.
