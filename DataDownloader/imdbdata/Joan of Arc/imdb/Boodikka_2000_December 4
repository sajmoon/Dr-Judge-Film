Well, Besson certainly blew this one, n'est ce-pas? This might have been an
interesting film, but the casting of the lead in such a film is important,
and Jojovic couldn't act at gunpoint. It definitely needed serious editing,
especially in the first 1/2 hour. I still don't get Besson's take on Jeanne:
was she a visionary or in need of Prozac? It would have been nice to see a
follow-up on Vincent Cassel's Gilles de Rais character: he went on to become
(allegedly) one of history's worst mass murderers.
