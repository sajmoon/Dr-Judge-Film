1999_December 11 

This isn't the best film of Luc Besson, but if you watch it in the right
frame of mind, it's not as bad as everyone says, and certainly worth a
viewing.  Try not to think of it so much as a Joan of Arc film, but as kind
of The Fifth Element or La Femme Nikita with a medieval setting (I know that
sounds strange, but it's the best analogy I can think of).  By watching Luc
Besson's previous films, I can see why he would be interested in Joan of
Arc's story.  I'm surprised (and to an extent, glad) that the people in
charge let Besson make this film, I would've though they would want a
&quot;safer&quot; director.<br /><br />Some parts of the film are downright cheesy, like Joan's visions and the use
of modern slang, but if you decide not to take it too seriously, you'll
enjoy it a lot more.  A lot of the battle scenes have very over-the-top
cartoonish quality, almost like something you'd expect from Sam Raimi or
someone like that that, and I enjoyed that.  I was a bit worried when I
first heard Milla Jovovich was playing the main role, but she does a better
job with it than I expected.  John Malkovich struck me as a rather odd
choice for the Dauphin of France, who I believe was supposed to be in his
20s.  Watch for Tcheky Karyo from Besson's previous La Femme Nikita in a
small role.<br /><br />This film is flawed to be sure, but if you watch it in the right frame of
mind, it's a piece of good, cheesy entertainment.  Not as good as Luc
Besson's classics of the past, but it will still be of interest to anyone
interested his films.  I'll probably get the DVD when it's
released.
