1999_November 9 

I was wondering this several times while watching the movie.  Basically I
spent 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this junk.
The Joan of Arc story should be told respectfully, without use of silly
profanity (did the English really utter the &quot;F&quot; word so many times?),
senseless gore and of course the necrophilia sequence.  Milla Jovovich acted
more like a cheerleader than a Messenger of God.  Dustin Hoffman's
appearance at the end saves the movie from being an utter travesty (also
John Malkovich's sly performance, complete with a slight reference to his
current movie Being John Malkovich!)  The acting by the others was laughable
at best (did I actually hear a character say &quot;whatever?&quot;)  This is being
touted by its studio as the next Braveheart.  Mel Gibson has nothing to
worry about.
