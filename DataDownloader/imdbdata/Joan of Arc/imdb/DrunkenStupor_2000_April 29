Obviously everyone knows that Joan was set up in the end and burned for
wearing men's clothing.<br /><br />After two hours of her running around, screaming, crying, and acting the
idiot, I was looking forward to her being betrayed and burnt.  Sounds bad,
but it's true.  I would think that if she was given charge of an army of
men
at the age of 16, she would have been a little more strong willed. I found
myself being pulled from a great respect for one of the most influential
and
amazing women, to a true detest for this blubbering child wailing like an
imbecile.  One of the scenes, (the first fight of Orl&eacute;ans), she just sat
on
her warhorse, wailing and spinning about as everyone fought.<br /><br />I truly am not this cynical about everything, just was really disappointed
after hearing so much about this movie.
