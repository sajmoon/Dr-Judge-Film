Luc Besson directs and Milla Jovovich stars as the Maid Of Orleans who
lifted France of its knees-and was tried and executed for being a
heretic. The End.<br /><br />Well that&#x27;s what you would think all Besson&#x27;s film amounts too, given
the hate and general negativity that pours down on it from many of the
worlds cinematic sources. Well, look, it&#x27;s not brilliant, but is it
really the devil that many have painted it as? Not so say I. It&#x27;s about
as subtle as a sledgehammer all told, but Besson&#x27;s study of the
iconic/infamous waif who did indeed expel the British hoards has gusto
by the shed load. He nicely crafts the 15th century lands from which to
tell his story, and then, to quote someone from another period epic,
unleashes hell. Literally. Yep the British armies are stereotypically
vile {I bet Mel Gibson loves the Brit portrayals here}, and the blood
that is shed is vicious and borderline sick. But it works well in the
context of Jeanne&#x27;s prominent rise and subsequent fall, with her
religious confliction deftly blending in with the blood being shed in
the pursuit of liberation. Visually the film is a treat, and for action
construction it holds up to be one of the better modern day historical
epics in that department. But where&#x27;s the substance?<br /><br />Ah, there&#x27;s the big problem with the movie. Besson and his co-writer
Andrew Birkin are so pre-occupied with the horrors of war and Jeanne&#x27;s
leadership qualities, they turn the rest of the film into a skeleton in
need of flesh. And it&#x27;s actually Jovovich who suffers the most. She&#x27;s
great when she&#x27;s screaming and launching into the enemy, taking an
arrow hit with grace and dedication . But there&#x27;s been no character
depth laid out, so Jovovich&#x27;s Jeanne just comes across as a moody
teenager out to cause trouble. We need to have some insight into her
troubled predicament and what drives her on, not the scantily written
filler moments that actually are just appetisers to blood letting
battles. There &#x27;s also annoyances when the film slips into moments of
modern day speak, it&#x27;s a crass and lazy oversight by the makers to
think that we wouldn&#x27;t notice such speak in 15th Century France. Besson
surrounds Jovovich with some fine acting talent tho, even if some are a
tad underused. Rolling out are John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman, Faye
Dunaway, Vincent Cassel, Timothy West, Desmond Harrington and the
always watchable, and scary, Tcheky Karyo.<br /><br />So a bit hollow it be, but on the outside it&#x27;s a ripper. Visceral,
explosive and yes, fun too. 7/10
