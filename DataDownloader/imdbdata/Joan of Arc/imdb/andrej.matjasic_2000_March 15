I've seen this film once and I decided to see it at least once again and to
obtain the DVD when available. Enough said?
I found the movie really very good and &quot;deep&quot;. It makes you think! A lot of
thinking... I am already amazed by the
(hi)story of Joan of Arc, which of course is unique and extraordinary. And
the film represents the major part of the main facts about her life,
character, acts, etc., about mysteries, about people's thinking, feelings,
believes... A strong presence of some special force, a connection to God
could be felt...
The music and sound effects are also great.
Ok - the whole crew did an outstanding job. And especially Milla Jovovich
was amazing. I think this is one of her best roles. To conclude: for me: a
great experience and a truly good film!
