I would like to say that this movie was excellent. Maybe I am not the
right
person to judge this as I am a fan of Luc Besson and Milla Jovovich. If
the
setting is historical drama/war then so much better.<br /><br />I have not really seen any other movies about Jeanne d'Arc, so I cant
compare it. Why I found this movie so good was that you where given the
opportunity to judge for yourself.<br /><br />The first part shows Jeanne as a true hero, she performs miracles that
could
be through inspiration of a god. The priests and the curch are presented
as
humble servants who guide, advice and are overall kind.<br /><br />The second part, the curch is almost evil as they try and crush her
beliefs.
It is hinted that she could very well be sick, and the signs are all in
her
head. I think you are given the choice to decide what part is right and
what
is wrong.<br /><br />Other then that I found the combat scenes to be belivable, in the
beginning
it is about winning, glory and honor. But when it is done, there is death
on
both sides either way.<br /><br />I think it is truly a good movie. If you see it dont expect a new
Braveheart, they are too different to be compared.
