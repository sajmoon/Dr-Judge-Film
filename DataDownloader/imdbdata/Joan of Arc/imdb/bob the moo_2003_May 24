With France at the mercy of English invaders, a young woman, haunted by
visions from God, approaches Charles VII and begs him to give her an army on
the basis of her visions.  He yields to her faith and soon battles begun to
be won due to her inspired approach to the war.  However with the English on
the retreat and Charles crowned King of France, the tone of the country
changes and Joan is desired more by the English for revenge than she is by
the French rulers for her victories.<br /><br />I came to this with an awareness of the bad reviews and I must admit that
many of them have been rather harsh.  Perhaps it is your expectation &#150; I had
no hopes that this would be anything other than a film and am already very
accustom to `historical' films being far from the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.  So all I expected was a reasonable film which was
watchable and, in fairness, that's all I got.<br /><br />As often is the case with Besson, the substance is very much second to style
and thus the story is historically very dubious at best.  Happily the style
and delivery of the film is all and he does direct it well.  The battle
scenes are exciting without being as grand as we've seen it done elsewhere. 
When it comes down to the politics of the beast then the film falters a bit
and Besson can't deliver something that is compelling.  The last 30 minutes
are a real drag and are only really redeemed by one (surprising) factor. 
Contrary to the other reviews here &#150; that factor was Dustin
Hoffman.<br /><br />While I agree that another actor could have done better, Hoffman does a good
job on the most part.  His cynicism helps dispel the myth that had been
build up in the previous 2 hours and is quite refreshing to have questions
asked instead of just fighting.  He is a strange choice but I think his New
York sceptic approach works (despite being set in medieval France).  He
certainly works better than many others in the cast.  Jovovich is a
beautiful blonde-haired, blue eyes peasant girl with a perfect accent and
mannerisms &#150; one would have hoped she would have at least tried to be a
peasant rather than a warrior princess but ho-hum.  She can't carry the role
for the majority of the film and is not a good enough actress.  However
other better actors also flounder with Malkovich just having a laugh, Cassel
almost being a warrior clown and Dunaway looking sinister behind the
scenes.<br /><br />Overall this is stylish enough to watch once but for God's sake don't expect
a really good film, a thoughtful film or one that bares anything but a
passing resemblance to the real Joan D'Arc.
