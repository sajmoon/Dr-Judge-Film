Was he God?  Or was he Satan?  Whoever Dustin Hoffman's character was
supposed to be, he saved &quot;The Messenger&quot; from a cliche ending.  Joan's agony
of faith as her execution neared became the most interesting part of the
film thanks to the shadowy personage who visits her in her dungeon.  The
games-playing in these scenes, which Hoffman and Milla Jovavich enact so
well, makes them prime material for student actors.  Then there is the
portrayal of the opposite voices of Joan's conscience ... God and Satan ...
that few actors could have carried off so powerfully as Dustin Hoffman. 
These scenes are truly memorable.  Much of the rest of the film is
confusing.  I had a hard time understanding who were the French and who were
the English in those battle scenes.  There was a nightmarish quality to the
depiction of Joan's visions, which conforms to the film maker's image of
Joan as a possibly demented young woman.  From what is known or suspected
about the historical Joan of Arc, I think the producers and the director of
&quot;The Messenger&quot; have presented us with no more or less true a Joan than can
be expected from events that occurred 570 years ago.  They are within their
prerogative to make her the &quot;Mad Maid of Orleans&quot; if they choose and at that
they have been successful.  At the finish, however, as Joan is burning at
the stake, they relent somewhat by flashing the Cross as, ostensibly, the
last thing that Joan sees on this Earth.  Does this establish that Dustin
Hoffman's character is God after all, or is the Cross simply one more
freakish image thrown at a dying and tortured mind?
