There are only few things which are changed my point of view to live so
much. One of these things is Besson's 'Joan of Arc'.
You will ask - why? What so elated and persuaded me in this incredibly
fantastic movie?
First, historical accuracy. You didn't mishear me, h i s t o r i c a l
accuracy. Not that one, which only remembers numbers of dead, years and
dates of fights, but something else - which remembers what the human was
in
middle ages, what was that atmosphere - dark, mysterious, horrifying - in
which human had to exist. And movie is truly one of honest points of view
to
middle ages.
Second, very professional work of all team. Everyone have done his job at
best - start from actors and end with musicians. I don't judge those
people
which are saying that Milla was horrible - if that Joan what is in their
minds doesn't match with Milla's and Besson's imagination, is their
problem.
Because six centuries is too much long for true. We can only imagine it
how
it was when a 17 years old poor peasant girl have all those things in
mind.
Mostly we can blame Besson because he don't prettify anything. He don't
prettify nor makes beautiful those things we are surviving every day -
sorrow, pain, hate, despair.
Still on other things - music is simply one word - best. I don't know
other
example where is shown how easy is possible to merge modern, ambient music
with classical. Sierra has done it and has done it great. And end title
song
- 'My heart is calling' - is saying everything what is left to
say.
And, at least, main and most point why I think it is one of greatest
movies
I have ever seen - that is it's human point of view. We see Joan of Arc
not
as historical person, but as human creature, who suffers, blames, hopes,
cries. She was a human, not a hero nor a saint.<br /><br />'...Open Your Arms,
Let's love him'
