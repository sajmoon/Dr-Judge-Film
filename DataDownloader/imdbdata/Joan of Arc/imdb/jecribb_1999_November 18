<br /><br />In an attempt to interest 90's audiences in the story of Joan of Arc, Luc
Besson has attempted to fuse together the action film with a drama of the
moral dilemmas of war and religion.<br /><br />Though I rarely watch action films, I found the battle scenes intense
and
amazing. They had the viewer deep into the battle among the soldiers much
like Joan herself. This effect gave a feeling of the hysteria of violence
that is war. The weak leg of the film, I found, was the script around the
battle scences. The dialogue had moments of attempting to be too many
things
in one film. Sometimes it reminded me of THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1973) where
during fights there would be attempts of humorous side bars that just
didn't
seem to work. Then it would become a surreal moral drama. Some of the
language was at time too contemporary and accents varied widely from
British
to French to Mid-Western American without regard of character. With that
said, it really was a very good film of visual messages.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is very good, also. She conveys an obsessive young girl
who has the exuberance of youth and a romantisized inspiration of fighting
for God. Jovovich shines in the battle sequences and maintains thoughout
Joan's imprisonment. From what I had read in other reviews, I was afraid I
wouldn't be able to watch or listen to her, but I found her very likeable
in
the role. As for the other performances, Miss Dunaway was very good(though
I
kept thinking of Milady in Three Musketeers) and Malkovich and Hoffman
were
adequate but not much more. Some of the best performances come from the
members of the cast that make up the generals and soldiers who are forced
to
work with Joan in her mission. These gentlemen give invigorating
performances that live up to the battle scenes.<br /><br />The most effecting focus of the film is the cinematography and
editing.
Sometimes I felt as though I was experiencing one of Joan visions. The
picture would appear to float and feel very dreamy in Klimt-like
landscapes.
The intermingling of her visions and then movements back into reality
created a sence of &quot;where are we now&quot; but then I was never lost in the
story. It resumed with a pace of her mission; to save France for God. This
film is one of the most visually challenging films I have seen that was
beautiful and created movement at the same time(without giving me one of
those over-edit headaches like a commercial).<br /><br />I have seen other versions of Joan and THE MESSENGER is as good as
most.
THE MESSENGER treats a legendary story of Joan as an action packed display
of blood and moral confusion and finally lets the viewer conclude about
the
voices in our head and the destiny that we live.
