This must be one of Bessons best movies ever. It is very suggestive and the
music just adds to it. (Hurray for Serra!) I can't understand why everybody
is complaining about Milla's performances - there is nothing bad about it.
On the contrary she proves that she can be an actress with great depth.
Malkovich is as usual splendid and Dustin Hoffman is at first hard to
recognize but later one see how good he fits in his role  as the mysterious
man - perhaps God? I don't know.
Another funny fact is that the English king is played by a man who in the
movie &quot;Braveheart&quot; was the supreme judge of London - thats what I call
climbing the latter of success.<br /><br />All in all this movie is very deep. The photo is overwhelming and the
costumes is well made. It includes both brutal action and humor along with
drama and is therefor difficult to pinpoint its genre.<br /><br />So hats of for Besson and his team for a movie well done.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />P.S the 2 h 40 min slips away very quick so don't be frighten by the movies
running time.
