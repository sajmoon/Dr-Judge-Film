1999_November 10 

I had a tough time with this film. Admittedly, my expectation levels were
high based on Besson's previous work, a clear source of bias indeed. A few
plusses first: visually stunning, great camera angles and placements that
seem to bring out the details of the characters' movements and physical
idiosyncracies. Excellent 'raw' battle scenes, great attention to costumes
and the weaponry (armor too) of the era. However, despite outstanding
performances by John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman, Milla's constant grating
on-screen paroxysms were distracting from the pace and true meaning of this
so-called epic. I can see where Besson was going, delving into the secular
and religious dichotomy within the state...however, casting Milla as the
&quot;messenger&quot; representing both faith and conceit, well...goes awry rather
quickly. It's difficult to give the character of Joan any credibility when
Milla's performance was so lacking...if that was Besson's intent, well, so
be it. I was squirming during the last half hour, praying the film would
just end. True epics aren't disjointed or forced. Unfortunately, _The
Messenger_ was both, and glaringly so.
