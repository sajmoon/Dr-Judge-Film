2000_April 23 

I gave this 8/10 despite its problems<br /><br />This film is not historically correct and the facts have been altered to
support the film's thesis.  Simply put: Joan was motivated by revenge and
was mildly insane - perhaps schizophrenic.  She was not very intelligent,
just full of anger - her objective was to see the dauphin crowned king and
drive the English away, at any cost<br /><br />The church both condemns her and then canonize her - what
hypocrisy!<br /><br />The war scenes are horrific, but probably nowhere near as bad as the truth
really was.  I was horrified by the killing and mutilation; but from the
point of view of the people that were there.  Humans are truly despicable in
what they can and do do to each other.<br /><br />Joan annoyed me.  There is little depth to the character.  Notice also that
her hair changes from blonde to brown half way through the
film?<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman, as always, was excellent. Especially when he makes fun of
Joan find the sword!<br /><br />I wish I has seen this on the big screen.  I would also love to know what
was cut out from the International version.  If anybody has seen the DVD and
the video please let me know the difference in the two
films.
