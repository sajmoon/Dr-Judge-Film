1999_November 24 

I don't even know where to start with this movie. Well hold on let me back
up a bit. When I first heard that a full length movie was going to be made
about one of my favorite characters in history, I was extremely excited.
After impatiently waiting for the release of the movie, I finally went to
see it with my mother ( I'm only in high school, Ii couldn't get in myself.
The fact it was R even disturbed me, considering the story of a religous
figure had no need to be that graphic). My first impression of the movie was
good, I felt that the girl portraying the young Joan did an excellent job,
but the
depicting of Jesus disturbed me quite a bit. As the movie went on I started
to notice the complete mockery they were making out of this woman, to many
people, a religous figure whom they believe strongly in. I was apalled and
the interpretations of her actions. Her visions were overdramatized, and
they made Joan seem like she was a full- blooded lunatic, compelled by some
wordly feeling that drove her to war. The religous facts were completely
ignored. And maybe I am just taking this a step too far, but was that Satan
that Joan was talking to by the end of the movie? From what they implied I
think it was, and I couldn't have been more appalled. Any one who had no
idea about the story of Joan of Arc before this movie was probably
influenced quite a bit by this depiction of the Saint. Now people belieive
that she really was a heretic, a sinner, a crusader for her own purposes,
and finally tempted by Satan. Someone just watching this film from the
surface would believe that Joan conjured up these visions to her own liking.
This movie made a mockery out of the Catholic church and out of one of the
most influencial characters in
history.
