It's a movie you should not miss.
It's a movie should have been admired.
(Unfortunately, I only see movie critics said how bad this movie
was.)
It's a movie with both entertainment and depth.
It's a movie which still echo in my mind after watching it for
weeks.
In my humble opinion,the history,legend or battle in this movie are not the
main thing.
They are just something pushing Joan's mind forward.
They're just decoration.
The focus is on Joan's mind.See how she react with things happening around
her and inside her.
I think Milla is wonderful.She potrayed Joan as a human, a girl but not a
hero we really don't know.
This Joan carries a tortured soul but always brave, loyal and honest to
herself , her faith, and her country.
A must see. Simply Great!!!!
