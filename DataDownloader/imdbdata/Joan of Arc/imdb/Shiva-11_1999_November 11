The Messenger: Luc Beeson's epic re-telling of the life of Joan of Arc- her
childhood, rise in popularity, victory over the British, eventual betrayal,
and untimely demise.  Two things annoyed me about this film: first - at two
hours and thirty minutes -it is long and you feel it.  Beeson could have cut
several scenes (flashbacks, and hallucinations) without compromising his
vision , indeed it probably would have given the film a little more balance. Second Joan's lengthy introspective journey to discover herself (the last
half-hour of the movie) was too time consuming and esoteric for my tastes. 
Finally, there was a &quot;Holy Grail&quot; feel to some of the battle scenes (they
seemed to revel in the amputations and decapitations).  Now for the
good.<br /><br />The cinematography is simple and straightforward, and relies on the sweeping
landscapes to set the mood.  The feel is further enhanced by the lavish,
thundering soundtrack.  The real triumph is the characterization of
Joan.<br /><br />Rather than settle for a rehash of the traditional saintly portrayal, the
writers opted for a different tack, depicting Joan as a headstrong, reckless
warrior not afraid to wallow in blood (until it's too late).  The only
reason this gamble pays off is Milla Jovovich (Joan): she delivers an
impassioned performance, creating a character that is strong, yet
vulnerable, and most importantly, believable.  I have always felt that she
is an underutilized actress.  I don't think that will be a problem anymore.<br /><br />
