In the year of 1422, England decides to invade France, and horrible battles
await. At the same time, a young girl gets a message from heaven. She has
been chosen to help the king of France against the English. And that girl&acute;s
name was Joan Of Arc. She&acute;s the messenger of God. <br /><br />In the past, Luc Besson has made great films, but these days he is light
years away from his old self. &quot;The Messenger&quot; is actually really bad
compared his old classics &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; and &quot;Le&oacute;n&quot;. The massive battle
scenes are impressive to look at, but the script Besson has written is quite
dull and does not get anywhere. There are no likeable characters whatsoever
and the dialogue is not very intriguing.<br /><br />The acting is not very impressive either. Milla Jovovich gives it her all in
the title role, but she&acute;s not believable as Joan. Instead she becomes
irritating when she is supposed to lead her forces in the battles. Jovovich
can be good when she gets the right type of roles, but this does not fit her
at all. 
John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo and Dustin Hoffman have all been
in far better movies and delivered far better performances.<br /><br />In spite of a promising beginning with beautiful settings and the violent
battle scenes, that reminds a lot of the rawness in Braveheart, this is a
new low from Luc Besson. A film that runs to long, and during the last hour
you are way to bored to actually care how things will end up for Joan Of
Arc. It could have been an exciting way to learn something new, but this
feels more like a slow history lesson at school.<br /><br />* * out of * * * * *
