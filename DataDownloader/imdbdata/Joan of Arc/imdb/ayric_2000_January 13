To make a 140+ minutes long movie you should be reeeeeally sure that the
movie is gonna be spectacular. This is far from spectacular, and dragging
out to be this long makes it pure torture. Besson has made a few great
movies, but d'Arc he has done as he did with Le Grand Bleu: butchered it
with poor humor. And Milla Jovovich: I can't think of many women prettier
than you, but STICK TO POSING FOR CAMERAS! YOU CAN'T ACT!
