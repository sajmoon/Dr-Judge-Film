Granted I understand that some people who saw this movie had never studied
the life of Joan Of Arc. But if people came to see this movie in hopes of
being more educated on the life of this treasured saint, then this is the
WRONG movie for them to see! This movie, in my opinion trashed every inch of
Joan's character.<br /><br />Now see I have grown up loving the story of Joan of Arc, so I take stuff
like this personally. We all have seen movies of legendary heros such as
Braveheart, The Patriot and Rob Roy...and people come out of those movies
feeling patriotic because the men in the film were portrayed truly as
heros...they were heros. This movie, although advertising Joan's story as a
historical epic was completely deceiving. The writer made Joan look like a
complete lunatic, and after sitting through 3/4s of it I was just begging
for them to burn her at the stake to just get it over with. Not that I was
glad that they burned the real Joan of Arc. It was the reason that Joan's
character in this movie was so wacko and skittish, you just wanted to put
her out of her misery. Of course, I don't blame Milla J. for acting
accordingly. I think she is a moderately creditable actress, and plays this
part well. She plays it well as a catalyst from the writing. The writing
here is the problem as well as the over all vision. She plays &quot;Joan the
lunatic&quot; well. So it's not her fault that Joan was protrayed this way.
However, if I had been in the film I would have challenged the writing a
bit.<br /><br />I normally am not the type of person to seem so critical about a movie...but
I just felt that this movie was an insult to the real Joan of Arc.
Historically, and period-wise the film was accurate. But the portrayl of
Joan of Arc (Who was a true hero) was completely deceiving!
