Luc Besson (director) creates fantastic images of early 14th century France
-- so bright and clear, they're almost surreal.  The movie traces Joan of
Arc's (Milla Jovovich) life from childhood mysticism through her almost cult
status as a populist leader of the French armies against the English,
through her imprisonment, trial, and death at the stake.  While I'm
admittedly not that familiar with the historical Joan (I have a few memories
of learning about her in French class many years ago), the movie to me plays
heavily on the voices she hears, and the effect they have on her. 
Certainly, the voices she sees drive her and France to great things. Yet,
the movie loses steam about halfway through, and drags on to its inevitable
end.  I found myself wishing they'd just get on with it.
