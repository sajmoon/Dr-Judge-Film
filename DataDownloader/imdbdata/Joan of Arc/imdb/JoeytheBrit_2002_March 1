Considering how badly this movie starts - horribly pretentious and flashy
direction, symbolic wolves running through a forest, beautiful young girl
running through endless fields of flowers and proclaiming that everything is
wonderful - I'm surprised by how much I eventually came to enjoy this film
(although it is by no means a great movie).  <br /><br />That Joan's sister was raped after being pinned to a door by the sword found
by her little sister is questionable to say the least.  The scene seems
unnecessary,and a poor device to cast doubt on whether the voices she heard
were from God, or simply a mental state caused by the horror she witnessed
as an over-zealously religious child.<br /><br />Although Milla Jovovich won a Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for this
role, I actually believe her performance is highly commendable.  No
shrinking violet would have led an army to victory, only a highly-driven and
domineering character would have been capable of inspiring such deeds. 
Equally, being touched by God (or horror) would also make an impression on a
teenage girl's character.  The fact is, Jovovich's role in this movie isn't
to be liked but is meant to convey something of the energy and zeal that
must have driven such an inspirational figure.  Jovovich captures this
character perfectly, and portrays the doubts she experiences upon her
incarceration with confidence and skill.<br /><br />The pace of the movie slows considerably once Joan is captured by the
Burgundians and English (who, sadly, all talk and behave like football
hooligans), which is a shame.  The battle scenes that dominate the first
half of the film are highly effective, and are accompanied by a superb
score.<br /><br />All in all, well worth viewing.
