I didn't know all that much about Joan of Arc outside of
the
fact that she was supposedly a disturbed peasant girl who
created a forgettable disturbance in her time period. At
least
I didn't actively dislike her until I saw this movie. If it was the
intention of the director to present her story impartially, he
sure
didn't achieve it. The acting was really good, but Milla's
depiction
of Joan comes across to me at least, as that of a clinically insane
teenager. I found the movie absorbing, but by the middle of the
film
I really grew to dislike Joan intensely. Joan in the movie as depicted
seemed arrogant, stupid and hysterical throughout the movie.
If you can watch this movie without thinking of Joan as a full
fledged
psychotic, my hat is off to you. This movie is very well
acted and the sets are great and it did have an emotional
impact.
I am not sure if it was supposed to get the viewer to dislike
this
historical figure, but it certainly accomplished this for
me.
