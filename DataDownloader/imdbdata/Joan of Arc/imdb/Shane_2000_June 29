I am sorry but the best part of this movie is the credits. The only awards
it deserves is the Razzies. Yes, the movie is visually stunning in both
special effects and cinematography. Yes, the movie might be more
historical
acurate than others. Yes, Milla Jovavich looks the part. However, the
acting
SUCKS. They could not act in it to save their lives! Milla ought to go
back
to being just a model and make-up covergirl and relish that her only
acting
triumph is Blue Lagoon Two. Ah, but she is Luc Besson's girl, so her
acting
career is insured. For now. Well, enough of the acting. One more thing is
the scene with Joan's sister and the soldiers(hope no spoiler there).
There
is no call and no reason for that scene. Period! Allin all, I think that
Besson should stick to writing and give up the directing
bit.
