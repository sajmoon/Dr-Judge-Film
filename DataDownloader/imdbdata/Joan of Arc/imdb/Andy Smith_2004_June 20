When God (Dustin Hoffman) challenges Joan of Arc's (Milla Jovanovich -
spelling ?) understanding of finding a sword in the field, what he does is
say that reality is what we want to see - not necessarily what is. Jean Paul
Sartre would be proud - Kirkegard would roll over in his
grave.<br /><br />A young girl confused about her purpose in life could not lead the French to
victory - God is not wishy washy about what he calls us to do. But beyond
the weak theology; this is an excellent film - well written, great acting -
yes I even enjoyed Hoffman's portrayal of God.<br /><br />This story surrounds Joan of Arc's quest to drive out the British from 15th
Century France to establish Charles the VII as king of France. In the
process she also avenges her sister's rape and death at the hands of a
British soldier. Joan's possible self doubt and confusion is well portrayed
by Jovanovich.<br /><br />The good news is that there is no gratuitous nudity.<br /><br />The bad news is that there is much blood and gore - but I have seen worse
(such as Saving Private Ryan.<br /><br />There is also much use of the F--- word which is derived from the 17th
Century reason for punishment of people &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot;. So
the use of that word I believe is anachronistic.<br /><br />Even though; I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to mature
audiences.<br /><br />Andy Smith
