I really loved this movie. I've read a thousand reviews, some good, some
bad, but I haven't been able to find any mention whatsoever about Desmond
Harrington.  He's the guy who played Aulon, the archer and Jeanne's
faithful, love-lorn sidekick.  Am I the only person who thinks that his
performance completely scintillated?  I was rapt, wholly captivated every
time he was on screen.  Granted, there were a few scenes when he wasn't all
that convincing, but it's his debut film.  I'm willing to cut him some
slack.  His portrayal of Aulon was one of the great successes of this film.
He was so intense, so heart-breakingly sincere.  It just seemed to me that
while all the other characters were simply saying that they would have
walked straight into hell for her, he was the only one who I truly believed
would have gone through with it willingly, without a glance back.  He shone
far more than his more experienced and celebrated co-stars (John Malkovich,
maybe...).  I just can't figure out why his performance has been so
completely over- looked.  He had a very significant role, more so than
Tcheky Karyo or Vincent Casseles (who were both quite good, also), but
nowhere is he mentioned.  I would very much like to discuss his performance
further, so if you feel the same way, please write me.
