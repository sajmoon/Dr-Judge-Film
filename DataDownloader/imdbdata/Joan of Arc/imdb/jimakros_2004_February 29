This movie is very well directed and has impressive battle scenes,costumes
and locations.<br /><br />The interpretation of Joan of Ark as played by Mila Jovovich is interesting
and succeeds in the part of being a fearless and couragious military leader
that soldiers followed.The part about her divinity is more controversial and
the movie does not really explain it.<br /><br />I didnt like the fact that everybody spoke English and i think the movie
loses enormously because of this.<br /><br />All in all however, i think it is a powerfull movie and tells an impressive
story but i dont know how much it has to do with historical
fact.
