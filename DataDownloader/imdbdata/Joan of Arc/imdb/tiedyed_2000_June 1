I did not enjoy this movie. It made Joan to look like a psycho. She was
talking to herself in order to justify her wanting revenge on her enemies. I
must say I thought it was a different idea as I have never seen a movie take
this stance with the story of Joan (making her crazy instead of a saint).
This did help make it a bit more interesting but still my need for belief in
the mystical and magical negated this movie. After a while I just wanted it
to be over.<br /><br />I was not impressed by Milla's performance as Joan in the least. She acted
fanatic at most times and reminded me a lot as her character from Fifth
Element especially near the end. This made it hard for me to really get into
the story.<br /><br />I'd hate to admit this but I would have to say that I enjoyed the little
made for TV movie starring Doogie Howser as the king of France more than
this movie. And that is sad...<br /><br />If you feel you must see it, I wouldn't bother renting this movie until it
has come off the new release wall at the video store.
