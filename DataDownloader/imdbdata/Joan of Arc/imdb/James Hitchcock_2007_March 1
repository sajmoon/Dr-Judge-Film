Joan of Arc may have defeated the English armies, but she could not
prevent the tyranny of the English language over her native land. Here
we have an ostensibly French film about a French national heroine, made
by a French director and producer and featuring a number of French
actors. And made in English. The choice of language was presumably
influenced by the need to succeed at the American box-office, a factor
which also accounts for the casting of Hollywood luminaries such as
Faye Dunaway, Dustin Hoffman and John Malkovich. It also partly
accounts for the horrible miscasting in the leading role of a Ukrainian
fashion model turned Hollywood starlet, although Milla Jovovich&#39;s claim
cannot have been harmed by the fact that, at the time the film was
made, she also went by the name of Madame Luc Besson.<br /><br />The actual cause for which Joan fought seems remote from modern
concerns. The Hundred Years War was not, as we tend to assume today, a
clash between rival English and French patriotisms, but rather a power
struggle between two rival dynasties, the houses of Valois and
Lancaster, neither of whom had right on their side. The Dauphin Charles
(who was probably illegitimate) based his claim on the Salic Law, which
had been introduced into France by King Philip V in 1316 to justify his
usurping the throne which otherwise would have gone to his young niece.
As for his nephew and rival Henry VI, he was not even the rightful king
of England, being the grandson of another usurper who had overthrown
and murdered his predecessor.<br /><br />Joan claimed to have been inspired to fight for Charles by messages
from God. Few people today, except perhaps right-wing Catholic French
nationalists, would regard this claim, which presupposes a deity with
an inordinate interest in the niceties of French succession law, as a
literal statement of fact, so succeeding ages have tended to remake
Joan in their own image. If this devout Catholic and ardent partisan of
the ruling dynasty remains a heroine in modern France, a country which
is not only republican but also officially secular, it is because she
is seen as an apostle of national liberation avant la lettre. Her story
has been used in numerous plays and films to reflect the preoccupations
of the periods in which they were written or made. Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;Henry
VI Part I&quot;, written at a time of great patriotic fervour shortly after
the defeat of the Armada, treats her disrespectfully as an enemy of
England. Schiller&#39;s &quot;Die Jungfrau von Orleans&quot; reflects its author&#39;s
interest in the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Shaw&#39;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot;
(filmed by Otto Preminger in 1957) anachronistically makes its heroine
a spokeswoman for Protestantism and nationalism. (Shaw seems to have
wanted to provoke the Catholic Church, which had canonised Joan shortly
before his play was written). Brecht&#39;s Marxist version &quot;Saint Joan of
the Stockyards&quot; updates her story to 20th-century Chicago. Jean
Anouilh&#39;s &quot;L&#39;Alouette&quot; follows the official line in making Joan an icon
of French patriotism, as does Victor Fleming&#39;s 1948 film with Ingrid
Bergman (made soon after World War II and the liberation of France from
Nazi rule). There is even a recent TV sitcom called &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;.<br /><br />Besson&#39;s film does not try to impose any particular ideological line on
Joan&#39;s story, but it does perhaps reflect a modern interest in
psychology. This is done by the device of having Hoffman appear as the
voice of Joan&#39;s conscience, her conversations with him representing her
inner thoughts in dramatic form. In one scene Joan sees her older
sister raped and murdered by English soldiers. Although there is no
historical basis for this, there may be some psychological truth; it is
entirely possible that Joan&#39;s burning hatred of the English, and her
conviction of a Divine mission to fight them, were inspired by her
witnessing brutal acts of this sort.<br /><br />There have been a number of French films about Joan, none of which I
have seen, but attempts to film her story in English have not been very
successful. Fleming&#39;s film is stolid and long-winded. Preminger&#39;s is
slightly better, but did badly at the box office. (Much of the blame
for this was placed- in my view unfairly- on the film&#39;s young star Jean
Seberg). Besson&#39;s, however, struck me as being, except in the realism
of its battle scenes, as the weakest of the three, and in this case I
felt that the blame must lie with its star. Quite frankly, Jovovich
does not strike me as being the sort of actress to turn to if one is
looking for psychological depth, as her husband clearly was here. One
gets little sense from her performance of whether Joan was insane, or a
fraud, or genuinely inspired.<br /><br />Whatever the weakness of his claim to the throne, Charles VII (as the
Dauphin became) was to prove one of France&#39;s most effective monarchs,
and is remembered today as Charles the Victorious. One gets little
sense of this from the film, but the fault lies less with John
Malkovich (who plays him as Charles the Complete Nincompoop) than with
the tradition in films and plays on this subject of portraying the
Dauphin was a weak, indecisive coward in order to make a contrast with
the strong, decisive, courageous Joan. There are some better
performances such as Timothy West as the scheming Bishop Cauchon, but
none of these lift the film out of the ordinary. Like the 1948 version,
it is too long, and ends up as little more than a wearisome historical
pageant. 5/10, chiefly for the battle scenes.
