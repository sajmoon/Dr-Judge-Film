2000_February 7 

One of the biggest shocks I have ever had at the cinema was when I saw
&quot;Leon&quot;. I had seen the trailer and, frankly, thought it looked appalling.
Gary Oldman's &quot;I Love the calm before the storm&quot; followed by some over the
top weaponry made it look like the sort of film you'd expect to see Bruce
Willis in. I eventually saw the film when bored one Sunday afternoon. It
was
one of the best films I have seen in my life.<br /><br />&quot;Jeanne d'Arc&quot; is &quot;Leon&quot;'s polar opposite. A stylish, intruiging trailer
for
a disgrace of a film.<br /><br />I'll ignore the historical inaccuracies. I'll ignore the needlessly
gratuitous violence. I'll ignore Milla Jovovich's woefully inadequate
acting
skills. I'll even ignore the disgustingly inappropriate and historically
inaccurate rape scene. For me, the most unbelievable aspect of the film was
the differences between how the French and the English were
protrayed.<br /><br />Whereas the French were gallant, handsome, humorous and full of honour in
battle, the English were protrayed as savages, ugly, stupid, dishonourable
rapists with Noblemen (which in the film seems like a contradiction in
terms)unable to mutter more than a few words without unleashing a stream of
expletives (as opposed to the running joke where a single Frenchman is
corrected everytime he uses one of the mildest swearwords
available).<br /><br />I left the cinema with a bad taste in my mouth. In the past I have forgiven
Luc Besson for his films being seemingly more interested in style than
minor
things like plot and character development, but it will be many years
before
I will be able to forgive him for this.
