1999_November 11 

The story of Joan of Arc was never really interesting to me until I went
with a friend to see &quot;The Messenger.&quot;  Milla Jovovich did an excellent job
as a tormented Christian who was dealing with the question of &quot;has God sent
me?&quot;  Dustin Hoffman's rendition of &quot;the Conscience&quot; was thrilling.  The
movie really leaves you questioning your own beliefs about religion.
Although the movie was on the gory side (they were fighting a war, and
all),
overall the film was excellent.  I highly recommend it.
