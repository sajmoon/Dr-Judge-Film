Mila Jovovich is a terrific actress and she proves it in this movie, &quot;Joan
of Arc.&quot;  To start off with, the movie is very sad but true.  Great acting
and great script.  Since the movie is about a true story and a young girl
who is tortured and brutally murdered at the age of nineteen, it is sad.
Cope with it and you'll love the movie.
