If Mr Besson the Director doesn't believe in GOD and wanted to make a
movie
about what else could have inspired a simple French Peasant girl to take
up
arms against her English overlords than one has to be honest and deal with
facts.
Joan of Arcs part of France was NOT invaded by the English but by the
Burgundians who were allies of the English;
Her village was never destroyed by anybody
and her sisters and brothers all outlived her. All her family did except
her
father who died when she was captured.
So revenge is out. Why did she do it then?
Many Christians (including Catholics) don't believe that GOD acts the way
Joan claimed and so there is plenty of interest in a study of this young
woman -- but really!
This is just a sex and violence exploitation not a serious dramatic study
of
a fascinating character in history.
