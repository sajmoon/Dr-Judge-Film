This movie manages to handle a religious theme without being to<br /><br />moralizing or kitschy. The acting is first rate and the<br /><br />cinematography is state of the art. If you can stand some rude<br /><br />knight fights and powerful battle scenery, then come and enjoy this<br /><br />well done movie. I especially enjoyed Dustin Hoffmanns<br /><br />appearance as the dry commentator and mirror of Joan's pure<br /><br />conscience. 8/10
