2000_January 7 

I thought this was a wonderful movie. Besides being fascinated with the
story of Joan herself, I was also captivated by the breath-taking scenery,
the realistic costumes, and, despite the opinion of many critics, the
performance given by Milla Jovovich. I thought it oscar worthy. She was
very
compelling  and brought the character of Joan of Arc to life. I'm sad,
though, that it didn't stay in theaters very long. I guess enough people
didn't go to see it because of all the horrible things critics said about
it. All well...their loss.
