If your a teen grrrl, you'll love this film.
Those of us older, less filled with teen angst and with knowledge of the
Joan of Arc story will find most of the film cliched and irritating.<br /><br />If you make it through the first 2/3 of the film, you'll find Dustin
Hoffman's character adds some decent, thoughtful insights into her story.
This alone elevates the film from appalling to OK.
