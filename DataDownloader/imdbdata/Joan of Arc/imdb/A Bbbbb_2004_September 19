I like the movie. It was informative and the battle scenes were great
which prevents the audience from getting bored. It was a good movie.
Definitely NOT bad as some people would say. It's just sad that this
movie was overlooked. Also, I think Milla Jovovich did a great job of
playing the role of St. Joan of Arc. Her acting was amazing. I watched
some movies of Milla Jovovich and I could say that of all her movies,
it is in this one THAT HER ACTING ABILITIES SHINE! Definitely NOT the
kind of acting people label on &quot;models-trying-hard-to-be-actresses&quot;.
Here, Milla's acting abilities is at par with the acting abilities of
some Hollywood female A-listers.<br /><br />I don't know why other people would say that her acting was bad in the
movie. I think it's because some people can't admit that a woman can be
beautiful and can act at the same time.
