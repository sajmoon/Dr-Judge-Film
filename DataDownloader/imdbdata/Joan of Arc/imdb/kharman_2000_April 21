The performances were great totalling up to Millia Jovovich, John
Malkovich,
Faye Dunoway, and Dustin Hoffman. A lot is left up to the imagination of
the
movie-goer, but stick it out in this one. It is a great movie which isn't
for everyone. The cinematography was also great. The epic war scenes were
awesome and choreographed greatly. Not for the faint of heart
though...
