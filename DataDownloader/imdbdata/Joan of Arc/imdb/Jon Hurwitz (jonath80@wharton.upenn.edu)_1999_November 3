1999_November 3 

I went into The Messenger with the lowest of expectations, given the horrid
word of mouth it has received within Philadelphia's film community, and was
still greatly disappointed with the embarrassment that appeared on the
screen.  It baffles me how this film was permitted to reach the public by
any studio or how such talents as Dustin Hoffman, John Malkovich, and Milla
Hotovich would consider attaching themselves with the project.  Despite
some
beautiful shots (which were the only bright spot of the film), the audience
is treated (or should I say mistreated) to some of the absolute worst
special effects this side of Baby Geniuses.  While attempting to have the
gory effect of Private Ryan or Braveheart, the film's war scenes appeared
straight out of a high school student film or the worst Troma production.
While the effects were laughable, even more embarrassing was the complete
lack of effort in casting.  French and Englishmen sported accents from all
over the world, ranging from their native lands to exotic New Jersey.  I
could see going all the way and using solely American accents if you're
going to do a modern day adaptation like a Romeo &amp; Juliet, but when you are
trying to portray history in its native time and place, at least attempt to
find actors who will sport the correct accents (or who will at least
attempt
accents at all).  This glaring hole is representative of the consistently
lackadaisical interest in authenticity obvious in the filmmaker's work.  Oh
yeah, and the inappropriate scene in which a filthy scumbag rapes a dead
woman in front of a little girl was just completely unnecessary.  Filled
with embarrassments all around, this was the worst of the 50 or so films I
have viewed this year.
