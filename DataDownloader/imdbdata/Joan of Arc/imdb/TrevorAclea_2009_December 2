A few unfortunate lines of dialogue aside, it&#x27;s hard to see why Luc
Besson&#x27;s epic was met with such derision - it&#x27;s full of some terrific
film-making, the battles are the right size, the story&#x27;s well-told and
Milla Jovovich comes over surprisingly well as someone caught somewhere
between God&#x27;s will and psychosis. The inclusion, two hours in, of
Dustin Hoffman as her conscience to address her own and the audience&#x27;s
doubts as to whether she is driven by divine guidance or self-delusion
is an inspired touch that is completely unexpected in a mainstream epic
on this scale. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s also the point when the film almost
crosses the line into Monty Python - the dialogue&#x27;s just too funny too
often, and somehow the notion of a 15th Century French Catholic peasant
girl&#x27;s conscience manifesting itself as a 62-year-old New York Jewish
actor in a cowl doesn&#x27;t seem overly likely. Curiously, these scenes
work better on a second viewing when you&#x27;re not caught so off-guard by
them.<br /><br />On a narrative level, these scenes do help punctuate the back-and-forth
nature of the trial, but it would have probably been much better to
have her in her cell talking to her unseen visions. There are still
some compensations. The trial is well-handled, and Timothy West avoids
the kind of ham that usually marks his cinematic turns (cf Cry Freedom)
to give a surprisingly good performance as a mainly decent man trapped
in an impossible situation, very similar to Ray MacAnally&#x27;s role in The
Mission. It&#x27;s not a flawless film by any means, but it is one of the
better and more ambitious 90s epics and one that&#x27;s long overdue for
reappraisal.
