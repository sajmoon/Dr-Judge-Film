1999_December 2 

In the beginning I thought this would be a kind of Indiana Jones medieval
adventure film, although the sequences of Joans visions were really
beautiful, the images and the sound was stunning. The music is stunning
all
through the film. Then, when Joan is arrested and the old man in black
visits her, the film gets into another mood. I was like in trance when all
through the film, because of the hypnotic effect of the wonderful images
combined with the glorious music. The actress who plays Joan is also doing
a
great job, as are the others. The only funny thing I noticed that her
hairstyle looks the one Jean Seberg had, but since Seberg is so much
connected to filming the story of Joan no one making a film about Joan can
escape her mythos. There are also some good jokes in the movie, so it has
not a totally grave atmosphere.
