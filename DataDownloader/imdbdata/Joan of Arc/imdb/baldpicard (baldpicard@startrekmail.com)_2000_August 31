Yes, the similarities to Mel Gibson's Braveheart are scary :) Both movies
feature big battles, historical aspects, nice main actors and even similar
endings. If you - like me - do like such really big movies, like
Braveheart
or the latest The Patriot, then you'll love Joan of Arc, too. The only
thing
that I can imagine people would find annoying or boring is this religious
stuff, that lead Joan's deeds and actions. Dustin Hoffman as her
conscience
was fab! I really like Milla Jovovich since 5th Element and director Luc
Besson even longer. The only thing I personally found annoying was this
terrible 'cut' at about 3/4 of the movie. I've been so much in all these
battles and fights and suddenly she was arrested. It seemed that they made
a
a little cut in order to keep the movie 'short' :)
8 or 9 points out of 10 for The Messenger - Story of Joan of
Arc.
