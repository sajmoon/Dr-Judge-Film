1999_November 14 

This film had lots of pretty shots and an interesting subject matter, but
somehow -- in the 2.5 hrs of screentime available to the script writers --
they managed to fail to develop any of the characters so that they were of
any great interest.  I felt pretty detached from the characters, for the
most part.  The dialog was largely uninspiring.  The characters never
really
show you what they are made of.  Even Jean d'Arc's character seemed
painfully one-dimensional.  Since we all know how the story ends, you would
think that there would be some attempt to put some juiciness in the middle,
but this just wasn't there.  The way they resort to brief flashbacks to
fill
in some of the most interesting parts of the story is disappointing.  This
film was impressive in some ways, but it could have been so much better!  A
partial, but not total disappointment.
