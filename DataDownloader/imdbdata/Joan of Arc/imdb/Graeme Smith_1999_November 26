1999_November 26 

The movie is truly atrocious.  Instead of being portrayed as the powerful
and inspirational figure that she was, Joan D'Arc comes across as an
insipid
dumb blonde, and a looney.  For most of the movie she alternates between
seeming like a frightened rabbit (as somebody else commented) and a plain
air-head.  Not really the type of character you would expect to inspire the
might of France, and strike fear into the English.<br /><br />The Messenger gets off to a very poor start. Despite being based on real
historic events it seemed completely contrived and unbelievable to the
point
of being stupid.  A lot of this comes down to the choice of actresses to
play Joan.  Despite not seeing 5th Element, I'm told her non-talking part
was fine.  But in choosing his wife to play a role that required serious
acting Luc Besson has doomed this movie to a very quick demise.  Beyond the
acting, much of the problem may have been the script and direction.  Even
John Malchovic, in my opinion one of the best actors in the world,
*********
Many people seeing this movie may be more interested in the battle scenes
than the acting or historical accuracy.  About a third of the way through
they won't be disappointed.  The war scene in the middle is admittedly
good.
Unfortunately for the next 2 hours even the action buffs will have to put
up with the intense boredom of the remainder of the film.  All of the
people
I was with, half of who enjoyed the first part of the movie, were squirming
in their seats by the end hoping for Joan to get burned so they could get
out of the cinema.<br /><br />That all said, 157 people in IMDB still did rate the movie a 10.  So unless
they are all friends in the industry somebody may have liked this
movie.<br /><br />
