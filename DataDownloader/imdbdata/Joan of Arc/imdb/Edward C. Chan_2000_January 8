If Luc Besson were a door-to-door salesman, I would be his sucker any
minute.  His film, The Messenger, may yet be the most psychologically
accurate account of the story of Jeanne d'Arc.  Besson attempts to
rationalise her actions and with stunning reality.<br /><br />Behind her armour, Besson speculates that Jeanne d'Arc is simply another
victim of war, so tramatised that her questionable sanity led her country
to
victory, at least for a while.  He also went on and modelled the other
characters as people who care about nothing but themselves, not common even
by to-day's standards.<br /><br />Beyond its value as a psycho-drama, however, the film is simply supported
by
a series of fight scenes with lots of armour, impressive siege weapons, and
blood and gore.  Besson focused too much into Jeanne's psyche that there
was
not enough time for the characters to develop, including Jeanne herself.
As
a result, the film seems empty, the plot linear, and the acting
mechanical.<br /><br />The way Besson divided the film, I often could not help myself but to
associate it with George Orwell's novel &quot;1984.&quot;  There are striking
similarities between the two work, both in structure and context which
makes
me wonder if this is where he drew his inspiration.<br /><br />Despite the use modernised language (that is, fudge, sheet, etc.,) The
Messenger is reasonable entertainment for those who thrives on realism, but
are not too interested in any in-depth post-movie discussion.
