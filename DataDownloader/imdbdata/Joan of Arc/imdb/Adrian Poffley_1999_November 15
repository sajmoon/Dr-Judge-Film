Some of us in the world aren't historians, but we do know enough to
appreciate the ties that a movie gives to what actually happened. Would
you
sit through a 2 hour history lesson as it explores each detail without ANY
entertainment what-so-ever? I doubt it. Siskel gave the movie a thumb
down,
why? Because it didn't depict &quot;every aspect&quot; of Joan's life. Instead,
Besson
has taken such a story and combined it with the myth. He has given us, in
the modern times, a movie that we can appreciate both for it's historical
fact, AND his talent to produce energy and excitement in such a tale. I
for
one appreciated this movie for it's essence, it's talent, even it's
script.
I'm not biased by my admiration for Joan of Arc, La Pucelle, I'm standing
here to proclaim my love for such a movie that has been a GIFT more than a
target for the &quot;critics&quot;.
