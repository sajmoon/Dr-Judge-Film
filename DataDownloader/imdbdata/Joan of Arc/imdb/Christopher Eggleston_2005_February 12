This film is ludicrous racist rubbish, Besson should be criticised
widely for producing such a surreal diatribe, that ignores the history
to the power struggle between France and England instead concentrates
on overly emotional story of one person who was more betrayed by
Charles the VII than her enemy England.<br /><br />Chilish portrayal of demonic English and ever so twee French happy go
lucky peasants is sickening twaddle and real you would expect more of a
so call great director.<br /><br />Don't humour him by watching this.<br /><br />Avoid as historically incorrect as JFK.
