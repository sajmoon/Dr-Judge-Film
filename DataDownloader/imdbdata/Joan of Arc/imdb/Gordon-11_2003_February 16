I truly thought this film was great. I was astonished to see that it has
such a low rating!<br /><br />The script was very good. The film was intense throughout. Milla Jovovich
did a great job in acting. Her facial expressions were right to the point,
her despair was genuine and her sheer cries during the battle were
chilling.
The battle scenes were superb too. There are little films that give you
such
scenes with so much people fighting against each other. There was so much
blood that it was shocking. You thought 'Saving Private Ryan' was shocking
enough? Then watch this. You get arms chopped off, throats slitted, head
bashed and any kind of gore you would imagine. I have to make myself clear
though, I am anti-war.<br /><br />One thing I have to complain though, as Jeanne was so religious, she would
not have said 'Oh my God' upon seeing all the dead and wounded in the
field.
