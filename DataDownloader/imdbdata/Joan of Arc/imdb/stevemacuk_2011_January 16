2011_January 16 
Initially, I approached this movie with a little caution,... as there
have been so many misinterpretations and preconceptions weaved into the
Historic Facts of this period of French/English history, the reality or
not of the &#x27;visions&#x27; and &#x27;auditions&#x27;, and the necessity of this period
of revolutionary turmoil needed to bring about social change on both
sides of the 100 years conflict.<br /><br />At least I was happy to see - Luc Besson as being named as its
director,... thinking that it could have the most sympathetic leaning
towards RESTORING the facts and providing an &#x27;insight&#x27; into correcting
the conflicting &#x27;public record&#x27; distorted at the vested interests of
the time,.. i.e. &#x27;The Church&#x27; and &#x27;The King&#x27; - both of whom abandoned
her, and corrupted the MESSAGE and the MESSENGER.<br /><br />If I were to criticise anything,... it would be the difficult task of
indicating the process of what she &#x27;saw or heard&#x27; during her moments of
&#x27;mediumship&#x27;,... where Dustin Hoffman serenely plays a poorly written
or misrepresentation of this function. <br /><br />However, even applying &#x27;artistic license&#x27;,... I was overwhelmed to see
how close Luc and Andrew Birkin came to writing a script providing us
with a moving and compelling record of events,... and how they managed
to orientate Milla Jovovich to providing such a &#x27;realistic&#x27; portrayal
of the times, emotions, unswerving drive and FAITH surrounding the
enigmatic and legendary character of Jean D&#x27;Arc,&#x85; I almost followed her
into the battles and confrontations with the Church !!!<br /><br />The screenplay was almost exactly as has been described in the book
&#x22;The Mystery of Joan of Arc&#x22; written by the Frenchman, LEON DENIS.
Translated into English by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,(1924) and in which
the following message from Jean D&#x27;Arc is given:<br /><br />Sweet is the communion with those who love our Lord and Father even as
I do. I am not saddened by the vision of the past, for it draws me to
you, and my remembrance of my communion with the holy dead makes me the
sister and the comrade of all those to whom God has granted the favour
of knowing the secret of life and death. I return thanks to God for
permitting me to draw close to you, and to tell who know a little that
the lives which God gives us must be used wisely if we are to be in His
grace. All life should be sweet and welcome which enables us to do the
task assigned to us by the All-powerful Father and Judge. We should
bless all that comes from His hand. He has always chosen the weak to
carry out His plans, for He can give strength to the lamb, even as He
promised. He brings truth under the most changing forms, but all cannot
understand His purpose. Submissive to His laws and trying to follow
them, I have not always understood them. I knew, however, that the
sweet counsels which He gave me could not be the work of an enemy, and
the comfort which they have always given me has been a stay in trouble
and a heart&#x27;s joy. I never knew what was the deeper design of the Lord.
He hid from me in all His messages the dreadful end which I was to
endure, having pity on my weakness and on my shrinking from pain, but
when the time did come, He gave me strength and courage. I love to
think of the hours when first I heard the voices. I cannot say that I
was afraid. I was greatly astonished to find myself the subject of the
Divine Mercy. I knew instantly that they were the messengers of God,
and I felt a great sweetness in my heart whilst the holy voice rang in
my ears. It is not possible for me to tell you exactly how I felt, for
I could not describe the deep peace and joy, so that when they ceased I
felt that I was the child of God and of Heaven. I feebly comprehended
that their will should be mine, but though overjoyed at their coming, I
was surprised at the orders they gave and feared a little to execute
them. It did certainly seem a fine work to save our France, but how was
a girl to go among men-at-arms? Finally, in their sweet and constant
companionship I came to have more confidence in myself, and the love
which I had ever had for God guided my conduct, for it cannot be right
to rebel against the will of a Father. It was a hard task, and yet I
had joy in obeying, and I set forth to do the Will of God. I am happy
that I followed His orders, and I pardon those who were the instruments
of my death, for I know that it was not out of hatred for my spirit
that they set it free, but because they hated the work that I had done.
This work had been blessed by God, and, therefore, they were deeply in
the wrong, but, like them, I have no hatred for their spirits. I am
only the enemy of all that God condemns, or falseness and wickedness.
It is their work which is evil. They return to it ever, but the
remembrance of their past cannot be effaced by them. I mourn for the
hatreds which they have encouraged among those who should be brothers,
and for the evil weeds which they have sown in the Church, which have
caused this Mother whom I once cherished to devote herself rather to
theology than to charity. It is pleasing to me to see that they improve
and admit to some extent their error, but things have never been as I
should have wished them, and my love for the Church turns more and more
away from this ancient guide of souls in order to give itself more
completely to our sweet and gracious Lord.&#x22; JEHANNE.
