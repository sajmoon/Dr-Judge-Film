Messenger... French born director got tricks enough to make a good movie: a
lot of money, a good casting (including Besson' Ukrainian wife top model
Milla Jovovich), good decor and natural locations, costumes, sound, special
and visual effects, stunts, location managers and a large crew (the film is
a big joint production with participation of two countries and many people).
This movie, called in Spain &quot;Juana de Arco de Luc Besson&quot;, has got a good
photography in color too. But let me said just one thing. There was
excessive and illustrious cinematographic preceding about the Orleans&acute;Maid.
It is inevitable for cinema fans remind previous versions (the Dreyer one,
Fleming, Bresson, Preminger...). It was not easy to get a product of similar
quality because they are masterpieces written with gold letters at Story of
Cinema. The results of this ambitious movie are, in my opinion, nearer of
Dutch Paul Verhoeven' Los Se&ntilde;ores del Acero filmed in Spain in 1985 than
Danish Carl T. Dreyer' La passion de Jeanne D'Arc (1928).
