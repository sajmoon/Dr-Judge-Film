I do affirm it, the girl is an Actress, and death upon those who think of
her as a pin up! She conveys emotions with impressive easiness, she
COMMUNICATES. Hoffmann is great as usual. Directing, too, is very good, but
everything is nearly flawless in this movie. Maybe they saved some money in
the battle scenes, realistic as in Braveheart but not equally sumptuous. But
if it was a billion dollars movie, it would have been a Hollywood flick and
you might have forgotten the pregnant bergmanian dialogues of Jean with her
conscience.
