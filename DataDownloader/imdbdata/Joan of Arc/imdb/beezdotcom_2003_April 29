This was a watchable enough movie, I guess, but Milla Jovovich looks
NOTHING
like Joan Van Ark.  John Malkovich plays a lousy Gary Ewing, and I don't
know what old France has to do with Knots Landing.<br /><br />Before you attempt to correct me, and tell me that this movie was supposed
to be about Joan OF ARC, stop and think, &quot;whose life is represented more
historically accurately by this movie?&quot; - and then I think you'll arrive
at
the same conclusion that I did.
