Yes, the media criticisms were quibbles.  Yes, Milla was spellbinding, and
Besson was exactly the right maniac for the job.  Yes, it was the
heartthumpinest, goosebumpinest, throatlumpinest entertainment I'd seen in
a
long while, and, yes, it was also a believable and tactful take on the
perfection of one person's faith.  In fact, it was a four-star effort all
around, except that......Joan didn't have an older sister, much less one
who
was murdered by the English, and that matters.
Mark Twain said that Joan's was the first, and so far the only, biography
made under oath.  Her family roster is not one of the areas the court
record
leaves blank.  Best guess is that Joan was a saint.  Second best is that
she
was a total loopster.  If you elect to pursue a third possibility, that
she
was driven by a traumatic subconscious agenda, then you need a plausible
trauma, one that doesn't contravene the record.  Otherwise, you're just
getting it wrong.
Does this really big error in storytelling judgment wreck the movie?
Remember, we're not talking &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;.  Joan changed the world.  Sounds
like
a discussion question to me.
