This movie was horrible!  Here's what was wrong with it:<br /><br />1. Millie Jovovich is really good looking but she's no Joan of Arc, she
can't even act like her!  Gawd, it was so painful to watch her try to play
out this part that was so beyond her.  Seems to me that the real Joan of
Arc
would have a little more self confidence than this one did, I mean she had
to have an army follow her.  The part where she was panting while she was
riding her horse was laughable.  She does best in movies where she doesn't
have to talk.  And I liked her in the 5th element too.<br /><br />I mean Joan of Arc was this really history changing person who did what
noone even dreamed about and this movie makes her look like a total dork.
Even the title p***es me off..the messenger. And all through the movie
she's
whining, &quot;I'm only the messenger&quot;.  I really don't think that was how it
happened, Joan of Arc had to have had a very strong personality, not a
childish one or noone would have listened to her!<br /><br />2. The lines were so bad.......hello, since when did they use American
slang
in the 1400's in France?  Yargh, it was so stuuuupid!<br /><br />3. Gross.  The rape scene was unrealistic and disgusting, it turned my
stomach.  I didn't feel comfortable watching the rest of the movie after
that.  Since when does someone die immediately after being stabbed in the
stomach?  And do you really think he would rape her while she was pinned
through the stomach to a wooden door and dead?  Nice touch...NOT!<br /><br />Seems like someone making this movie really got a kick out of it
though...that's the really gross part.<br /><br />4. I didn't buy John Malkovich as the King, I didn't buy Faye Dunaway as
Yolande D'Aragon these actors were miscast.  They both are so overused in
movies and it's like, &quot;Oh, here's John M. playing Charles II&quot;  Instead of,
&quot;Charles the II was played by John M.&quot;.  Yawn.  John M. is so over exposed
and so predictable, I knew exactly how he would act and he did...  Also
wasn't John M. a bit old to play the part????<br /><br />5. Slowness....I didn't even watch the whole thing, it made me tired
watching Milli trying to act like an actress, so I turned it off and went
to
bed.<br /><br />Hey, Dustin Hoffman was pretty good though!  But that's no
surprise.<br /><br />Don't rent this dog, and if someone gives it to you free I wouldn't even
bother watching it, it belongs in the garbage.  I'm just sorry that Milla
Jovonich didn't do better, I think she should take acting classes or
something.
