1999_November 19 

This movie started with great promise.  The child who played Jeanne as a
little girl was marvelous.  The scenes of her world falling apart, her
sister's horrendous death, moved me almost to tears.  Then, suddenly, this
promising movie took a turn for the worse.  Milla Jovovich, I think, may
have have some raw talent, and she is certainly a beautiful young woman.
However, she is not at the point yet where she can carry an entire movie;
particularly one of such magnitude as this one.  Ms. Jovovich would do much
better to take supporting roles in future films while she hones her talent.
She is only setting herself up for career disaster by attempting something
like this before she is ready.<br /><br />I found that rather than admiring this character for her unwavering faith
in
God and her own personal strength, I felt sorry for her.  She was portrayed
as quite mentally disturbed, not driven by the spirit of God by by madness.
I could see no reason in the world why the French armies would follow
her--Jovovich was unpersuasive in the role.<br /><br />The pity is that clearly much work and money went into the making of this
movie.  The sets, the costumes, everything was clearly done with much care
and attention to detail.  I won't go quite so far as to say it was
terrible;
but do yourself a favor and wait for videotape to get this one.....and rent
it on dollar day.
