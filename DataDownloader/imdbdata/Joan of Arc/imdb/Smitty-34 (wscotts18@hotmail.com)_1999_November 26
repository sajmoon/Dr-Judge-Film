1999_November 26 

I recently rented the TV mini-series (because I had seen the trailer for the
Luc Besson film and at the time thought I had missed the big screen
release), and to some degree that may have corrupted my feelings toward the
Besson film. Two interpretations of the same person and events - there's
bound to be differences. First of all, I liked the TV version but I felt
there was something missing. That Joan was presented more softly - more
&quot;heavenly&quot;. The battle scenes were milder (for TV) and the representations
of her visions a little more clearer and spiritual. After seeing Besson's
version I see that production as more a fantasylike/romantic representation.<br /><br />I think Besson captured the passionate/fanatical/driven side of Joan of Arc.
I think his versions of the visions while they focussed more on Christ and
were somewhat confusing, they were probably more accurate to the confusion
he felt. The viewer isn't as led by the hand as in the TV release.<br /><br />It took me a while to get into Milla Jovovich as Joan. She seemed one
dimensional initially but then as the film moved on her intensity grows and
enables her to portray the 'on the fringe of lunacy' behavior of Joan with
conviction. Did the soldiers follow her because they believed in her? or
because they were afraid? Different from the Leelee Sobieski character
because Leelee's Joan seemed more sure, and less intense, less fanatical and
less a warrior.<br /><br />Most of the supporting cast in Besson's were convincing. Faye Dunaway gave a
good performance as the 'use her then lose her' step mother - quite devious.
The scenes with Dustin Hoffman as her conscience were brilliant. She is
wrestling with herself trying to understand if what she did and believed
were really Gods bidding or her own desire for revenge - Milla really
outdoes herself here - locked up in a cage by your lonesome can really do a
number on you - you are your own worst judge. This is really where the film
leaps to Award winning levels. She wavers on the me or God issue evidenced
by her signing the form that says essentially she is a heretic betraying God
to save herself (repent to the Church), then renegs realizing what she has
done.<br /><br />This film was outstanding. More realistic than the mini-series. The 'Saving
Private Ryan' attitude toward the battles removes the romance from the
typical portrayals of mediaeval hand to hand fighting. Yes folks a dirty
sword when swung with two hands can remove heads, arms and legs. Most of all
though Besson leaves you to answer the questions yourself. Was Joan sent by
God to have France's 'rightful' head annointed to the throne or was she a
bloody lunatic following her misinterpretations of a lucid dream.<br /><br />Would you rather be led by the hand or find your way yourself?
8/10
