The film has been sadly underestimated. Viewers possibly expected another
film like La Femme Nikita or a battle epic. Besson has done a truly
European
film that presents more questions than it gives answers. Was Joan really a
divine Messenger? Was she possessed? Can possession be of God or is it
always of the Devil? How does a person earn the right to be a Messenger?
How
does a person lose that right? Does the fall of Joan begin when she first
enjoyed the battle and the taste of blood? Or does it begin even earlier
as
a sin of pride? Who condemned Joan: the tribunal or she herself? Who
visited
her in prison: God or Satan?The film gives no straight answers and it
shouldn't. The great merit of the film is that it makes the viewer think,
which unfortunately is unusual nowadays. Besson has done his best film so
far.
