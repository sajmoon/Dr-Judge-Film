What can I say, many have criticized this film and I believe they've done so
unjustly.  This gem is easily one of the best movies of 1999.  The drama is
intense and the story is incredible.  To think a teenage girl could persuade
her government to do anything is unimaginable much less to convince the
leaders to go to war!  Do yourself a favor and pick up the Region 2 French
DVD release of this film and enjoy this near masterpiece in all its DTS
glory!
