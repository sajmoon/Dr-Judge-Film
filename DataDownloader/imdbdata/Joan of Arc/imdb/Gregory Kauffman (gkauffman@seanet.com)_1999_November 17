1999_November 17 
<br /><br />Having seen this film last night, I am surprised at the abuse it has taken
from critics and friends who have seen it before me.  It is said to be
over-long and boring most often.<br /><br />I disagree.  If you are heading out to see an action movie you will be
disappointed.  This script, in many ways, belongs on the stage.  It is
true
that it is overwritten slightly for film, but it is full of ideas.  The
central conflict here is not between Joan and the English.  Nor Joan and a
treacherous church and king.  But between Joan and her
doubts.<br /><br />A friend turned to me after the film and said, &quot;She was crazy.&quot; Which
brought to mind another brilliant dichotomy played by the filmmakers.
What
is the line between inspiration or madness?  Who can say?  Imagine a young
girl suddenly inspired with the idea of who things must be.  Would she not
believe such inspiration came from God and would she not believe that she
had been spoken to?  Too often we see inspiration and call it madness, or
ruthlessness, or insensitivity.<br /><br />I think the film was brilliant.  And Milla Jovovich delivered an inspired
and most impressive performance.
