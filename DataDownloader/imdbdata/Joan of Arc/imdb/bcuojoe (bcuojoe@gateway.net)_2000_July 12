Poor, poor Milla...Stuck in an ugly, boring &quot;epic&quot; of minscule proportions.
Yes indeed, the new film by Luc Besson is a poor hodgepodge of gruesome
battles and tacky humour, a downer since I loved most of his
films.
In &quot;Messenger:story of Joan of Arc&quot;, the charector of Joan as played by
Milla(of 'Fifth Element' fame) is a screaming psycho twit. She flails her
sword around her like a baton and squeals mild curses to those who take the
lords' name in vain. There is'nt a bit of subtlety in her horrid
performance, which is a flaw the whole film lacks. Everything in this film
is loud, crude and seriously lacking in the taste department. The technical
aspects of the film are just as weak, only hinting at what a great action
film this could've been. If only the film were as great as its
preview...(which had me drooling for weeks beforehand) Instead I was
bombarded by poor dialogue, a story that stunk of manure and poor acting ALL
around.
SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!<br /><br />-6 out of 10<br /><br />
