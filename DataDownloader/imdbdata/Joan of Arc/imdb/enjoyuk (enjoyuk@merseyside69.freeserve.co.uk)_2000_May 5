2000_May 5 

I will start off by saying that 'The Messenger' or 'Joan of Arc' (as it is
known in the UK) was a solid piece of entertainment.
Milla Jovovich was brilliant as Joan and the camera work was dazzling.  I
did feel the movie was terribly let down by the following flaws
though:<br /><br />A) I cannot believe for a second that 15th Century soldiers used to shout
things like 'Go F*** yourself' or the numerous other 20th century phrases &amp;
vulgarities used throughout the film.  I feel it just hinders the
authenticity of the story.<br /><br />B) Why on earth did half of the French people in the movie speak with
English accents, at times I didnt know who was fighting who, I am sure that
Mr. Besson could have cast some French actors in the roles.<br /><br />C) The writers did really go over the top with making every Englishman in
the story to be the most evil person alive.  Im sure that we were bad back
then, but to portray every English person as snarling, torturers &amp;
rapists... give me a break.<br /><br />Gripes aside, I must say I was very entertained by the film, but I couldnt
help to wonder what the movie COULD have been like in the hands of another
director. (Sorry Luc)<br /><br />(The version I saw was the International version).
