2003_December 2 

I have seen the movie twice within a week, and will see it a couple of
more
times. I was shivering through the whole movie, it was so real for me. ...
how 'clean' Joan was. First, at the beginning of the film it turns out
that
she had been to the priest for the third time that day, to confess. Later
on
the knights do not understand her when she says 'I want to confess. I have
not confessed ... today yet' - if you really pay attention, for the
environment this is very strange. And, at the end of the movie, she
confesses her 'crimes' again. What I want to point out that she had a very
strong conscience and she intended to keep it clean. This makes her a
candidate to be Saint - as she was given this title 500 years
later.<br /><br />This movie IS about reality, the betraying of Joan included. This is what
I
liked the most (the film being so real).<br /><br />Further on, every split second of the movie is communicating something. If
you watch closely, the faces, the looks of the actors, the music, are
constantly telling you a part of the story, a message. Perfect timing
features the cutting of this film. The conflicts are precisely designed.
The
actors are perfectly matching their roles. I admit, that the ending is a
bit
long, but basically it stresses the suppressive behavior of the
inquisition
of that time.<br /><br />Milla plays just perfectly. In this version of the Joan of Arc movies she
is
what she is and that is it. Luc Besson had an idea in mind and she
realizes
it.<br /><br />If you like Luc Besson, Milla Jovovich, Eric Serra, history, middle age,
or
if you are a rebel, this is a must for you.<br /><br />The more you appreciate art the more you are going to like this movie.<br /><br />Finally: this movie is fine art in itself, a classic piece. But you have
to
like the style Luc Besson paints...
