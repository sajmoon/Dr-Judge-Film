Milla Jovovich is a good looking young woman, that's for sure, but she's
definitely not the right actress for playing Joan Of Arc. I'm not
impressed
by her performance and the religious dimension of this movie is very weak.
Some scenes like the battle of Orleans and the coronation in Reims among
others are very spectacular, but Luc Besson's movie looks too modern for a
medieval epic.
