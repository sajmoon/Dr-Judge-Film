This is simply one of the most awful films I have ever seen, alongside
Armageddon.  Beyond &quot;hammy&quot; performances, totally unbelievable, yet
brilliantly shot.  No fault of the director but the writing is awful.  As
always Malcovich is class but Milla is uniquely over dramatic and totally
unbelievable. Ok, I'm English so you would expect some bias but save
yourselves 151 minutes of this!  Trust me.
