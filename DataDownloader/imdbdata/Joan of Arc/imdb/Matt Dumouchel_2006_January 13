From start to end, the Messenger, director Luc Besson's bio-pic of Joan
of Arc is a beautiful mixture for the senses. From the eyes of a child,
to the horrors of war, there is little that Besson fails to blend some
artistic merit to. This beauty, combined with an intriguing screenplay,
make the movie worth watching.<br /><br />Of great importance is the realization that this movie does not attempt
to tell you exactly what happened to Joan of Arc. What it intelligently
does it give you biography of her life through her own eyes. We are
left to interpret things as only Joan would have. There is no absolute
truth to the messages she receives. There is no &quot;hand of God&quot; pushing
her along; there are simply whispers.<br /><br />I found this film most intriguing as it simply does not fall in line
with other historical epics in recent decades. Films like Alexander and
Troy should have learned a thing or two from a film like the Messenger.
It is a truly beautiful film, both on the outside and the inside. There
are characters, both leading and supporting, that however small a part
they play, are significant and memorable.<br /><br />Like all of Luc Besson's films, the film possesses a strong individual
identity. This is anything but conventional &quot;Hollywood&quot;. I highly
suggest you give it a look.
