Everyone's saying how horrible Milla was in this picture.  I feel it
necessary to remind those people that Milla was simply acting out a script
that was given to her by someone else.  She was someone else's version of
Joan.  Do people think that she simply showed up on the set everyday and
made up her lines as she went?  No.  As I said before, she was given a
script.  Someone else's interpretation of Joan.  And I think that she did a
fantastic job with what she had.  She portrayed Joan the way she was
supposed to.  I think that Milla is a wonderful actress.  I also think that
people are getting her Joan mixed up with the Joan they have in their
heads.
The truth is, no one really knows Joan's true personality, so it's totally
open to speculation.  You can think that Joan was similar to the Leelee
version or closer to Milla's Joan, or you can think that she was somewhere
in between, like I do.  In any case, all this to say that you shouldn't
knock Milla's performance because she did do a great job with the the
material given to her, you have to admit.
