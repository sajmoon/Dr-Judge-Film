Essentially this is a miserable failure of an attempt to duplicate the
medieval magic of Braveheart -- except it happens in France, and the hero
is
a jibbering, confused, semi-delusional woman-child who never really seems
to
know what's going on.<br /><br />You know the writing is bad when 15th century characters use words like
&quot;gonna&quot; (and yes, it's actually subtitled that way on the DVD, too). None
of
the characters were developed, and thus you never really got to know or
care
about any of them.<br /><br />Milla's portrayal of Joan of Arc is completely uninspiring, thanks to the
lousy writing, and she pretty much runs around the whole time like a
confused chicken with her head cut off. Malkovich is equally unconvincing
as
the Dauphin/King of France. And due to his inability to affect anything
but
his own wimpy version of the Southern California  dialect, Dustin Hoffman
has no business playing a medieval role. Faye Dunaway is the only one of
the
major actors whose performance I felt was acceptable.<br /><br />Overall, a potentially good concept is ruined by Besson's lack of
understanding that you can't translate 15th century French and English
into
20th century colloquial American without throwing believability out the
window. Imagine an episode of Xena, Warrior Princess where a wild-eyed
Xena
hallucinates more than she fights, and you have the gist of this movie. I
give it a 3 out of 10.
