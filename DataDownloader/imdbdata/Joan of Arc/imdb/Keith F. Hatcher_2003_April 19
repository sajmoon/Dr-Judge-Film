<br /><br />Ever since 1899 the Maid of Orl&eacute;ans has been the subject of all kinds of
films, most of which are hazardous incursions into make-believe, but only
a
couple of which have been more or less historical attempts at being
accurate.<br /><br />This film ventures into the blown-up tremendism so beloved by US
audiences,
and ends up being an unpalatable &quot;action flick&quot; with lots of effects and
lots of stunts and lots of blood, Ms Jovovich destroying medieval English
armies single-handed.<br /><br />Luc Besson should have known better; next time he should try it with an
all-European cast and film it in the beatiful valley of the River Loire,
and
adhere more strictly to historical facts easily available in any Parisian
archive.<br /><br />Forget this rowdy commercialised nonsense, and try another version made
the
same year:<br /><br />Joan of Arc (1999/I) (TV)...aka Jeanne d'Arc (1999/II) (TV) (Canada:
French title)<br /><br />with Leelee Sobieski and Jacqueline Bisset helped along by -
unbelievably -
Peter O'Toole and Shirley MacLaine, in a much more intimist and
historically
contextualised version.
