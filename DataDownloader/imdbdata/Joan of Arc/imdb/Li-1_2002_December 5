4 out of 10<br /><br />French Braveheart with a woman is what a lot of people are going to think of
when they hear the historical premise.  This is actually the only film I've
ever seen that focused on the life and death of Joan of Arc, so there's not
much for me to compare to.  As for the historical facts, I know little other
than the fact she was under the age of twenty when she lead the French army
against the English and was eventually burned at the stake.<br /><br />As a movie on its own, it's not particularly good, marred heavily by
director Luc Besson's overuse of wide-angled cinematography that's probably
more fitting for Monty Python than a serious drama.  Pretentious imagery is
all over the map, with unintentionally hiliarious scenes of Jesus Christ
speaking to Joan, shouting &quot;What are you doing to me, Jeanne?&quot;  On the
bright side, the battle scenes are good, the performances are decent (though
Milla Jovovich kind of overdoes her part), and there's only great scene
where Dustin Hoffman (as the &quot;Conscience&quot;) speculates where Joan could have
gotten her sword from (you'll understand when you see it).
