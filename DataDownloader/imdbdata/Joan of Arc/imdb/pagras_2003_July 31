I saw a comment that said that if Joan of Arc could see this movie, she
would turn in her grave (if she had some). I must fully agree with it.
Although I am no Joan's biographer, the facts that I know from her life
were
so deformed here that I wonder why Frenchmen didn't burn the director on a
stockpile instead of her. By the way, I must laugh, when I remember the
concealment around the filming of Besson's Joan in northern Moravia. No
man
including Martians could get there. Why did they actually hide there?
Perhaps they wanted to keep back from people, what a trash they are just
shooting.<br /><br />Besson and his exwife allegedly undertook a deep investigation (only Gods
know, where) and this French-Ukrainian collaboration resulted in a title,
where Joan of Arc is &quot;demythicized&quot; and depicted as a furious psychotic,
who
runs through the screen with a staring look and even beats her soldiers
with
a fist (yes, here it is really possible). Poor villagers at the trial in
Rouen probably lied and Besson with Jovovich revealed a big historical
fraud. One thing that I can't understand is why there are so many people
that can call this unbelievable garbage &quot;a moving masterpiece&quot;. Maybe
there
is a lot of ignorants, who know nothing about the historical reality and
maybe they have only a foggy idea about the position of France, but
despite
that I can't believe that somebody could think that French soldiers could
follow a lunatic like this.<br /><br />I am very sorry for director Marshall, who also planned a movie about
Joan,
but he was probably forced to put off its realization because of this
silly
emanation that was quicker. The Joan with Leelee Sobieski was certainly
better, but Leelee simply lacks enough charisma (Although otherwise she is
a
very pretty and sympathetic girl, of course.)<br /><br />Maybe Besson will soon make a similar biographical movie about Mother
Theresa, where he will definitively demythicize her as a deviant monster
abusing little Indian children. I am looking forward to positive comments
on
this exciting masterpiece.
