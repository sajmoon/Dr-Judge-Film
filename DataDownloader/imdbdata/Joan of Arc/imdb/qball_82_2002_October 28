This movie is just painful.  I got halfway through and I had to stop
watching.  The dialogue is pure schmalz, as is half the imagery.  The
opening montage of the girl running through the flowers made me want to
gag.<br /><br />But the lowest note of this movie?  The laughable (and cringe-worthy..)
acting by Milla Jovovich.  She rages through this movie like a mad woman
possessed, she tends to scream and glare at the camera a lot.  To be
brutally honest, she's more suited to roles where she doesn't have to speak
much and just has to look pretty, like in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;.<br /><br />If you want a fulfilling movie experience about Joan of Arc, I highly
recommend the TV-movie version starring Leelee Sobieski.<br /><br />
