1999_October 12 

Although controversial as history, this film is very well designed and
produced. It is engaging in its presentation, delightful in its
photography.
It is designed to raise questions: and the viewer's answer will say much
about the viewer. Was she sent by God? Does God speak to people directly?
Did she believe in what she said? The truth is that others did, and that
is
what led to the historical impact of her life. This movie does credit as
an
ode to the power of one person. The violence is a little graphic at times,
but not overwhelming. Otherwise it is very good for people of all
ages.
