This film is a historical portrayal of the famous story of Joan of Arc,
a young girl who pretends to be a man so she can fight in war. Joan
believes that she is being driven by God, and the film portrays her
devout religious visions that enable her to want to fight the English.
As the famous story goes, it is not a very happy ending for Joan. This
is a pretty good film, although it is slow in places and a lot of the
religious visions could have been edited out, and this would not have
subtracted from the story at all. The cinematography was also done
well, and the different camera angles and general use of the camera
helped to understand Joan and her feelings. It's a good historical
picture, but it is a long film to sit through, and it could have been
edited further.
