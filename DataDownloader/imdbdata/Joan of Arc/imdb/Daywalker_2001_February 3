2001_February 3 

Because of reading so much bad critics in various magazines, I avoided to
watch this film at the cinema. Finally I borrowed it on video and I must
say, that it&acute;s no masterpiece like &quot;L&eacute;on&quot;, but it&acute;s much better than the
heavily overrated &quot;The 5th Element&quot;. It seems that director Luc Besson was
occupied in the first place to put his wife Milla Jovovich on a show. And,
yes, she&acute;s really convincing as the French heroine and saint. An other great
performance is given by Dustin Hoffman, whose appearance gives this movie a
very mystical touch. However, other international stars like John Malkovich
or Faye Dunaway seem to be not fully stretched in their roles and the battle
scenes are sometimes a little bit badly choreographed. To make an inevitable
comparison with other movies of this kind, I would say that &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; is
not as good as &quot;Braveheart&quot;, but it has got much more values than &quot;The
Patriot&quot;. (7/10)
