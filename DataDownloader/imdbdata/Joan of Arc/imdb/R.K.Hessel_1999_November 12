The Messenger (The Story of Joan of Arc)
The Messenger speaks truth unlike the majority of films we are being
confronted with as a result of the factory-like production of moving
pictures. Joan as a youngster hears voices, which are obviously the voices
we can all hear if we really listen. If you don't believe in that statement
don't read any further. In her youthful naivete she equates those voices
that understandably seem supernatural in the world she lived in and we now
live in. When most people cast those voices away, her voices take the
forefront in her life through a set of difficult circumstances. To me films
like Fight Club and The Thin Red Line deal with exactly the same issue &#150;
exactly. Being in touch with these inner `messages' gives her access to
truth as best as a human will ever know it. She is inherently a good person
just as we all are when we're born. With her worldly belief in the
structures and reality that the church represents &#150; she has made an
assumption that her voices are truly God's will. Her obvious conviction in
her inner `messages' are so convincing and intoxicating to everyone that is
in her presence, even her perceived enemies, that `Joan the peasant girl'
has the capability to lead an entire army (not that she cares about that
status beyond a vehicle for truth). People sense that this person has no
hidden agendas or ties with traditional means of gaining power or status or
money &#150; she fights for what she believes in &#150; and its overcoming. It's an
absolutely beautiful film and a work of art from Luc Besson and his team,
not in the spirit of they'll do anything to put a different spin on Joan
but
to give a genuine perspective that is unique &#150; even without knowing every
little detail on Joan of Arc the film speaks truth. They are to be
commended. I simply couldn't hold back my tears at certain points of the
film. I would like to see this film be embraced by the money giving mass
audiences but I'm afraid that won't happen &#150; again not unlike Fight Club or
The Thin Red Line. But for me if there were not films like the ones I've
mentioned then the world would be a darker lonelier place to live
in.
