1999_November 5 

I got a chance to see this film at a special advance screening in Los
Angeles, and as a fan of Luc Besson and of history, I was properly blown
away.<br /><br />Luc Besson's affinity for color and motion-a penchant that elevates his `La
Femme Nikita' and `The Professional' to among the best action films of all
time-now focuses his lens on the passionate history of St. Joan of Arc.
Besson thrills us with his visuals, plunging his audience right into the
heart of the tale &#133; from the tempest of Joan's horrifying visions, to the
courts of Charles VII, to the filth and carnage of the horrifying Battle of
Orl&eacute;ans.<br /><br />Besson, always one to skirt controversy, takes an uncalculated risk by
depicting Joan as the troubled teenager she is, subtly equating her
disturbing visions with the trauma of post-pubescent change.  Joan, played
brilliantly by Milla Jovovich, roars through extreme emotional states
ranging from breathless terror to barbarous passion.  Such profound mood
swings may ring with eerie familiarity to those audience members who've
dealt with distressed teenagers.<br /><br />Some critics have found fault with this interpretation of St. Joan, but I
assert that such a depiction allows audiences to immediately empathize with
the Maid's torment.  Too easy would it be to paint a flat, two-dimensional
warrior who comes by her skills naturally.  How much more realistic is it to
see her struggle with her Divine Calling, even come to hate the voices that
compel her into battle.  This embodies Joan with sympathetic traits, and
teens especially will identify with her isolation and issues of abandonment.<br /><br />Jovovich's standout performance is complimented by strong dramatic turns
from many fine actors: John Malkovich as the foppish and self-important
Charles VII; Faye Dunaway as Charle's treacherous stepmother, Yolanda D'
Aragon, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo (so brilliant as Bob in `La Femme Nikita') as Dunois, a
mighty French soldier who comes to trust and rely upon Joan; and the
outstanding Dustin Hoffman, in a tour-d&eacute;-force performance, as Joan's
surreal Conscience, ominously forcing Joan's hand when she must  confront
the reality of her visions.<br /><br />Among the great historical dramas of the 1990s, only a handful standout as
masterpieces; `Braveheart,' `Schindler's List,' and `Saving Private Ryan'
immediately come to mind.  `The Messenger,' while not as powerful as these
films, can easily take its place among their ranks, perhaps the most honest
portrayal of St. Joan's life that we have seen.
