1999_November 23 

The acting is great but the story makes Joan of Arc really crazy. I really
enjoy Milla Jovovich's acting, singing and modeling career. Dustin Hoffman
makes a scary dude in a black robe. What is up with the big foreheads on the
women who were big hats? I think I enjoyed the mini series on CBS a little
better then the one on the big screen. I think it made it like a big joke on
the big screen. The story line made it go nuts. Which movie to
believe?
