1999_November 7 

It took a while before the film really got started. Skipping the long intro
portraiting Joan's youth. Once Milla entered the picture the film became
truly enjoyable. What a performance. Although we get to see some of the
battles, it is truly Joan that remains the center of the story. Some may
want to have seen more battle scenes, consider that this is not an action
movie. The story tells about beliefs, faith and religion. It doesn't answer
the question if Joan was truly blessed or victim of her own imaginations.
That is something you as a viewer are left to ponder on. The confrontation
with her own conscience at the end is the real highlight of the
movie.<br /><br />Of course everyone knows the story and how it will end eventually, that
should certainly not keep you from seeing it.<br /><br />9/10
