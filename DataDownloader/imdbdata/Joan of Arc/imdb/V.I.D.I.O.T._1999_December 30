1999_December 30 

This film was torture.  As the film was wrapping up, I was still waiting
for
it to begin, hoping against hope that the creator of Nikita, Leon, and The
Fifth Element would finally show his face.  But this must have just been
simply a paint-by-numbers job for Besson.  There was no inspiration, no
magic.  My disappointment was only aggravated by the fact that I'd been
eagerly anticipating this next pairing of Besson &amp; Jovovich, who had
created
some memorable (if at times a bit too silly) moments in The Fifth Element.
The film starts with a bad sign - a long rolling expositional text,
apparently filling in with words what Besson (the creator of some of my
recent favorite film visuals) could not express in pictures.  And when we
first see Milla's Joan (in an understated and confusingly out-of sequence
introduction), she is utterly overwhelmed, teary-eyed and whispery as she
meets her Dauphin.  She then goes on to remain utterly overwhelmed,
teary-eyed and whispery for the rest of the film.  It's as if she followed
some bad advice and took her finest moment in The Fifth Element (when she
breaks down while learning about &quot;War&quot;), and turned it into an entire
movie's worth of acting.  There are no valleys to her performance, by which
we can clearly notice any sudden emotional peaks.  She's just always
completely intense and on edge, and it makes for a tiresome viewing
experience.  The only parts of the film that I found in any way
entertaining
were after Tcheky Karyo showed up, and the film could engage in that
playful
male / female / soldier camaraderie previously shown in G.I. Jane (which
coincidentally featured a prominent Joan Of  Arc comparison in its
trailers).  Then Karyo suddenly disappears from the film without a word,
and
with him went any caring I had for any of the characters.  I can't say it
was a badly-made film, just a horrid waste of time if you are anticipating
a
return to the past magic of Besson.
