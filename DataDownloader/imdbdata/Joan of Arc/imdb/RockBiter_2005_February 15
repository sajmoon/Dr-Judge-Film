Did Besson cop out by not taking a clear stand on whether or not Joan
of Arc was inspired by God or not? The use of Dustin Hoffman's
&quot;presence&quot; in this film seemed to me to be Besson's own musings about
the fifteenth-century French peasant girl. 'Maybe she was, maybe she
wasn't'. Overall an excellent portrayal nevertheless. The two most
powerful images in the film were undoubtedly: - the first time that
Joan impatiently takes her own Communion and pours the dark red wine
into her mouth too fast and it spills down her chin - the scene from
above where Joan is lying in the tall grass of the meadow with her arms
spread out (as if in a representation of Christ on the cross) and a
gleaming sword is seen in the grass just off from her outstretched
hand. I had CHILLS all over when I saw this. Definitely an IMAGE gem
from Besson!
