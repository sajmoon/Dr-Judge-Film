2000_January 25 

This movie is still a Luc Besson movie but it is was much influenced by
the
Hollywood style. Though it is principally a story in the french national
history it was nevertheless americanized &agrave; la &quot;Braveheart&quot;. I liked many
things in it, especially the pictures, they still have the fascinating
style
of Luc in many scenes. Concerning the actors I think that Milla Jovovich
was
not suitable for this role. She was too soft for it. Perhaps a french
actress would have been more suitable! The other interesting aspect of
this
movie was the interpretation of the visions and the role of her
&quot;conscience&quot;. It was free to the interpretation whether these visions were
from god or just hallucinations! Movies and arts in general should have
enough room for fantasy like in this film.
In short this movie is worth seeing, although I could imagine different
reactions about it especially in Europe.
