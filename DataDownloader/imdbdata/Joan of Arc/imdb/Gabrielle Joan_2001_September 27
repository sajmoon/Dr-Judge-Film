When I heard about this movie, I was very willing to see it. So I did.
Unfortunately, I just did not like it.<br /><br />I expected much more from a story about a heroine. This Joan of Arc did not
even come close. The biggest problem with this movie, I think, is the
casting. For example, throughout the entire movie, I wanted to tell Milla
Jovovich to calm down, because she seemed so uptight all the time. I had
always imagined Joan as being an emotionally strong woman. Milla Jovovich
would have done much better as a damsel in distress.<br /><br />I did, however, like Dustin Hoffman's performance. His role was very
interesting in the way it was presented in the movie. It was certainly one
of the film's stronger points.<br /><br />I will admit that the costumes and scenery were quite good, but the story
left much to be desired. The dialogue was shallow. I also did not see the
need for so much unnecessary gore.<br /><br />I think this movie had the potential to be much better.
