I study history alot, and nothing bothers me more if they try to dramatize a
movie and change history; or do some politically correct revisions to a
story that make it unrealistic that I find the movie very cheesie.  This
movie does neither, its a real life story of incredible historical events
that need no changes or the movie would lose its flavor.  Except this film
cuts stuff out due to time constraints, which is understandable.  This film
follows closely the Joan of Arc story, and does it on a believable budget,
with incredible actors.  (Hoffman, Malcovich)  The makers did alot of
research into the film, with the weapons and tactics used in those times,
and how Joan historically handled herself with much faith, grace, and noble
manner.  Joan played a realistic, holy person, not a hollywood Rambo.  It is
a great film of faith and insperation, and I can watch it over and over
again.  P S Hoffman plays a great role as the Devil, I will never forget his
cameo.
