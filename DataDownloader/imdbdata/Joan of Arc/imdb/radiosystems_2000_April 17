2000_April 17 

After keeping an open mind and avoiding reading reviews before watching
it,
I was deeply disappointed in the &quot;The Messenger&quot;.  With the likes of
Hoffman,
Malkovich, and the up and coming Milla Jovovich, I was expecting an above
average epic tale along the lines of a Braveheart. What I found was a
hollow, rather disjointed story that left me wondering how could a story
with this much potential fail so badly. The talented John Malkovich's
character of the Dauphin was especially hollow.  Dustin Hoffman character
&quot;the conscience&quot; comes out of no where and seems out of place at best.
Milla's Joan was by far the the best performance of the group, but not
enough to carry the entire movie. Even the battle scenes had an
unrealistic
feel. For example Joan's numerous lone charges of well defended English
positions while the English seem to almost pause and wait for her to get
in
position while not even firing one arrow.  Yes, she does eventually get
wounded, but the way it comes off was no where near the realism felt in
classic epic battles in &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Private Ryan&quot;, of Kadokawa's
&quot;Heaven
and Earth&quot;. I also felt the mood and mannerisms of the characters felt
more
modern than 15th century Europe.  If you are looking for another
Braveheart,
save your disappointment.
