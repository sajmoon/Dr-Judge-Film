The thing that bothered me the most in this film, was the fact that Joan's
hair changed colour so many times. sure, a trivial matter. but did they
have
hair dye in those days? i don't think so. when she's a little girl, her
hair
is brown, straight. then later on in the film, mainly in her visions, she
has long, curly very light blonde hair. then she has dark blonde hair...
then she has dark brown hair again. what's with that?<br /><br />i don't really know the true story of Joan of arc, but this movie
portrayed
her as completely self-absorbed, schizophrenic, and generally crazy, not
the
kind of person who deserves canonisation.
Also the character's personalities seem to change really dramatically. for
instance when Joan comes to the king's palace she seems timid, and unsure
of
herself. the king seems good-natured and also timid. then  Joan get's an
army, and she's very suddenly extremely tough and domineering, knows
exactly
what she's doing. what the?? towards the end of the movie the king
completely changes his character too. before he trusts joan, and then
suddenly he hates her, and he becomes a conceited, mean person. for
example,
he didn't think his crown was nice enough. i mean.. i'm sure time may have
changed who he is and his personality, but they don't have any indication
in
the movie as to why he'd become that way.<br /><br />i did think milla jovovich was good as Joan though, and if you have 3
hours
to kill and nothing more exciting to do then sit on the lounge watching a
boring movie, then go ahead. watch it.
