Honestly, what a let-down this was. The supporting characters were so much
more vivid and interesting (Faye Dunaway, Timothy West) than the main
protagonists. It was quite bold to use the modern vocabulary and perhaps
some viewers needed the odd French accent to tell who was who but this was
at odds with the medieval settings and costumes.<br /><br />I gave up and went to bed early.....
