2005_November 10 
I like a good medieval epic, and I like films in which medieval combat
is depicted in a believable fashion. I even like films that are bad
enough to be accidentally entertaining. Whether the battle scenes are
believable is something I leave to others, but The Messenger is neither
of the other two. It is a mishmash of scenes with little, if any,
focus. It takes itself far too seriously for the viewer to extract any
fun out of it. Above all else, it features a cast vying so hard for an
Oscar that it becomes painful. Milla&#39;s performances in the Resident
Evil films were more appealing than as the seventeen year old rebel
leader who forever changed the history of France. Not that I find
France a particularly interesting subject in the first place, but
France deserves a lot better than this. I must concur with most of the
critics in this instance that Hollywood&#39;s desire to grind the histories
of every country, even America&#39;s, into five-minute-noodle-like chunks
has grown out of control. You do not expect complete truth in any
historical epic, but come on.<br /><br />To those who claim that this is yet another attempt by Hollywood to
demonise Christians, I have one word to say: suckers. Films that
demonise Christians exist solely so you can whine about it. Speaking as
an Aspie (a member of a minority group that was slandered to hell and
back recently in Law &amp; Order: Trial By Jury), your crocodile tears are
wasted on me. While Joan&#39;s fanaticism is all over the place in this
film, the most scarily accurate portrayals are those of the Church
figures drafted by both governments to put Joan out of their misery.
Anyone who wants a kindergarten version of why the trial by jury system
was invented would do well to observe these scenes. Contrary to what
some critics might tell you, these instances of verdicts being decided
before the trial begins are quite common in societies where Church and
State have intermingled. So kudos to Luc Besson for getting that part
right.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the rest of the film is an unholy mess. Milla Jojovich
is badly miscast as J&#39;eanne, the girl who would lead an army to take
back a small plot of land. She is about as French as I am, and there is
no effort on the part of makeup artists, dialogue coaches, or even
screenwriters, to hide the fact. Although faint tinges of her original
Ukranian mode of speech remain, she sounds so American that half the
time when she is addressing Richard Ridings&#39; La Hire (one of the few
well-cast roles in the film), you half expect her to ask him if he
wants fries with that. In spite of having a mere fraction of the screen
time, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo and John Malkovich act rings around Jojovich. Put
them in a girly suit and give them a sword, I am sure they would make a
far better J&#39;eanne. Their dramatic range is far wider, for one thing.
Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head when he said that this film
&quot;labors under the misapprehension that Joan&#39;s life is a war story and
takes place largely on battlefields&quot;.<br /><br />When The Messenger is on the battlefield, it manages to remain
interesting for about half of a scene length. The tactics used in one
major siege sequence are even amusing. The problem is that when Besson
tries to do anything besides an action sequence, it does not work.
After the umpteenth shot of Milla acting all bug-eyed for the camera
while an array of stupid visual effects surround her, you are just
waiting for Joan to be defeated so this mess can finish already. Not
content to be incomprehensible while Joan is fighting or developing her
reasons to fight, however, Besson insisted in including scenes with
Dustin Hoffman where he constantly tells her what an idiot she is, or
something along those lines. It always amuses me when people whine
about Joan being portrayed as if she is insane. She was a seventeen
year old girl who felt so strongly that she had to go to war that it
impressed veterans in the French army. That, and statistics, pretty
much convince me that she was. Religion had nothing to do with her
marching into the hundred years war. No film, no matter how much it
crows at me that the Church is awesome (the same Church that burned her
at the behest of the government?), is going to convince me otherwise.<br /><br />I gave The Messenger a two out of ten. It is too bad to be good, and
not bad enough to be good, either. It is stuck so firmly in No Man&#39;s
Land it might as well have not been made.
