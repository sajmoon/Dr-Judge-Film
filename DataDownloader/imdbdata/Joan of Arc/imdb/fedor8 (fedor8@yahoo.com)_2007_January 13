Milla Jovovich&#39;s casting is quite a good and rather extreme example of
what happens when a director&#39;s judgment gets clouded by his sexual
attraction to a non-actress &quot;supermodel&quot;. Once Besson&#39;s penis started
making creative decisions it was over with this movie and maybe his
career as a whole. Once a penis gets its slippery head in the door it&#39;s
&quot;bye-bye quality&quot;. For a penis cares not about Jovovich&#39;s talents; the
only talents a director&#39;s penis cares for are the other &quot;talents&quot;. And
Jovovich&#39;s magic triangle must have put quite a spell on Besson&#39;s
single-minded one-eyed warrior, to the extent that he actually cast her
in his second consecutive movie! Jovovich&#39;s &quot;performance&quot; is as
one-dimensional as it gets; her Joan is always manic, silly,
unconvincing, fanatical, humourless, and insane. A scene in which Milla
tries to inspire her troops just before a battle, has the opposite
effect on the viewer than was intended: instead of impressing the
viewers as well (like Gibson in &quot;Braveheart&quot;), she causes them to
wonder why a single soldier would want to follow this six-foot
floozy-supermodel-turned-bad-actress into battle. There is only one
other woman &#150; from the fashion world - who would have been much worse
than Jovovich: Claudia Schiffer. But it&#39;s just a matter of time before
Schiffer, too, traps a major director&#39;s penis into submission and
unconditional surrender. Plus, Jovovich is not particularly attractive
&#150; and I&#39;m being very diplomatic and nice about it now. She has
something masculine about her, and the hair-cut she has in the film
only emphasizes my point.<br /><br />The movie is visually rather nice, and the battle scenes are quite good
&#150; after all, a lot of money was invested in this - but there is a lack
of seriousness which undermines the movie. Besson clearly didn&#39;t have a
clue whether he was making a gung-ho not-too-serious adventure movie or
a dark, somber historical drama. The film meanders between heavy drama,
and ridiculous French slip-on-a-banana-peel silliness.<br /><br />Overall, not as bad as many people who hate the movie claim, but with
quite a few major flaws.
