If you really want to know the story of Jeanne d'Arc, you should better
take a book... then you will learn that we do not know a lot of things
about
her. But the Luc Besson's movie never aimed to tell the &lt;&lt; true
&gt;&gt; story, but A story, it is very different. If you can't understand
it, so you don't even understand what is cinema.<br /><br />As a movie, I find it great. The story is moving in a different way. And
the violence is necessary. The story to be told IS violent, but I do not
think the entire movie is violent because the end of film annihilates this
violence. The last confession is there to tell us that everybody can be
blind when one has a cause to defend, this is a message of tolerance to the
people who act badly, One has to understand them and know that they suffer
too.
