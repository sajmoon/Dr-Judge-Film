1999_November 12 

If Milla Jovovich does not receive an Academy Award as well as the film
garnering the Palm D'or at Cannes, then I will be absolutely shocked.
This
is a movie with such terrible impact that half the audience was in tears.
I
can not speak to the authenticity of the history but anyone will see that
the theme and message were crystal clear.  A must see. Without
reservation,
I can give this film a rating of 10 and I thought that I'd never do
anything
so extreme, but this film deserves a 10.
