My misses is of the opinion that this movie effected me so much because Mila
was in the lead. This said it is a fantastic movie and bravely done with a
French director portraying one of his country's heros as a bit of a
fruit-loop. I really wanted this to be a ten out of ten movie, but it falls
short, mostly due to the disjointed battle scenes. You never really get a
feel of the heat of the battle. The performances by Jovovich especialy are
good with Hoffman standing out in a show stealing cameo.<br /><br />Watch this and Joan will be in your head for days afterwards.
