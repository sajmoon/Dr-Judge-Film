This movie, IMO, is just great. It has a lot to say and it has no &quot;not
needed&quot; scenes. Milla Jovovich acts very good in the movie. It is a real
ART
movie, it's not another HOLYWOOD (AKA Special Effects ONLY) movie. I
enjoyed
watching it, as it's both an art movie and a history movie.<br /><br />10/10
