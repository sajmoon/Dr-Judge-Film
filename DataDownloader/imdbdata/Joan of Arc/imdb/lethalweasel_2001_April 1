2001_April 1 

In my entire life, I have only walked out of one movie in the theatres; with
all the others I figured that, since I'd paid for it, I might as well, at
least see all of it.  This movie was so bad it drove me out of the theatre. 
Not only did I leave early, I spent the next hour sitting around in the
lobby of the theatre because I was driving some friends who didn't get the
sense to walk out until there was only a half hour left in this monstrosity.
 You know what?  Waiting doing nothing in the lobby was far better than this
hideous film.<br /><br />Where do I start with what was wrong?  How about the acting.  Milla was so
far beyond awful it cannot be described properly.  She spends the entire
film shrieking.  Not yelling, not shouting, literally shrieking, in a
piercing, whiny nasal tone of voice that gave me a splitting headache
(literally, not figuratively) after five minutes.  Whether you believe that
Jeanne D'Arc was touched by God or not, she undeniably had the charisma to
inspire her men.  I cannot believe that the men wouldn't string this version
of her up!  And don't get started on how she apparently has an orgasm every
time she rides her horse.<br /><br />The historical accuracy was non existent.  The Dauphin was a teenager, no
older than Joan, and he is played by a forty-six year-old man!  The guys was
three times too old!  Then we have a scene were Joan rides her horse up to
an English &quot;fort&quot;, jumps the wall, rides around shrieking like a spastic
harpy while the English sit around with their thumbs in their noses, and
cuts the rope, lowering the gate, allowing her forces to attack.  Nothing
remotely like this ever happened!<br /><br />We are also treated to demented concepts of medieval warfare, with giant
erector-set type tubes shooting huge granite marbles out of forts into
attacking men.  Real medieval warfare was terrible enough, why add this
nonsense to it, making it a humourless joke.<br /><br />And here's a question: if the point of the movie was to be that Joan was
just a revenge-obsessed lunatic, why did they show her getting a literally
un-survivable arrow wound, instead of the much less lethal one she actually
recieved?<br /><br />This movie is an insult to the French people and to Christians, both of
which I can live with, as I am neither.  But it is also horribly made,
inaccurate, an insult to anyone with a functioning brain, boring, and, above
all literally painful to try and sit through!
