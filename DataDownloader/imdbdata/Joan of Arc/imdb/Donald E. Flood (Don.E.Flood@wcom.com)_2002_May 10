I am sorry to say that I would not recommend this film to anyone!  Few
Americans would tolerate a film about the life of a great President (say,
George Washington) who was portrayed as a closet transvestite who kept a
heard of goats in the basement of the White House for his sexual pleasure.
And yet, this is how Saint Joan of Arc was portrayed in &quot;The Messenger&quot;
film
-- someone who was a delusional, schizophrenic, egotistical, emotional, and
narcissistic woman obsessed with revenge for the &quot;hypothetical murder&quot; of
her older sister, an event which all historians agree did NOT take place.
Anyone desiring to learn about the real Jehanne should read Regine Pernoud,
especially her book &quot;Joan of ARC: By Herself and Her Witnesses&quot;, a
masterpiece on the life of Jehanne, la Pucelle.
