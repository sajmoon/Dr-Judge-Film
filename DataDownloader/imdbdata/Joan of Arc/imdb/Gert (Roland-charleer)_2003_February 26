At first, I think this movie is too long. It should have been 30 minutes
shorter. Second, the acting is actually bad. Even Dustin Hoffman and John
Malkovich are pretty bad. I really love the action scenes. They are very
well crafted. That's actually the only thing that was good about this movie.
Luc Besson disappoints me. * out of ****
