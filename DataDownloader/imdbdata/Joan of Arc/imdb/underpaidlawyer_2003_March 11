This is a good film. I wouldn't venture to say that it's the best, because
it's not. It's definatly worth seeing for history buffs (though I would
heavilly question it's historical accuraccy.) It does however have a
heafty
dose of one of the things I dislike about Besson's work, there sometimes
isn't enough contrast between tension and a lack thereof. This is
especially
the case in The Messenger. I would recommend this, but be advised:
Besson's
other works (The Professional, Nikita) are much, much better.
