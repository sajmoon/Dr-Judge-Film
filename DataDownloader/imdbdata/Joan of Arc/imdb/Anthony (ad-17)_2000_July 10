Critics have been harsh on this movie but for the life of me I can't see
why. <br /><br />The film was a wonderful exploration of the Maid of New Orleans and the life
she lead. It explored the question of whether she truly saw the visions or
whether she was delusional. More importantly it didn't answer the question,
instead putting forwards the facts and raising the doubts in a delightfully
delicious way. Dustin Hoffman's performance was superb.<br /><br />The omnipotent ones (the film critics) were harsh on Milla Jovavich's
performance yet I thought she played an uneducated but passionate farm girl
perfectly. She was supposed to be ignorant of most matters - but strong in
faith. A faith that Besson questioned subtly but well.<br /><br />Ignore the critics. See and save this one.
