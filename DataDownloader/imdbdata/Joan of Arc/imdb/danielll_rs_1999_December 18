&quot;The Messenger&quot; (or &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;) is the kind of film that is difficult to
form a solid opinion about. At least I felt that after watching it. It's a
very strange, quite unusual biographical epic, with many good things and
some bad things.<br /><br />After a small explanation of the situation of France that time (the war with
England for the French territory), the film starts showing a pre-adolescent
Jeanne (or Joan, as you wish) confessing in a church of her village. She
claims that she has some visions in which a boy tells her what to do. Some
minutes after, in a field, she has one of those visions and, when she 'wakes
up' the English soldiers are destroying her village. She sees her sister
being killed, then raped by a soldier, and after the funeral she goes to
live with her uncles in another village. Jeanne seems very shocked with
everything, but continues having visions. Some years pass, and Charles VII,
who is to become king, is told that a young woman who claims to have visions
in which she sees God, is coming to see him in order to be a soldier of the
French army. He seems a little confused with this, but the only way for him
to become the king of France is to win the war against England, and for that
he has to accept Jeanne as a soldier. She cumplishes her mission and faces
the English soldiers. In the middle of all that, she continues having
visions and things starts to get confusing and dangerous for
her.<br /><br />The story is not so hard to follow as in other epic films (as &quot;Elizabeth&quot;),
but the film is quite. The first one hour is very interesting, but then come
the battle scenes and these are just tedious. They show many headless
bodies, blood, but can't escape from being boring. It's the worst part of
the film and I felt tempted to leave the movies. However, the last 40
minutes are very beautiful. The ending is wonderful and lets us with many
questions about who was Joan of Arc in fact and what her visions
meant.<br /><br />The acting in &quot;The Messenger&quot; is great, specially from the supporting
actors. John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman all give solid
performances. And there's Milla Jovovich. Well, her acting is another thing
on the film that is quite difficult to form an opinion about. She shows
talent in the scenes of visions, but she can be annoying when she yells.
Overall she did a pretty decent job.<br /><br />&quot;The Messenger&quot; has everything an epic should have: beautiful costumes,
wonderful art-direction, good music, beautiful photography, etc. Luc
Besson's directing is also efficient. But I still think it's difficult to
say what I really thought of the film. For now, I give it a nice 7/10,
because I wasn't really disappointed, but of course it could have been much
better.
