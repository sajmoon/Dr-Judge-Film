The film itself, as a FILM is not all bad. But the portrayal of Joan and
the
accuracy of the story is a disgrace. Joan is portrayed as a screaming,
raving and at times downright annoying lunatic whose visions are all
delusions. The Film is not accurate enough in the dialogue or the scenery
to
be taken seriously either. The makers of this should be ashamed of
themselves.
Mila did a good acting job, but she was nothing like Joan, more something
like a mental patient. Someone needed to tell the makers of the film that
Joan didnt have blonde hair either.<br /><br />Hopefully, one day, an ACCURATE film about Joan will be
made.<br /><br />*out of *****
