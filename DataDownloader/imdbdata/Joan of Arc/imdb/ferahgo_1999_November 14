wow. this may have been the _most_ random movie i have ever seen.  i have
never watched a movie that made less sense.  you are thrown headlong into a
life that happens so insanely quickly that i cannot follow it, and i am not
stupid.  at first it seems that it is a statement on how religion is the
only way, and that everyone should follow blindly.
go watch dogma. (by the way, WHY DOESN'T SHE EVER STOP TWICHING?????
AHHHH!
