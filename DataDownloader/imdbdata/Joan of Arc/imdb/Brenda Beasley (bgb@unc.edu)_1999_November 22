1999_November 22 

Seldom do I leave a theatre angry.  But &quot;The Messenger&quot; left me seething
with venom.  Instead of a valiant life and death, Jean d'Arc is a victim of
the screenwriters and director. It is incredulous to me that 500 years
later, Jean d'Arc is still being crucified by the other gender.  I guess I
was hoping for another &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; a period piece with a heroine, based on
as much fact as possible.<br /><br />Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but personally I felt Besson and
Birken's interpretation was too liberal.  While much is not known about
Jean
d'Arc, it is preposterous and even blasphemous to think her actions were
for
her own glory.  She is shown running around with her eyes wide and wild, no
senses about her, way over-dramatized.  And she REPEATEDLY says &quot;I am only
a
messenger.&quot;  That is obvious from the title.  Once would have been gracious
plenty.  The part where she whispers in the Dauphin's ear was quite
effective.  But why drag out that persona throughout the entire film?  The
battle scenes were clipped so short you couldn't tell who was fighting who
(maybe that was the point).  I didn't appreciate Jean being made to look
weak and stupid.  There aren't many heroines as role models in this period
in history, if any, and to make a mockery of one of the most valiant
crusaders is a travesty.<br /><br />Perhaps the film should have started out with her canonization.  There was
little said about that, even though it was 500 years later.  And the
coronation scene was heavily borrowed from Kenneth Branaugh's &quot;Hamlet,&quot;
glorious as it was.<br /><br />I hope someone else will make another film that credits Jean d'Arc for the
great crusader she was.
