I decided to give this movie a two, simply because I can still
appreciate good visuals (even when directors and producers believe this
substitutes for poor script writing), however, this was a totally bland
interpretation of both a controversial and complex historic figure. <br /><br />I know from his latest movies that Luc Besson enjoys
simplistic/childish humor, clich&#xE9; moments, thin dialog, and two
dimensional characters... all coated in pleasant costumes, with decent
music and good photography/camera work. However this incredibly flat
and superficial interpretation of Joan of Arc&#x27;s life is completely
emancipatory and forgetful at the very best. <br /><br />His biggest downfall was to choose the story of such a prominent figure
in history which required so much more work than just a super-imposed
stylistic approach from a director who, in his success, could afford to
throw in key ingredients to Cookie cut himself another successful
blockbuster... There was so much material that could have been explored
from what we know of the life and death of Joan la Pucelle, as well as
the period in which this story takes place, and the characters that may
have influenced her as well as the many she did influence along the
way... the list goes on! I hope another director will be up for the
challenge in the future, because this story has real potential for an
all out classic movie.<br /><br />Ways in which this can be achieved: 1- get a better lead actress, no
offense to Mila but this role is WAY out of her league! she should
stick to what she knows... 2- get a better script writer - one who can
focus on what he really wants to write (because this one goes in all
directions) and write it with more maturity!! 3- get a director who can
explore the story with more depth and understanding, because I don&#x27;t
think Mr Besson really understood the essence of the Character...
putting it plainly, even if Joan was a lunatic, she saved France and
led an army to victory... would an army follow a screaming
adolescent/psychotic child? She was also incredibly intelligent, that
we know from the materials that survived her trial, where she defended
herself. She was also terrified of being burnt. <br /><br />very unfortunate this movie was such a fail, I hope the story gets
another shot...
