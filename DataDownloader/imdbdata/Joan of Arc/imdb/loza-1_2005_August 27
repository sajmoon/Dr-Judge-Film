Not long before I saw this film, I had read Vita Sackville-West's
excellent biography of St Joan. The work she put into the research to
find the actual facts regarding the patron saint of those who fight for
their country won my admiration.<br /><br />I was therefore bitterly disappointed with this film which monkeyed
around with the known facts to sex things up a bit. That's just
cynical. <br /><br />Firstly, why have a glamourpuss of a Joan of Arc? Sadly, the only known
contemporary portrait of St Joan is lost. However, all contemporary
accounts describe her as short of stature and plain(ish).<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there is no evidence that any member of her
family was killed or raped by marauders. Therefore the film's
motivation of St Joan on a crusade of revenge is utter drivel.<br /><br />I am afraid that the howling mad Scotsman with the red beard who was
fighting on the side of the English was something of a renegade: any
Scots at the Siege of Orleans (and there were some there) fought for
the French. (The painter of the one lost painting of St Joan mentioned
above was a Scot.)<br /><br />Yes, it is certainly true that the French had longbows as well as
arblasts and handguns; but why do I get the impression that the film
makers couldn't care if the French had longbows or not, and they got
this historical point right by accident?<br /><br />I really think that however good the production and the acting may be,
this film is an insult to the likes of Vita Sackville-West and to those
historians who put extreme efforts to find out what REALLY happened.
Meanwhile, Joe Public and his family are served this dish of rotting
entrails as &quot;an historical film&quot;.
