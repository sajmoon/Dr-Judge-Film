Wow, what a failure of what could have been a fantastic movie.  The Legend
of Billie Jean was better!!  At least they had their accents right in that
film!  It was hard to tell who was English and who was French, when
everyone
sounded like they were from the Midwest US. No English accents, no French
accents, but I think one of the English guys had a Scottish accent,
possibly? How about the scene where they are all smeared w/ blood after
she
releases a prisoner.  In the next scene she's absolutely covered in blood!
I had to repeat it twice just make sure I really was seeing it.  Notice
she's blonde in the beginning?  After she's captured she's brunett.  The
voices in my head told me the acting was great, as was the vision.  But I
felt like I was losing it w/ all the flaws in the movie.
