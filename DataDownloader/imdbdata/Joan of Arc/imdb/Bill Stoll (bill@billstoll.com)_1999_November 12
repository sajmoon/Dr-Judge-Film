Do you know the difference between a psychotic zealot and someone truly
touched God?  This movie lays it out neatly for you.  It covers your ticket
cost and time investment in the bargain.  I liked it, all scenes considered.
 It earned 2.5 out of four  possible Bill Stoll stars.<br /><br />The film controls your senses from the start.  Young Joan's first words are
`It's wonderful!'  A cinematic interpretation of `wonderful' follows from
the eyes and heart of a young girl that'll steal your heart.  Then, when
you're swept up in the height of it all, Director Luc Besson slams you into
the brutal brick wall know as 15th century France.  Joan's sister's fate
drops us into the depths of our fears, where Joan's tale actually begins. <br /><br />I enjoyed every frame until the coronation of Charles VII.  Everything was
clicking.  Even the coronation itself was brilliantly conveyed to film, if
not the best scene after the opening.  I was drawn in (emotionally and
objectively).  But then, as though 2.5 hours offered insufficient time, it
segued abruptly into the inevitable `French Inquisition' and deteriorated to
execute the problem named Joan.   Her demise and battles with conscience
slowed to the point where my attention wavered.  I checked my watch more
than once, never a good sign.  It wasn't the acting; it was the writing here
in Act III.  It needed something more.  You knew her fate was sealed; but it
deserved a more storytelling finesse for quality consistency against the
story's brilliant opening and middle.  <br /><br />The acting is superb.  Milla Jovovich (Joan) is perfect in the role. 
Costumes, photography, cinematography: top shelf, stunning and &#150; along with
the acting &#150; major candidates for Oscar nominations.  I loved Faye Dunaway
in the Yolande role.  Dustin Hoffman as conscience (aka God) is great. 
Everyone seems to be a natural.  She tells the secret of Joan's success
completely and early on in the movie.  Listen to her words.  B-/C+ on the
writing.  <br /><br />You DO want to know the difference between that first paragraph's zealot and
a true Messenger . . . don't you?   See this movie.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />
