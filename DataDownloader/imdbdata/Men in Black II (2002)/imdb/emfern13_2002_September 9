There is no doubt that MIIB is the worst movie of the summer. Its not
awful
but it really sucks compared to the last one. Will Smith and Tommy Lee
Jones
dont have very good chemistry and neither one of them were funny. Lara
Flynn
Boyle was very sexy but her character was just stupid, she was a crappy
bad
guy. Some of the aliens in this movie were pretty cool. Frank the Pug is
back and he is hilarious, the funniest character in the whole movie.
Overall, has some funny moments but other than that it just isnt a good
sequel.
