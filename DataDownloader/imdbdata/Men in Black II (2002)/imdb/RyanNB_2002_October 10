I thought it was an entertaining movie, but I was still quite disappointed
with it.  It seems like they just took the things that everyone liked from
the first film and focused on them, without bothering to come up with a
story of some kind.  Even the special effects looked bad in this one for
some reason.  I saw it on pay per view in a hotel so it might have been
the
television, but it looked like they didn't put as much time and effort
into
the effects for this film as they did for the original.<br /><br />It was a silly and unoriginal movie.  You'll get some laughs out of it,
but
you'll forget you ever saw it ten minutes after the credits roll.
Considering the length of time they had between this film and the
original,
they should have been able to come up with something better.
