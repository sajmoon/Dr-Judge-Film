People like to trash this movie, but I found it to be enjoyable,
despite feeling more tired than the original.<br /><br />Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great in this. And a lot of the
jokes seem to be in line with the original.<br /><br />The best scenes are a kung-fu fighting Rip Torn (from nowhere), the
return of the dog from part 1 and anything involving Laura Flynn Boyle.
She's a hoot to watch.<br /><br />I didn't really like the time subplot, as things tended to feel a
little forced.<br /><br />Still, it's worth your time.<br /><br />The opening is great as well, with lots of big laughs and a great cameo
by Peter Graves (one of my favorites).<br /><br />I'm hoping for a Men in Black 3!
