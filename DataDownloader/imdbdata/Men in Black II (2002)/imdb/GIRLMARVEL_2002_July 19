Since the first MIB, you'd think they would have had a greater comeback. I
believe that people should be told the truth when it comes to movies. I
didn't read any reviews on this movie and I should have. Like I said, I was
very disappointed in this film and in Will Smith. I think Will Smith is a
funny man, but this movie just made him look bad. ALL of the trailers
spoiled the whole movie. Instead of going to see it at the movies, you can
just sit at home and watch it on your t.v.<br /><br />I liked the first MIB. It was very original. But I'm sure Will Smith will
make it up in the future. But overall Jones and Smith tried to keep the
movie on track.
