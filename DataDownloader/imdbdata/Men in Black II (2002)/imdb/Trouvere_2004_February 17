Not a &quot;bad&quot; movie in my opinion - however it's not as edgy as the
original.
A point criticized by many is that the movie is &quot;just another
shape-shifting
alien threatening the entire earth scenario&quot; - but that's what MIB stories
are SUPPOSED to be about.<br /><br />Would it be a James Bond movie if 007 wasn't out trying to &quot;save the world
from another evil power-hungry megalomaniac&quot;?<br /><br />Poor Agent J - at least 007 gets the girl.<br /><br />It's an entertaining movie, worth watching, but they weren't bucking for
an
Oscar here.  Personally, I wouldn't mind if they DID make the &quot;MIB&quot; movies
into a long-running series like they did with the James Bond flicks.
Sure,
you know that the good guys are just going to save the world from some
nasty
evil alien - but I'd be willing to pay six bucks to see how they do
it.<br /><br />
