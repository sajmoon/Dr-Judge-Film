I rented this because I was in desperate need of something mindless,
silly,
and (hopefully) funny.  I knew it would be mindless, and I hoped it would
be
silly.  What a pleasant surprise that it was also funny.<br /><br />As a sequel, MIB 2 was inspired.  After all, no one was going to laugh at
the set up again.  More of the same would be--ell, more of the same.  So
what makes it a good sequel is the humor--particularly the great sense of
the timing on the jokes.  This is true comic writing and comic cinematic
direction.<br /><br />The autopilot, for example, is a perfect, wordless joke--brilliantly
conceived and executed.  And the train station locker is another,
off-the-wall concept--unexpected and unusual.<br /><br />Another directorial success is in not having Jones exactly reprise his
character.  His interpretation of the disgruntled, skeptical, and
authoritarian postmaster is both dead-pan and inspired--timing, again. K
is
both crabbier and more in control than he was before his nebulizaiton,
even
though he has to cope with being 5 years behind on the MIB technology.<br /><br />He is still sad and wistful about his role in the universe; and moreover,
things have happened to him in his 5 years off the force, things that they
tell on his personality.  Kudos to Jones and Sonnenfeld for sketching in
these changes.<br /><br />There are also some nice one liners.  I won't repeat them, because then
you
won't find them funny.  But check out J's response to the dog's advice on
romance.  Pure wit, crude and simple.<br /><br />To top it off, this movie is short enough not to wear out its welcome, and
is not extended with  interminable shoot-em-ups and car
chases.
