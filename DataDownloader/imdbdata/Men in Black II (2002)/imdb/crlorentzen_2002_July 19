There are only two things I liked about this movie
1.  Frank as J's partner
2.  The end where our world is in a locker. (reminisent of the first
movie)<br /><br />This was the worst $8 I've ever spent.
The plot was weak and full of pop fluff.
I was really looking forward to this movie...I was expecting to see
something as fun as the original.
