I cannot believe that I paid money to see this drivel.  The actors
seemed
to be sleep walking through their parts, and nothing about it was funny.
Nothing.  The ONLY laugh our theater got was when the chair my husband was
sitting in broke and he fell on the floor.  All the &quot;cute&quot; characters were
utterly annoying (Frank the dog first and foremost) and the plot was muddy
and confusing.  I have never been so disappointed after leaving a theater.
The really annoying thing is that the first one was very entertaining. I
know that sequels normally lack a little of the first, but come on!  It
was
like this movie was written by a second grade class.  Not good. Not good
at
all.  Please do not see this movie in the theater.  Think about passing it
up on the rental shelf as well.  Rent the original instead and save
yourself
from wasting precious time on the sequel.
