First: I loved the first one. And the commercials on TV looked rather
promising so I decided to watch MIB2 right on &quot;launch-day&quot;. Midly said - I
was really disappointed!
The jokes were lame, they wanted to make the movie funny but that just
didn't work out, no match for the first part. Second bad thing - the worst
FX I've seen in a movie for a long time. It looked even worse then part 1
and that is five years old - some generations when it comes to computer
graphics!
But what disappointed me the most in the end was the final fight. It was
sooo short and boring and again with very poor FX that I went out of the
cinema with the worst feeling I ever had for a movie that I went to the
theaters for.
