While this presentation is only 10 minutes shorter than its
predecessor, it seemed about half as long in terms of content versus
the original -- but twice as long in-terms of being a far, far
less-interesting story, and a disappointing sequel to an excellent
original.<br /><br />I agree completely with those who have said that the director (and
writer) seemed to have placed the majority of effort solely on the
special effects aspect, with the storyline far below the quality of the
original.<br /><br />It&#39;s a shame, considering that talents of Smith, Jones and Torn, and
the material was so weak at times, it seemed to affect the intensity of
their performances as well.<br /><br />I rated the original at 9*.. Marking this sequel at 5* is generous,
since it probably should be no better than half the rating of the
original, probably a bit lower.
