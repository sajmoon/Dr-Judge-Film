The first movie was a summer smash and a real Blockbuster with a truly
original idea, and concept. The first had so much to offer, the two
totally
opposite end of the spectrum actors like Smith, and Jones. In the second
one
the magic doesn't seem to be there anymore. At this point I think a remake
of the first one with more of the same jokes and ideas would have been
better than this monstrosity. The story is easy to follow, to easy almost.
All these people are falling in love but you don't care because you are
never really introduced to them. There is a lot of inside humor from the
first one that would make this especially unenjoyable to anybody that
watches it not having seen the first. Overall, a 5/10, because it had its
moments, but ultimately lacked in what should have been a STELLAR sequel.
That's the worst part all the hype and excitement for such a
disappointment.
