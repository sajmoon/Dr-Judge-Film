Couldn't watch for more than 5 minutes. Boring.<br /><br />The first Men In Black was incredibly engaging from the instant the music
began through the end. This one sucked with that stupid opening sequence
with Peter Graves with &quot;supposed-to-be-bad-special-effects&quot; that were NOT
funny, just lame.<br /><br />Early on in the movie Patrick Warburton grabs something that looks like a
dandelion from a city sewer grate, which turns out to be a piece of a huge
alien that becomes angry at Warburton's grab. The monster jumps out of the
sewer and chomps on Warburton.<br /><br />In the first film the MIB were always careful not to let the public see
aliens. If an alien was spotted, they had to bring in their &quot;containment&quot;
crew to undo the PR damage. Here, they simply don't care who sees
it.<br /><br />Typically sloppy for a Hollywood sequel to simply disregard all the elements
that made it a good story in the first place.<br /><br />One good thing about this movie. Now I know to avoid Barry Sonnenfeld films.
For a while after I saw Men In Black I actually thought he was a good
director. Although I never got suckered into Wild Wild West (never appealed
to me at all). Another good thing. I was able to get a refund for this film
after the first 5 minutes and got to see another film.<br /><br />
