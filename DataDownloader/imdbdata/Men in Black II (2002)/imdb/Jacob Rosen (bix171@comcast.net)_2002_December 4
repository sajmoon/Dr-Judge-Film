The special effects are surprisingly below expectations--there are some
badly done matte shots and the animation supplements are fairly obvious--but
fortunately the tongue-in-cheek camaraderie between leads Will Smith and
Tommy Lee Jones, perhaps the most important component to the film's success,
more than makes up for them and it's a sequel that because of its loose,
funky nature outshines its predecessor (itself a good time). Breathlessly
directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and written with pleasing goofiness by Robert
Gordon and Barry Fanaro, it goes about its business professionally and
smoothly, essentially reprising the first film plot (aliens looking for a
missing bauble while Earth is in jeopardy) but wisely expanding the roles of
that film's best supporting characters (Frank the Pug--who earns the
majority of laughs--and the lazy salamanders). The actors are clearly having
fun--they know they've hit paydirt--and once again Smith proves to be a good
sport by being the fall guy. A fast and fun time.
