2002_September 5 

after the joke that was 'wild wild west' and the painfully annoying flop
'Ali' Smith needed something to get back some respect but all this movie
seems to be is a load of yes men milking his huge ego. I found it boring and
now where near as enjoyable as MIB. Also Mr Smith PLEASE spare us anymore of
your soundtracks that you feel we all need, 'nod your head' more like 'bow
your head (in shame)'
