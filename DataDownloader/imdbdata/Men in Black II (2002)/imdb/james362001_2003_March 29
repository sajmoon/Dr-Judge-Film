A long-awaited sequel.  Never had I heard so much bad word-of-mouth about a
film even before it was released.  I was very disappointed in Men In Black
II.  I somewhat enjoyed the first film. Will Smith seems to play the same
smart-aleck character in every film he does.  In this one, he is cutting
people off in mid-sentence wanting them to shut-up.  Being rude and
insulting to white people in this film really turned me off.  Bad writing. 
I didn't feel there was enough screen time for Tommy Lee Jones.  Is there a
plot in this film?  Interesting was the cameo appearance of
singer/actor/entertainer Michael Jackson.  Perhaps Michael Jackson would
have been better than Will Smith  (Michael Jackson was good in THE WIZ
[1978]). The outtakes were of just more of Will Smith wasting more valuable
time just to be silly and get attention.  The Blooper reel shows how
unprofessional Will Smith can be whereas Tommy Lee Jones can prove how much
of a consummate actor he is.  Tommy Lee Jones can be serious and jump right
back into character when the director needs it.  The sequel just might have
killed the entire Men In Black franchise once and for all.  Will Smith and
Special Effects does not always work for a film.  Men In Black means &quot;black
suit&quot; not &quot;ethnic&quot;.  I would like to see Tommy Lee Jones do a Men In Black
without Will Smith.  I liked the alternate ending where Will Smith was put
in the egg pod.  Perhaps that is where they should have cut and ended the
film right there.  Watch Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS (1978).
