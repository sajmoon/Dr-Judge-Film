2002_July 28 

My friends in the Cam and I went to see this with my son (who has fallen in
love with this movie).  Besides laughing at pie (inside Cam joke) comments,
we laughed almost the whole time the movie was on the screen.  It moved
quickly, giving you little time to breath, as the plot progressed. <br /><br />MIIB isn't Shakepeare, Castaway, or Forrest Gump.  It's meant for taking
your gal/guy to in the middle of summer, and relaxing for approx. 2 hours or
so.  I am a Star Wars fan, Trekker, and I liked Batman.  MIIB isn't the
world's best movie ever. It's not the worst either (there are several that I
WOULD classify as that, did someone mention a movie based on Power Rangers
or Barney!??).  It entertained me.  I won't go into details on the plot.
Enough other folks have spoiled it enough.  I will say though that this
movie is considered to be a few years after the first.  That DOES make a
difference in Jay.  In 5 years, any employee improves their skills (and
becomes top agent!).  Patrick's role as T had me laughing, but then I also
liked his role in _The_Emperor's_New_Grove_ .  Frank stole the show for me,
though!  My son sang along with him with &quot;...Dogs...&quot;. <br /><br />It was worth the price tag to entertain us without us having to drive to the
amusement park (the food concessions were another story!), and I plan to
watch it when it reaches the $1 theater in the next two months.  I also plan
to re-see Spiderman and Epie II there as well.  <br /><br />If you are uncertain if it's worth watching, check your own local for the
reduced rate theaters and catch it there.  It's an acquired taste, but I
loved it!<br /><br />(and we're buying ALL the BK toys now, lol!)<br /><br />I give it 6 1/2 out of 10 stars.
