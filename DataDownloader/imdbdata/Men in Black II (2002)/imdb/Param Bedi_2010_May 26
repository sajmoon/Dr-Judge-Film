the movie does some justice to its prequel but lacks a bit in story.<br /><br />visuals are appealing as well as humorous especially the DOG. Never
ever seen such a talky dog. <br /><br />I personally liked the Dog scenes more than anything else.<br /><br />Acting-wise both MIB did their job well.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson looked very nice in the movie<br /><br />MJ&#x27;s cameo is hilarious<br /><br />Movie is only good enough for max 2-3 times, but DOG scenes can be
watched any no. of times.<br /><br />MIB 3 is hitting the theatres in mid 2012<br /><br />Lets Hope MIB 3 has something better to offer in terms of story
