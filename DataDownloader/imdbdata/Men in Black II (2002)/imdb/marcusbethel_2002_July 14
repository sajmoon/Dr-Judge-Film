Allow me to preface this commentary by stating 'I am a huge fan of Will
Smith and do believe him to be an incredibly talented actor'. Nonetheless,
upon leaving the theatre, I couldn't help but feeling cheated out of
another
$8 for a Will Smith movie!<br /><br />Men in Black II, while having a great ensemble cast, being visually
stunning
and displaying some mastery of 3-D special effects wizardry, is a movie
that
suffers from a severe case of 'bad Hollywood sequel writing'. Without
going
as far as to reveal the plot, this movie does little more than set itself
up
for another sequel. I left the theatre asking more questions than when I
entered but felt dissatisfied with the fact that I just paid $8 to see a
2-hour trailer for Men In Black III. Everything about the movie, and
especially the ending, hints at the fact that Hollywood is already
preparing
for another Men in Black.<br /><br />In a summer chockfull of sequels, Men in Black II is probably the worst of
the crop showing Hollywood Script Writing at it's worst. In short, aside
from having all the original cast members and great 'eye-candy', the movie
lacked the true substance necessary to make it worthy of the title 'A
great
sequel to a great movie!'
