 I'd be repeating what just about everybody else has said that this movie
not as good as the first one. But there are good things about it. The
special effects are well done. Rick Baker's aliens are full of creativity.(
not that Rick Baker could ever produce schlock from his imagination) I loved
the pug and the worm guys. They were enjoyable comic relief. But the movie
lacks the charm and humor of the first.  Lara Flynn Boyle and Johny
Knowville are just not compelling as bad guys. I thought the whole plot
about &quot;the light&quot; was rather muddled.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones did a
good job with what the script gave them. In a way this movie proves if you
have a great movie that doesn't need a sequel, just leave it that
way.<br /><br />PS I wish Tommy Lee Jones were my postman.
