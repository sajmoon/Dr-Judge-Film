You go into the theater expecting the fizz of the first MIB movie, and you
come out feeling like you just experienced lukewarm and
flat.
The special affects were good, the actors were good, but overall the movie
was not. The storyline just wasn't there.
Maybe worth the price of a rental but certainly wouldn't encourage someone
to pay theater prices for this one.
