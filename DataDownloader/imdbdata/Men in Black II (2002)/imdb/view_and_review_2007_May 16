Agent Jay and Agent Kay: reunited and it feels so good. <br /><br />Or does it? Like a bad soap opera, the writers dug deep to devise some
cornball way around an established fact to give Agent Kay his memory
back and pair him up again with Agent Jay.<br /><br />They didn&#39;t do a real good job of outdoing or even matching the level
of MIB. There was the occasional humor and new aliens, but there was
nothing to set itself apart. <br /><br />But, then again, isn&#39;t that usually the formula for a sequel? Make a
movie similar to the first with a slight variation and just watch the
money trucks pull in.
