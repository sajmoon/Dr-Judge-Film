The first Men in Black is a great movie, still funny and entertaining
after all these years. Men in Black 2 was a disappointment back then,
and it&#x27;s still significantly weaker than the first one. Let&#x27;s start
with the positives, I like the villain, Serleena, sure, she&#x27;s no giant
bug in an Edgar-suit and is way more serious and just not funny, but
safe to say, she is a whole lot sexier, and I liked her sort of
vine-like, worm form. Johnny Knoxville is also a villain here, a
two-headed moron henchman, he&#x27;s actually pretty good, but he&#x27;s hardly
in it, and he just disappears completely at one point, with no
explanation given, he&#x27;s just gone, seems the director forgot all about
him. The movie tries a lot of stuff, has numerous aliens and
situations, and much of it, like the creatures in the locker, doesn&#x27;t
work at all. The worms are back, and I hate them, they are obnoxious,
loud and unfunny, but, they are nowhere near as annoying a Frank,
sorry, I can&#x27;t stand this character, he was only in the first movie for
a few, brief minutes, here, he&#x27;s J&#x27;s new partner for way longer than I
would&#x27;ve wanted, he talks and talks and talks, and nothing of what he
says is even marginally funny. But of course K returns, and the
chemistry feels a little off, Smith and Jones are still good, but
something felt a little strange, I think the script or inspired
ad-libbing just wasn&#x27;t there when they made the movie. The special
effects are pretty good, although a few moments have jarring mistakes,
like Jeff breaking out from the ground and knocks J to the side, then
the next shot, he&#x27;s completely gone. Rosario Dawson is no Linda
Fiorentino, she&#x27;s just there, nothing funny to do, she definitely is
significant to the plot, but I didn&#x27;t care about her character. David
Cross is very funny and gets the most laughs in his brief appearance,
Patrick Warburton is fun as well and the subway sequence is excellent.
I wish the final battle was, you know, exciting or awesome, but it
isn&#x27;t. Men in Black 2 is not a good sequel, it has some entertaining
parts, but the movie is a disappointment, I hope the third movie will
rekindle the franchise and be worthy of the original.
