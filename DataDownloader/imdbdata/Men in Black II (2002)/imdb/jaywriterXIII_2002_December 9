Not quite.  What's the problem with this film?  Well, let's go back to the
first MiB film; we had a very original angle for a sci-fi comedy, nobody
sitting down in the theatre for MiB had any idea what they were in for. 
Yeah, a movie about a secret organization who goes after aliens--given.  The
fact that every breath the film takes is to make a wisecrack at some
political figure, celebrity or sci-fi concept, that came as a pleasant
surprise.  MiB exceeded many people's expectations because no person, place,
or thing was safe from MiB's smart ass commentary.  <br /><br />Now we have MiB 2.  Now we have expectation carrying over from the first
film--we go from scene to scene, character to character imagining all the
funny stuff they can throw at us for a post office, a two headed alien, a
talking dog, etc . . . and we get *a* joke with each, then the film moves
on.  The humor the commentary on sci-fi and 'important people' is tame in
comparison to the first.  A lot of the scenes are funnier in the trailer
because the trailer happens to catch the punch line and spares us the other
15 minutes where we expect to be overwhelmed with the satire.  Not here. <br /><br />So what happened?  Did the writers run out of things to make fun of with the
whole MiB concept?  Is there, in fact, just as much satire as the first but
our expectations are higher this time around?  Who knows--I'm not about to
watch both back to back to find out.  Either way, going into a sequel you
have to recreate what made the first successful (which the filmmakers
semi-accomplished) and expand it into new territory to keep it from being
just a retread (which the makers did not do.)<br /><br />MiB 2 cannot escape the shadow of its predecessor, and it doesn't even try. 
It sits comfortably in the same premise, characters, jokes as the first one
and as a result loses its effectiveness . . . because the first one had an
edge--it had an original angle.  No one quite knew what MiB's target in
satire was, and it was in fact, everything.<br /><br />Jones and Smith reprise their roles very effectively; it would have been
nice to see Agent L return, alas, did not happen.  The writing doesn't seem
up to par with the first nor does the direction.  Elfman returns with an
effective score.  Overall, the film is pretty good so long as you don't
start expecting too much or hold it up against its predecessor.  Go figure.
