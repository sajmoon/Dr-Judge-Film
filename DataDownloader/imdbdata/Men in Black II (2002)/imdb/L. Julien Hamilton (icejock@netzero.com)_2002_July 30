Saying this movie sucked is giving it a good rating. I have never been more
disappointed in a movie, especially one that had such a build up. But It
was
better than ALI (which ain't saying much). There was no story just a
vehicle
to show off a new rap song. By the way did I mention that I can't stand
PUG'S!. Especially ones that sings, &quot;Who let the damn dogs out!&quot;
