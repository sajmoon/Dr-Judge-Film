I am very dissapointed in this film, I watched it at the cinema a few days
ago and the only time I laughed was when the dog was singing in the car,
the
rest was boring and I couldn't wait for it to finish!!! I think that it's
not a film worth watching...if you want a laugh, just download the
trailer.
