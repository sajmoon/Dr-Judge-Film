Normally, I like the original movies better than their sequels, but this is
an exception.  I enjoyed the special effects of this film, especially the
underground subway scene and the scene where the evil woman alien was
chasing Agents J and K.  I liked Frank the pug too, who didn't play much of
a role in the first movie.  If you don't care for weird humor like this,
then this movie isn't for you, but to the rest of you, I do suggest you see
this film.
