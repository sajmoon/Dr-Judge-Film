I saw this movie yesterday evening with 2 friends.
We laughed a lot, mainly because of the gags, the incredible situations in
which the characters are taken into, and because of the imagination of the
writers.<br /><br />But don't expect to find any coherence in the story, don't expect a
director's masterwork, and don't expect unforgettable acting...<br /><br />Entertaining is the best word to describe MIIB, and is the mood you should
have if you go to watch this movie !
