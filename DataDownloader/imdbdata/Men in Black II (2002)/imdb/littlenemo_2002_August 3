Every bad thing you've heard about this movie is true so I wont waste your
time repeating the same things. I also felt this movie was one big
advertisement..did you know Martha Stewart is even listed in the end credits
because for some unknown reason, she is seen twice on a television. And what
was the purpose for Micheal Jacksons cameo? No one in the audience laughed,
so if it was meant to be funny it didn't work. I think if they make a Men in
Black III it should go straight to video. 5/10
