When I saw MIB 1 it was a balmy summer night in Florida. It
seemed like a magical entertainment of alien whimsy  out on the
great American plain. Since then, the CIA /FBI have failed to spot
the  Al Qu'aida terrorists  flying planes into the Twin Towers and
the world consequently seems a sadder, less innocent place.<br /><br />And so the whole premise for MIB2 has gone - the fact that the US
had smart invincible agents to spot any world problems and solve
them effortlessly. Our comfort blanket has been removed. The rest
of the film is - yawn - special effects.<br /><br />We've moved on. We've got real. The world has changed and we
don't laugh so easily at stuff like this anymore.<br /><br />
