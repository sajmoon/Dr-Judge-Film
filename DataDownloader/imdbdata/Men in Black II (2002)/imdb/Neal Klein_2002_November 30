2002_November 30 

Perhaps my review of this movie is so positive simply because I expected
MIIB to suck. The professional reviews were not glowing in mid 2002, and I
actually missed seeing this film on its theatrical run because of them. The
fact is that MIIB is superb because it is SMART. It is self-satirizing,
subtle, sprightly-paced and well performed. Will Smith's seeming biting back
of the words that he just said is so delightful, and the film is not smeared
with profanity or unnecessary juvenile humor. Tommy Lee is snappy in his
delivery, and Rosario Dawson and Lara Flynn Boyle are not merely beautiful
but thoroughly smart.<br /><br />In writing this script, someone decided not to dumb down the story. Still,
the first film has some of the most memorable lines, where this movie has
some of the most memorable scenes. I admit that I laughed HARD when Frank
the dog did his extremely predictable but marvelously delivered jokes. Some
of the jokes are just chuckleworthy, but they're ALL fairly funny. And
Sonnenfeld did something that respected the audience's intelligence in his
direction. You can watch the movie more than once and catch many details
without getting bored.<br /><br />I cannot give MIIB too many points because it loses something for some cheap
jokes, but it's a film I recommend you see because it is so much more
smarter than its predecessor.
