For those who pick up the DVD and listen to the commentary track, be warned.
It's basically the nasel voiced director dronning on for 70%-80% of the film
about which shots are CGI and which are puppets. Really, he just sits there
going &quot;and that worm is CGI, but the close up of it's face is a rod puppet&quot;,
interesting for 5 minutes, boring as heck after the first half hour of
it!
