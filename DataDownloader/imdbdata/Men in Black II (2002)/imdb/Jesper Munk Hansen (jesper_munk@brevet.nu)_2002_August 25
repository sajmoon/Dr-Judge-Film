After all of the promotion for MIB 2, I thought that it would be reasonable
to see the movie.
Most of the sequels which is made is not in any way better than the first,
and this is no special case. The first movie about the &quot;Men in black&quot;, was
really great, it was fun, with a great story and lots of great action, but
though the sequel has lots of great comedy, the story is weak.<br /><br />I think that the main reason that MIB 2 didn&acute;t hold up to my expectations,
is that it was too short, 1.5 hours is not enough for everything that was
in
the movie. If they would have made the movie about half an hour longer, it
would have been easier to watch, the speed in the movie is too fast.<br /><br />But MIB 2 is not all bad, as mentioned earlier it has lots of great comedy.
Many trailers for films in the genre &quot;comedy&quot; show most of the fun stuff,
but not in this trailer, the trailer is really just a preview of some of
the
jokes. MIB 2 is really funny, which lifts the entire movie.<br /><br />MIB 2 was enjoyable for the moment.
