It's hard to be really disappointed in this movie. I mean, it tries so hard
to please. It's short (VERY short) and there's nothing about it that is
really horrible. To be sure, the performances are good. The dog is funny.
The aliens are freaky. It's everything we'd expect from the team that
brought us the original Men In Black, right? Well, no. Not exactly. There's
nothing new about this movie. Nothing that expands the world set up in the
first movie. It doesn't go off in any new directions. It's basically just a
rehashing of the original. Like I said, it's hard to NOT like a movie that
features Tommy Lee and Will doing what they do best. But by the same token,
it's really hard to LOVE this movie, either.
