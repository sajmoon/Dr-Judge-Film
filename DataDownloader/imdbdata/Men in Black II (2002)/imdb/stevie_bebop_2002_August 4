I think too many people forget the first MIB had the advantage of &quot;coming
in
under the radar,&quot; as Barry Sonnenfeld said. It was original, unexpected
and
deservedly a hit. It is, of course, impossible to repeat that originality.
Obviously expectations were way too high for some, yet there is a lot of
originality going on and a lot of good ideas. The premise of bringing K
back
is not contrived, and it also allows for some back-story, and that's
always
a good thing in a sequel. The story is strong with a good twist at the end
I
didn't see coming. The jokes come thick and fast and I completely disagree
that they're all in the trailers.<br /><br />The weak points were Lara Flynn Boyle, who was given the part at the last
minute so may not have had enough time to prepare, and Johnny
Knoxville.
