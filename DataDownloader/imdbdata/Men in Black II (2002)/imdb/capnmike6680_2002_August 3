I saw this movie the first day it came out and was hoping it would be as
good as the original with the same wit and action. Well I was partially
satisified as the movie was virtually the same as the original. The only
difference being that instead of Tommy Jones character recruiting Will
Smith's, it was reversed. All in all if you're a favor of either of the 2
actors or just would like to waste time I'd recommend the movie. But to
everyone else that wants to see an original movie my recommendation would
be
to stay home and rent the original.
