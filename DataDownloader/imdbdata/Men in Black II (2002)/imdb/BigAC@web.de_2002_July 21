First I must say this movie is a very good follow to the first part. The
strength (comedy,action) of the old men in black part is still in this
movie
and without Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones this movie wouldn't be so good.
In the movie you fell no second boring and it's a really good popcorn
movie
