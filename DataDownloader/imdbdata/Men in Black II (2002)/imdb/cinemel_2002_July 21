Tommie Lee Jones and Will Smith reprise their roles as Agents J &amp; K in Barry
Sonnenfeld's sequel to the enormously successful Men in Black of 5 years
ago. This time their roles are reversed. Will Smith portrays the veteran
anti-alien agent and Jones is the naive postal worker whose
knowledge of aliens has been neuralized (wiped out). When the earth is
threatened by Lara Flynn Boyle (as the new alien villain), Jones is brought
out of &quot;retirement&quot; and restored to partnership with Smith. It sounds like
it should work, but it is only fitfully amusing and not very exciting.
However, the special effects are even more elaborate than in the original,
but it isn't enough. The only thing that saves the film is a canine alien
agent who has a leaning towards singing songs like &quot;I Will Survive&quot; and &quot;Who
let the dogs out?&quot; He steals the show from the stars. The movie itself is
mercifully short (88 minutes, with about 10 minutes of credits making the
body of the film only 78-80 min. long, or short, as it were). So if you
liked the original, you might enjoy this one. It just isn't fresh or
original, just a money-making rehash.
