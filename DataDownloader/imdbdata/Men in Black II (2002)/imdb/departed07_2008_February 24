The original &quot;Men In Black&quot; was truly a one-of-a-kind entertainment
filled with laughter, thrills and science fiction references all over
the place. Just like many blockbuster films, a sequel must take place.<br /><br />Why? After K (Tommy Lee Jones) is retired and away from the M.I.B.
headquarters, J (Will Smith) has taken over K&#39;s position where he&#39;s
nothing but a rebel without a cause. In the original movie, Will Smith
was just like many of his other characters who didn&#39;t know what the
hell was going on until he knew and stood up to the plate to take
action. Here he&#39;s a wild cannon knowing most of New York along with
having partners that leave him when they screw-up.<br /><br />The new villain in town is played by Lara Flynn Boyle an alien, like
Edgar from the original, that takes the shape and form of those they
contact. In the original the alien ripped Edgar&#39;s body apart only to
take the skin where Lara&#39;s character is like the T-1000 from T2 where
all she has to do is look at the object and transform into it.<br /><br />After a witness (Rosario Dawson) sees her boss inflated like a balloon
by an alien, it&#39;s up to J to protect her and reinforce Tommy Lee
Jones&#39;s character into action.<br /><br />There were a couple of chuckles, but there wasn&#39;t enough scenes I could
remember that I cared for nor care about this movie.
