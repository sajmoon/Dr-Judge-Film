This movie is an example of how the rating system is totally messed up.  MIB
II seems quite appropriate for kids.  It is mostly silly, rather than
genuinely scary.  The special effects are a lot of fun.  There is some
violence but is cartoonish in nature.  The plot is pretty simple.  Why is it
PG-13?  Because a lady appears in her underwear at one point?  Pretty
arbitrary.  <br /><br />Star Wars on the other hand has non-stop violence and is genuinely scary. 
It is only rated PG.  But, as a mother, I'd much rather have my kids (9 &amp;
12) watch this one than watch Star Wars.  MIB II is much lighter, more kid
friendly, and less violent.<br /><br />Why does Tommy Lee Jones get top billing on this movie?  Will Smith is
clearly the lead and a great one at that.  I really enjoyed watching him. 
He acts well and has an enchanting, light-hearted charisma; plus he's
awfully cute.  Tommy Lee Jones is very stony-faced and not at all
accessible.<br /><br />I loved the CG characters.  They were wonderfully creative and entertaining.
