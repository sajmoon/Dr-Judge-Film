2002_July 24 

I admit it. I am to blame for films like this getting made. But I will not
share this burden alone. Every single human being who rushed out and
bought
a ticket to MIB II on July 3, 2002 must hang their heads in shame with me.
We are the reason why Hollywood has become intellectually bankrupt.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the film. In fact, I really enjoyed the
film.
Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are brilliant comedic actors. Ditto for the
supporting cast. Rip Torn, Patrick Warburton, Tony Shalhoub, and David
Cross
are talented enough to carry the film themselves.<br /><br />The set design is spectacular. Who wouldn't love going to work each day at
the MIB headquarters? Rick Baker's special effects make-up is amazing
enough
to convince me that aliens actually do exist. He should clear some space
on
his mantle for yet another Academy Award.<br /><br />On the surface, this film is perfect. It's a classic. So, what is my
problem
with the film? Well, if you examine both the original MIB and this flick
closely, you will discover that they are pretty much identical.<br /><br />It appears that the producers for MIB II took some white out and went to
town with the script for the original film. They just took the same
situations from the first one and switched the characters around. Will
Smith's Agent J is now the burnt out veteran Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K was
in
the original, while Jones has now assumed the role of the astonished
rookie.
This is not character growth. This is laziness on the part the
screenwriter.
The locales are similar. The villain has changed, but has the same modus
operadi and objective of the first MIB's evil doer. The beginning, the
middle, the climax, and the end of MIB II are also astonishingly similar
to
its predecessor.<br /><br />I can just imagine the conversation that the people behind this
blockbuster
had before it was green-lit. It probably went something like this . ..<br /><br />Executive #1: &quot;O.K. people, MIB made all of us richer than Paul McCartney.
Where do we go from here?&quot;<br /><br />Executive #1's assistant: &quot;Well, you could try something new and
original.&quot;<br /><br />Executive #1: &quot;Go get me some coffee and then clean out your cubicle.
You're
fired.&quot;<br /><br />Executive #2: &quot;Ding! Ding! I have an idea! Let's make MIB
II!&quot;<br /><br />Executive #1: &quot;Brilliant! Who can we get to write the screenplay?&quot;<br /><br />Executive #3: &quot;How about Shane Black? He wrote `Lethal Weapon 1 and
2'.&quot;<br /><br />Executive #2: &quot;No can do. He pretty much retired after writing `The Long
Kiss Goodnight.' Now he spends most of his time on a bed of money,
surrounded by a lot of beautiful women.&quot;<br /><br />Executive #3: &quot;How about Ehren Kruger?&quot;<br /><br />Executive #2: &quot;Nope. I have him writing an update of  `The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre' for today's generation. We're going for a PG-13
rating.&quot;<br /><br />Executive #1: &quot;Wait! I think my assistant has the script of the original
MIB
saved on her computer in Microsoft Word format! We can just switch the
names
around and we'll have an entirely new movie! The audience won't
care!&quot;<br /><br />Executive #2: &quot;Score! After the money rolls in, I'll finally be able to
buy
France!&quot;<br /><br />Executive #3: &quot;Um, didn't you just fire your assistant?&quot;<br /><br />Executive #1: &quot;Hmm, you're right. I'll talk to my ten-year-old son. He
should be able to churn out a script for us by Monday.&quot;<br /><br />We caused this, people! If we keep forking over our hard-earned cash to
view
more of the same, the studios will never give us anything fresh and
original. I love these characters and I wish to see their adventures
continue. All I ask is that the screenwriters of the inevitable MIB III
come
up with something new. Perhaps J and K can travel to another world in
defense of Earth. Maybe the film can open with the MIB's attempting take
back control of our planet after a devastating full-scale alien invasion.
I
don't know. Just give me something, anything, other than the same old
ideas.<br /><br />Otherwise, I will probably just sell out, again, and pay $10.00 bucks to
see
same film, only with a Roman numeral three at the end of the title. Oh,
the
shame.
