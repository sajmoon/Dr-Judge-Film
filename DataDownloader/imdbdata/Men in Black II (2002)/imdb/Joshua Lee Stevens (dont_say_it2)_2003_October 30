Why do all filmmakers think that if they make one successful film they have
to make another? That's what you'll be asking yourself after you watch this
movie, that in my opion should've never been made. It's just more alien
shooting and spraying goo. This movie was funny at times, I'll give it that,
but if they were going to make MIB II in the first place they should've came
up with a better plot, and try to make it more original. Instead they just
did the same things over again and it worked. Everyone, including me, went
and saw it. My advice, rent the original, or if you want to see the best
sci-fi movie rent one of the first two Alien films.
