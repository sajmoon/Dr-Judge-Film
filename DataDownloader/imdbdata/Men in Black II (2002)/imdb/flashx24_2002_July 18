i thoroughly enjoyed the first one. this movie was not even one and a half
hours long. a complete waste of $11. i would not reccomend this movie to
anyone. one on the annoying things about the movie, was that will smith
(ex-nypd) keeps using these high tech terms for guns, and just comes off
as
a hard ass instead of the meek, funny person as in MIB I.maybe next time
you
could make the movie a little bit longer and realistic.
