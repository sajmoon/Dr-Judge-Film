Men in Black II was, to say the least, bad. To this day, I really have no
idea why I saw it on opening weekend. I guess it was the hype talking to
me
in my sleep. The movie had no heart. Will Smith received somewhere in the
neighborhood of $20 million to basically go through his lines. There was
no
uniqueness about the movie that made the original Men In Black so fun to
watch. I think Tommy Lee Jones and Lara Flynn Boyle had the exact same
face
the entire movie. It really seemed like the movie was made just for money,
and it appears to be working in that aspect. Sub-par sequel to a
blockbuster
movie + holiday weekend = big money.<br /><br />The only time that my friends and I laughed during the movie was during
the
appearance of David Cross. He steals the scene and perhaps the movie. If
you
haven't seen him in Mr. Show, I suggest you track it down. Very funny
stuff,
unlike this brainless drivel.<br /><br />4 out of 10
