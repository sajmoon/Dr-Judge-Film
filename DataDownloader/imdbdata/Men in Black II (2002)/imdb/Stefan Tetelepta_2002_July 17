90 million dollars were spend for MIB2. The biggest part went to Smith and
Jones. But they didn't deliver. There's no chemistry. There is also no story
and no fun. Enough aliens, but imho to much of that.
And Lara Flyn Boyle didn't do a good job, Selena is not a memorable
character. She's quit blank, just like the movie. I don't think Famke
Janssen regrets she left the project. 6/10.
