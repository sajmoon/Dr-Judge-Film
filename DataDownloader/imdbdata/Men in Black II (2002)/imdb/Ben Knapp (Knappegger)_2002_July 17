Funny mainstream action/comedy. Part one did it, and delivered. Part two is
flawed by either wanting too much or simply having no ideas. About
anything.
Or maybe both.<br /><br />Sad fact remains: part one was a good ride of shallow yet entertaining
hollywood cinema. Part two is a strange mixture of
action/comedy/slapstick/philosophical
je-ne-sais-quoi. Shame, really.
