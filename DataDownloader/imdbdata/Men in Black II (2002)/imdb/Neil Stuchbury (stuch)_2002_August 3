Well, I saw this film today. And I thought once again the old stereotype,
sequels are usually worse, came into to play once more. It was not as good
as the original, not nearly (except maybe the SFX, but that was to be
expected).<br /><br />Firstly, the things that really annoyed me. Johnny Knoxville's character was
the typical idiot side-kick to the villain, whose main purpose was for ten
year old kids who stay up late, to stand up and shout: &quot;Look it's him from
Jackass.&quot;<br /><br />The villain herself was disappointing, and not as, for lack of a better
word, &quot;interesting&quot; as &quot;Edgar&quot;. I think her abilities i.e. the snakes or
whatever they were. Were just an excuse to show some SFX.<br /><br />Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, had lost all of their comic chemistry that
was there in the first film.<br /><br />It was too short. Maybe to keep children entertained and not
bored.<br /><br />However there were some good points. Will Smith did keep me amused, and not
Tommy Lee Jones also. But not at the same time, as mentioned earlier. The
story gave K a little more depth and background.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't really like it. But no-one can give an opinion until they
have seen it. So go see it and hopefully you will think the same as me.
