The first one was clever, engaging, inventive and most of all funny. This
had a great responsability of keeping the reputation of the blockbusting
first movie, and many years passed until they found out a good script to do
it. The result is something which verges on deception. You love it and hate
it in equal amounts: although the running time helps to create the illusion
that you actually want more, what happens here is the usual Hollywood sequel
with its usual and more regular flaw: the feeling that we are seeing
something rushed to happen. But my greatest challenge as a viewer was
getting over the dull comic timings, which sometimes had everyone in the
theater completely quiet. So you see, this is not the fascinating fest that
was the first movie, but anyway there are some funny things about the MIB
gadgetry and you will laugh with that dog and many other moments in the
movie. But of course, the flaws are there, and that subliminal love story is
unconvincing, and a near-flop. But I guess that's what happens with some
sequels...
