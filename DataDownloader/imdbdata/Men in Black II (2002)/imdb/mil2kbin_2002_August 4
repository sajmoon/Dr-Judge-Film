I went to see MIB II really wanting to like it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the
first MIB and hoped that the sequel would be just as entertaining, but alas
it was not to be. It seems that &quot;they&quot; took everything that &quot;we&quot; liked
about
the first MIB and just repeated it again and again and again in MIB II, but
they forgot that no one laughs at the same joke twice (let alone three or
four times).  In the first MIB we laughed when the alien shook Agent J
around as she gave birth.  We laughed when J was tossed about in the
speeding car.  And we laughed when Agent K shot the alien's head off and it
grew right back. But in MIB II we yawned at these same antics replayed.
MIB
II hasn't turned me off on sequels (I REALLY enjoyed Toy Story 2!), but I
can certainly understand why a lot of people groan when they hear the word
sequel
