All of the good jokes are blown in the trailer and the whole film is nothing
more than a rehash of the original, which also had all of the good jokes
blown in the trailer.<br /><br />The worst part was that the filmmakers essentially slapped the film together
with knowledge that with an aggressive marketing campaign, people would show
up to see the movie in droves.  People showed up to see the movie in droves,
and it shamefully became one of the biggest grossers of the
summer.
