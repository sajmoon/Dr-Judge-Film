This just in: &quot;Sources just declared the break-up of one powerful duo- MIB.
More at 6 o'clock&quot;<br /><br />Okay, what the hell is going on in Hollywood? Already I've seen enough bad
sequels that would last me for a lifetime. Every movie sequel I watch, I
would always come out of the movie theaters disappointed. Haven't they
learned that most sequels DO NOT SURVIVE!
Why do most people behind the camera thinks that if they make one great
movie, the next logical step is to make a sequel. This formula never
works!<br /><br />Men In Black 2 is one of the many trashy sequels ever made. The first one
was already a hit, why follow it up with this? Will Smith and Tommy Lee
Jones is one powerful, funny duo, but in this film, they played some really
tasteless, boring, dry characters. The duo magic that was present on the
first part is now gone. Combined this with one terrible, poor storyline and
you got one recipe for a &quot;Sequel Disaster&quot;.<br /><br />To all producers, writers involve, please let's just leave this great films
alone. Making a sequel is one great risk and almost everytime, it doesn't
work. Take a lesson.<br /><br />3 stars out of 10.
