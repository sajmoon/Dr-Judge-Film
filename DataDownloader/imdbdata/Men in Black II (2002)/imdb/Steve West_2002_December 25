I must have been in the right frame of mind to watch this (which always
helps), I thought it was more polished than the original. Where I felt I was
let down toward the end of the first one (seemed to build up to something
but never really delivered) this one was straight out solve the current
crisis of the day and see what the MIB crowd are up to 5 years
later.<br /><br />With the abundant hype of the original absent I had no prior expectations
and was able to better appreciate the Sonnenfeld humour and enjoy sequences
like the dog singing part of &quot;I will survive&quot;, or people on a train platform
not even batting an eyelid when a huge worm whizzes by. It's good to see
that MIIB is a proper sequel and not just one commissioned by a studio
because the first one made a lot of money. Definately one to rent or buy on
DVD.
