I was supposed to see another movie when I caught this inferior replica of
&quot;Men in Black&quot;.  It was sold out, the weather was terrible, and it would
take us 45 minutes to get back to our hotel room.  We decided to see MIB2
and sneak into the other movie afterwards.  This is the exact same movie
as
the first one, less the light-hearted wit.  This is the definitive
sell-out
sequel.  The writers either were too worried that deviating from the first
movie's plot and dialogue would turn audiences away, or they were too lazy
to come up with something new.  This would play well for someone who
hasn't
seen the first MIB, but as a sequel it is awful.  To top it off, the movie
that I wanted to see was was sold out for the next showing.  They even had
attendants checking stubs.  What a terrible day.
