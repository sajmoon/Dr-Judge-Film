Agent J needs help so he is sent to find Agent K and restore his
memory.<br /><br />If you have read my review of the original, I did love it. It was a
parody of parodies, with fast-moving humor and memorable scenes, cast,
and characters. With a sequel, I admittedly had some sort of
expectation. The sequel, for one, is directed by the same director of
the first. By this, we can expect some of the same and of course how he
wanted the sequel to be. Secondly, we have the same cast. Obviously, we
can have the same formula with the humor and laughs just as the
original. As I sat down to watch, I kept asking myself WHY did they
chose to do this? WHY is this happening? And lastly, WHY did the
director chose the battle the original? The only answer could be he
lost it. The humor is kind of the same of the original: mildly vulgar,
mildly presented. The problem with the sequel is that it tries to hard
to make us feel like the first did. Of course, we have the same flaws
as the first, but seems like the director wanted to double the amount
and make ourselves *ASK* ourselves why? The acting was a little dumbed
down, and surprisingly Tommy Lee Jones did a horrible job. Will Smith
presented a better performance than him but maybe it was a bad day.
Everything else is sort of like a throwback to the original, but sadly
it&#x27;s projected way worse. We have a few funny cameos, but none of them
redeem the bad things. We have a few funny jokes, but most of them are
forced. We have some cool scenes, but mostly they are all dumbed down.
So let me put it this way: if you took the original, sort of took all
the bad scenes, then sliced this one in half, and filled the sliced
half with the bad scenes, you have Men in Black II. I didn&#x27;t hate, but
I didn&#x27;t like it. I don&#x27;t recommend, and the film deserves the 5
rating. Instead of watching this, take all the bad things out of the
first, then re-watch that. It&#x27;ll be a much better experience. 5/10.
