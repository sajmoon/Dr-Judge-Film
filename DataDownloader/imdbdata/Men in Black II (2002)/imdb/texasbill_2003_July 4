2003_July 4 

Let me say up front that before exploring the DVD goodies, I watched the
movie straight up with no preformed prejudice.  And yea, it was painful.
I
might say that the plot/script was done by a fifth-grader, but that would
be
unfair: no, there are plenty of fifth-graders that could come up with
plots
that blow this away.  Ouch!  (Disclaimer: I am a critical filmwatching
adult, which probably counts one one-thousandth of the teenage money this
film soaked in.)<br /><br />That said, I endured the entire length and proceeded to the DVD treasures.
And yea, they pay off handsomely, if you have a bug for the moviemaking
process.  Extensive attention is given to items such as score, lighting,
blue-screen, makeup, sound(foley), puppeteering, and CG interplay.  And
for
me the big payoff was the Sonnenfeld director's commentary, with nonstop
narration of every second of the film.  You'd think that this would grow
old
after a while, but at least for me, I found something interesting and
educational in everything he discussed, from start of film to finish.
(You
will have to get past his whiny voice, though it's not as bad as the guy
on
Alf :))<br /><br />Stuff like this can yield a true appreciation of the awesome breadth and
complexity of successfully producing a Hollywood feature film.  Though not
really demonstrated on this DVD, there is also a hint of the chaos and
insanity in making it all work.  If you are not a director or producer but
intend to ever be one, the DVD goodies have stuff you really ought to
know.<br /><br />After taking it all in, I have a greater respect for MIB II, in that they
pulled off what they did.  It's a shame that such a tremendous amount of
work and investment was applied to making the film, while the script/plot
was just some garbage thrown together to fit the pre-established motif
from
the first film.  I would hope that lessons were learned in the biz from
MIB,
about throwing massive resources into a stupid story -- but nay,
conventional Hollywood wisdom will prevail: &quot;Thou shalt produceth CRAP for
sequels to blockbusters ... and thou shalt becometh rich.  And this is
Good.&quot;<br /><br />P.S. There is a cute animation short on disk 1 called &quot;The Chubb Chubbs&quot;
that might be worth investing a couple of minutes in; and if you have a
DVD
reader on your PC, I'm told that the video game on the DVD is pretty
cool.
