Sure, maybe this movie doesn't have much of a plot, but I thought it was a
lot funnier than the first one.  I can't remember a part where I wasn't
laughing. My favorite part is the aliens in the locker that say &quot;Oh K can
you see by the dawn's early light...&quot;   :-)<br /><br />I also liked the cartoon short I watched in front of this movie: &quot;The
Chub-Chubs.&quot; I hope they include that on the dvd!
