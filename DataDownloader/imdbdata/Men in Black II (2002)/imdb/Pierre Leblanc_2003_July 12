This movie was terrible.  Utterly unbelievable.  Not funny.  boring. 
Perhaps, because I liked Men In Black so much, I was so disappointed by the
sequel.<br /><br />It was as if they took all the intelligence out of it, took all the mystery
out of it, and then tried to replace those elements with Will Smith's
ability to be funny.  But then they forgot to ask Will Smith what was
funny.<br /><br />They ended up with no humour, no mystery, no believability, no .. I could go
one.  All they had left was Will Smith acting &quot;cool&quot;, which I think even he
could agree, given the script, was lame.  It was a B-movie... unless there
is such a thing as a D-movie.
