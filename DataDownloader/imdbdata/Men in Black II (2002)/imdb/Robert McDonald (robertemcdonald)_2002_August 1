I liked the first film and watched it again before going to see the sequel
and this is one of the rarities where the sequel is better than the
original, and by a big margin in my opinion.<br /><br />There seems to be much more humour in this one. It also moves along at a
quick pace.<br /><br />I will buy the dvd of this film whereas I didn't bother with the 1st. It
deserves an easy 8/10 and the first was maybe a 6/10.<br /><br />Enjoy it! It is good!
