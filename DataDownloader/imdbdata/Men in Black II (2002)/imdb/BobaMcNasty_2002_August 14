This is just a lame rehash of the first one, this time with less wit, lame
SFX, and an endless array of product placements.  This has to be the most
expensive Sprint commercial I've ever seen, and no, I'm not going to be
sucked into a P.O.S. cell phone.<br /><br />The only thing it has going for it is Lara Flynn Boyle, that's
it.<br /><br />The chemistry between Jones and Smith is tired, and so is the writing.
Please let there not be a MIB III.
