In the first Men in Black, the audience was introduced to new concepts
of how life can take on different forms. That people are not always
human beings. So either this sequel is trying to still convince us that
this idea remains the same or the screenwriters thought that no one
remembered what happened five years ago when the first film came out.
That&#x27;s the disappointing part, however, the good part is that most of
original elements are kept the same with some different features.<br /><br />Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back as the Men in Black, well at
least they both are when half of the film is over. That&#x27;s right, what
could&#x27;ve been a great follow up movie from start to finish, ended up
being an OK sequel. The story revolves around that Smith needs
information from Jones, the problem is that Jones&#x27; memory was wiped
from the first one. So did the producers of this film think reviving
Jones&#x27; memory was a new idea? If that was the case, they never
should&#x27;ve erased Jones&#x27; memory in the first place. There&#x27;s no logic
behind the thinking here.<br /><br />What really makes the first half of the film really silly is how Jones
is portrayed. The first Men in Black (1997) was great because Jones
came off as a callous, unforgiving mentor and it was funny to see Smith
try and figure out what was going on. Now the roles are switched, Smith
knows what he&#x27;s talking about while Jones is lost amongst the clouds.
I&#x27;ll admit there were some funny parts but there weren&#x27;t enough. In a
way, this film could&#x27;ve played as the first one (if the other had never
been released). Some of the scenes even resemble previous ones too
well. Plus some key things that made the first one funny were left out.
For example, the &#x22;Noisy Cricket&#x22; Smith used, made him fly backward. In
this film Jones uses it (more than once) and he doesn&#x27;t go flying
anywhere. Alright, who forget to keep things the same here?<br /><br />What did work in this film are the special effects, the dialog, the
music and the last half of this film in general. Since the budget was
ramped up on this sequel much of the special effects look even better
than of the first one. The creatures are more interesting to look at
too. My favorite alien is Jeff the subway worm. Nothing can get scarier
than that, especially if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Men in Black! The
dialog is kept the same as the first one, which is great. Smith still
has all the cool funny sayings while Jones has all the intellectual
funny lines. Even Zed has a few comedic moments unlike the first one.<br /><br />Finally, just like the last soundtrack, Danny Elfman composed the music
for this film. I&#x27;m glad not everything had changed. It still has its
science fiction feeling to it. As for the last half of the movie, its
just great to watch because things go back to how they REALLY used to
be from the first film. For the most part, keeping the formula the same
in films is a good thing. There are exceptions to the rule but this
finally catches up with itself in the last half. That&#x27;s when this
sequel truly looks good. <br /><br />Its story is uninspired for the first half of its running time but once
it passes that mark, things go back to the way they originally were.
Hardcore fans will enjoy it but to expect something really entertaining
for regular audiences will be setting a standard that is too high for
this sequel to reach.
