This movie is a good example of great fun. Isn't that what movies should be
for? Total entertainment.
Not so good acting, good direction, good jokes, good special effects,
nothing to think about. I specially liked the sci-fi geek scene. It reminded
me of a lot of people that write in this forums!
Obviously, if you want to think or be inspired by the message of a movie
this movie is not for you. 7/10
