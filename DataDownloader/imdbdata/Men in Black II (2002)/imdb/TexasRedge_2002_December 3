Here come the Men in Black(Again)...and this time there adventure in htis
film is almost identicle to the first one(only that I liked the first one
better)<br /><br />Am I the only person is starting to notice all the corperate commercails
in
the background of films.... because this one had more of them than any
other
film I've ever seen. Sprint PCS, IBM Computers, Burger King, Victorias
Secret, Rayban, Mercedes Benz, and Reebok --all got thier commercails
cleverly placed in this film.. I'm starting to notice more and more
background commercails in films...example did you see the Cingular
Wireless
commercail in Spiderman, or the Lexus commercail in Minority Report? if
you
didn't notice - trust me,they are there - but Men In Black 2 had more
background commercails than any film I've ever seen.<br /><br />Overall - I give this film 4 out of 10 stars, mainley because it was just
like  the 1st movie, the music sucked, and there was absolutely no emotion
in this film, just some really cool specail effects and some dry humor
that
isn't funny, your kids will like it, but you may not
