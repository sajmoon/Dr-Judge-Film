When the talking dog outshines Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith there is a
problem.  The special effects were good, but done before.  The plot was less
than substandard and it seemed the actors were there for their paychecks,
nothing more, nothing less.  Save your money and re-watch the original
MIB.
