There is a fine line between good and bad movies, and usually if a movie is
good enough I tend to call it a film. When it comes to movies and Cinema in
general, I tend to be rather generous in giving scores to movies. Only if
something is truly terrible will I give it extremly low points, but usually
there are one or two redeeming qualities. (E.G. my Battlefield Earth
review). That is not this case with this &quot;movie.&quot; Why is it called even a
&quot;movie&quot;? I don't know. Why does this even have more then one star at IMDb?
Beats me. One word describs this film: appalling. Where is the script? Did
they hire monkeys to make up these jokes? Wait.. what jokes? They aren't
even funny. As for the acting, it barely makes it past bad, but it isn't
bad. It's the only thing that saves this one, the fact that they kinda
tried. Everything else is revolting. Barry Sonefield seems to have his mind
on making money rather then making something worth $9. Note Steven Speilberg
produced this one too... The chemisty between Agent K and Agent J really
falls apart when they meet. Oh and the special effects are decent as well.
The ending of this &quot;movie&quot; is supposed to be sad, and I cried. Happy tears,
that it was OVER! This is the epitomy of cinematic hell. Don't even try to
stop watching it, before you move it'll be over. The worst movie ever made..5/10
