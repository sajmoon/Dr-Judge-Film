It seemed that the film relied on gags from the first film instead of
going
for new, more original jokes (the noisy cricket, &quot;last suit&quot; line, among
others).  Even the new jokes seemed that they were meant to be the jokes
of
the moment, just way too many pop culture references.  In 5 years, will
anyone get these jokes?  Probably, but they won't be nearly as funny as
they
are now.  Overall, MiB2 seems just like a sequel for the sake of making
more
money.  The scantily clad villian, pop culture jokes, and fairly
unoriginal
plot all add up to one thing:  godd for the short term but no long term
lasting power.
