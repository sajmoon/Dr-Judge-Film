Oh fudge to the critics! <br /><br />If you want to laugh with the stars, or carry moon beams home in anchovy
cans, then you really should transport home Men in Black II.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith with Rosario Dawson team up to save the world
from one of the most sinister aliens ever (almost James Bond like
(ha!)'heavys'), the ruthless replicant &quot;Serleena&quot; (Lara Flynn
Boyle).<br /><br />Pay close attention to this slapstick, fast talking, unearthly (yet earthly)
satire, and you'll find yourself 'punching' away at the rewind button to
'laugh-it-again'.<br /><br />If you desire something different, (although no longer original), and are
tired of super heroes, wars or super spies, then have a 'cook's tour' with
more of the universal good, bad and ugly of the universe, with Men in Black
II.
