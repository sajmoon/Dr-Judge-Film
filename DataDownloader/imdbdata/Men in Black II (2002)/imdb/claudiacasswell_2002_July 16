Men in Black II was a very disappointing sequel. There was absolutely
nothing new to offer -- same basic plot, same special effects. The movie
contained a few funny lines but it was not nearly as humorous as the
original. The acting was good, as one would expect from Will Smith and Tommy
Lee Jones, but not good enough to pull this dud of a movie out of the
dumpster.<br /><br />
