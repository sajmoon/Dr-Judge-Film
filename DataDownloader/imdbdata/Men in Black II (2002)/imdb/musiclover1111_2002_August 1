Ok, the majority of us out there all know that this was a bad movie, I
mean
really, it took 20 minutes into the movie to get a laugh out of me, and I
laugh easily.
It had the potential, but in the end I was really
disappointed. I mean it was a nice idea that there could have been a good
sequel to a great movie, but that dream was shattered.
