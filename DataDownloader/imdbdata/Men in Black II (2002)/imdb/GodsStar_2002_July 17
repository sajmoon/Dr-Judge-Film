I cannot believe that we waited five years between sequels for
this.<br /><br />There's nothing tackier about breathing life into a sequel than
resurrecting
a PAST cast member but I was willing to let my dreams of watching Linda
Fiorentino working as Will Smith's new partner go in the hopes that Tommy
Lee and Will could pull off another good run.  Agent &quot;L&quot; is never seen and
her character is dismissed with a passing line.<br /><br />The premise of the film was formula but well delivered.  The MIB had an
encounter with some life forms over twenty years ago.  They carry the life
source of their planet around with them to keep it safe from harm.   Since
some evil dame chases them across the cosmos to steal &quot;the light&quot; from them
and rule their planet, they asked MIB if they would hold onto it but they
refused, as it is against the code to put Earth in danger over some other
planet's problems.  Man&#133;if only  the U.S. government would do that&#133;but I
digress.<br /><br />The &quot;good&quot; guys get away &amp; MIB throws the evil woman off
course.<br /><br />For some reason only Tommy Lee has the key to saving the world and must be
DE-neuralized  back into action as Agent &quot;K&quot; when the evil Serleena
returns.
Serleena believes that &quot;the light&quot; is still on Earth and Agent &quot;K&quot; knows
where it is&#133;and away we go.<br /><br />The special effects are great.  As if we ever had a doubt.  And that's
pretty much it.  Aside from a few jokes and gags here and there the film is
ALL hype and no action.  The snappy dialogue and the chemistry between Will
and Tommy that we saw in the first MIB are gone.  They look like they are
both under contract and HAVE to be there.<br /><br />The sets of the MIB headquarters are the star of this show.  It looks like
some serious work went into the neo-jet set look as well as spending some
big money on a tangible environment.  There's not so much matte painting
and
CGI work in the film and it's nice to see.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if even children will be disappointed by this
fiasco.<br /><br />I'd wait for cable/satellite on this one, People.  I'm not sure if it even
justifies a rental.  1 and &frac12; stars out of four.
