Some time after the second MIB movie was in the movies, I read more
than six comments that reacted negatively to MIB II. When I saw MIB II
the first time, I was not as impressed. Now it seems that I like MIB II
more and I see it more often. I love both movies. In many ways the
second flick was better. Y&#x27;all are always saying more bang for the
buck, well, I thought MIB II had it. In many ways the movie was
serious. The earth was about to be destroyed, and that&#x27;s an old plot
line, I realized. But the movie was funny almost all the way through.
There was romance, some drama, action, thrills, everything you would
desire from a good sci-fi. Agent J is there with his normal urban humor
you might expect from his buddy in Bad Boys, but still prevailing as
the smart agent policing the Earth for criminal aliens. Serleena is a
handful. The key plot in MIB II is the light of Zartha. Serleena in her
zest and evil kills the pizza guy, but the rapist, well, he gets what
he deserves I think. Serleena has a varied appetite.<br /><br />Frank the pug(a dog) gets a starring role in this installment of Men In
Black. Seems pretty smart, but cannot sing Gloria Gaynor very well. But
it&#x27;s funny. He finds himself a prisoner in the MIB headquarters.<br /><br />There are a lot more special effects here, more alien characters. A lot
of them turn up at Jeeb&#x27;s Joint, where Agent K has gone with Agent J.
Agent K is using Jeeb&#x27;s deneuralyzer, powered by an Evinrude outboard
motor. Later, J and K run into Newton and his girlfriend at their video
store, and the story thickens.<br /><br />A lot of fun, this movie is. The key is not to take any of it
seriously, and yes, TLJ has probably made better movies, movies a lot
older than this. But this one&#x27;s fun, especially the 10,000 foot long
worm.<br /><br />.
