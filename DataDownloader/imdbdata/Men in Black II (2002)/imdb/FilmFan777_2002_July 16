Shortly, seems as though the only thing going for this film is two things...
1, they made a very good first film. 2nd, the dog. Other then that, this
film was a total waste of time and money for me. There was no magic between
the characters. Just seemed to be going through the motions and banking on
the fact they had a great first film. The script was adholecent and the
directing...I thought you were supposed to get better with experience
however it seems this director gets worse.
