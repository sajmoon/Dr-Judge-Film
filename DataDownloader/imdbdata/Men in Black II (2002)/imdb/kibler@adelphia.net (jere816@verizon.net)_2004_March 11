Men in Black II (2002) Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Lara Flynn Boyle,
Rosario Dawson, Rip Torn, Johnny Knoxville, Tony Shalhoub, Patrick
Warburton, Tim Blaney, D: Barry Sonnenfeld.<br /><br />Remember it was Jones' last time as a MIB agent when all of his memory was
`neutralized' (at the end of the first film), but Smith returns with a new
mission to seek The Light of Zartha-a powerful doodad wanted by an evil
alien (Boyle) disguised in Victoria Secret lingerie. When it requires
Jones'
help, it'll be hard familiarizing him and getting him `dressed' in black
again.<br /><br />'Men in Black II' doesn't feel as much as a sequel as it does a revisit.
It
revisits to the original film by not adding much else. Rosario Dawson,
Lara
Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville are used to no effect, but the dog is funny.
This is so unnecessary and unnecessarily confusing, but still stocks some
clever ideas of the original, like the engaging star duo, but even they
aren't given much to do here. The movie mercifully doesn't prolong its
revisit. Look for Sonnenfeld as the neutralized father.<br /><br />Running Time: 88 minutes and rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and
some
provocative humor.<br /><br />**
