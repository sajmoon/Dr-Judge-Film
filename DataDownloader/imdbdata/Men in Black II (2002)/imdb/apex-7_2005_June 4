2005_June 4 
Hmm... what to make of this... Well, I loved MIB - I even remember
paying good money to watch it a second time around in a hotel room in
Belgium. Reading some of the comments about this MIB2 on IMDb it seems
a lot of people were bombarded with promotional material when this came
out, but bizarrely ( I do live in the 21st century ) this completely
passed me by and the first I knew about MIB2 was in the local
supermarket on the remaindered shelves.<br /><br />And there we have the difference - with my expectations set at zero I
loved this film. Rosario Dawson looks a babe, Will is Will and plays
with a post-post-modern self deprecating irony only as he can. It
reminded me a bit of gremlins 2 whereby much of the humour is taking a
wry look at the first film - not surprised to see they both have
Spielberg on the production.<br /><br />The film is thrown together - e.g. strange duplication of stock footage
in seen setting outside the diner, and, is it just me, but there is
something up with the sound clarity making it hard to follow, the CGI
leaves me cold in jaded 2005, but whatever other reviewers say, the
plot does hang together and has some nice touches. Maybe a film sank by
the weight of expectation? If I was involved in its production I would
have been a bit taken aback by the savagery of the criticism.
