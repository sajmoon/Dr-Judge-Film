B- Will Smith, Johnny Knoxville, Tommy Lee Jones, Rosario Dawson, and
even Michael Jackson (ha-ha-ha&#x85;) were up to par here. It took a second
viewing for me to really appreciate the film, but it really is a
straight comedy spliced of course with sci-fi. The &#x22;worm guys&#x22; are
probably the best characters in the whole movie, being so outspoken and
well portrayed. The story is a brisk one, but it delivers nicely in my
opinion. Perhaps many felt the empty feeling when the movie was over
was that the story moves along way too quickly, and I suppose it
could&#x27;ve been longer, but it does just fine.<br /><br />The action sequences are generally well done and each has their own bit
of quirky comedy, which leads me to the alien designs which once again
will definitely aspire a second look or two. One can really get a tone
for the film by Danny Elfman&#x27;s score, considering there is no real
emotional strong point in the music; one can technically expect the
same from the movie. While the sequel may lack some of the scares and
better told mystery, it&#x27;s still a enjoyable laugh.
