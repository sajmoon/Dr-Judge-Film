The first Men in Black Movie which came out in 1997, was a fun, Thrill
ride of action, Comedy and FX, with great leads in Will Smith &amp; Tommy
Lee Jones.<br /><br />Fast Forward 5 years Later and we have the sequel - Men in Black 2,
which I was looking forward to seeing having enjoyed the first, Well I
gotta be honest I was hugely disappointed not only was this Short....
Way Short with Film &amp; Credits coming in at UNDER 90 minutes, The Story
was weak and by-the-numbers and Nobody&#39;s heart was in it - Smith &amp;
Jones were going through the motions and acted as If they couldn&#39;t be
bothered and were in it purely for contractual reasons, The SFX while
great after a while were tiresome and seemed to be overdone to a huge
amount to cover the inadequacies in the plot - The Comedy was forced
and where was Linda Fiorentino who took over Jones&#39; role at the End of
the first? She was nowhere to be seen &amp; and as far as I recall no
reason was given for her absence - although I know Fiorentino was a
notoriously difficult actress to work with and she hasn&#39;t made a motion
picture for many years, but a reference to her character would have
been nice. Co-Stars which included Rosario Dawson, Johnny Knoxville,
Lara Flynn Boyle &amp; Rip Torn, were abysmal and close to embarrassing.<br /><br />It was a huge hit of course - though not as big as it&#39;s predecessor,
but quite frankly it didn&#39;t deserve to be a hit, It&#39;s just another
example of Hollywood treating Cinema-goers as Mindless Idiots who&#39;ll
watch anything with oodles of Effects, regardless of the quality of the
script.<br /><br />From as far back as 2005 there&#39;s been talk of a second sequel,
Personally I think This shameless Cash-in Sequel Is quite enough thank
you very much<br /><br />**/*****
