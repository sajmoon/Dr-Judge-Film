Will someone tell the writer of this movie to give it an actual
plot?!!!
Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, are great actors..they can turn a bad movie
into a good one..but this one lacked so much depth in the script that even
after all the hard work put in by these two great actors it wasnt enough.<br /><br />Sequels like this gives hollywood the bad 'only want to make money' name it
has today.
