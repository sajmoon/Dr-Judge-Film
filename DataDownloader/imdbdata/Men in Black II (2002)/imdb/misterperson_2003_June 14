I didn't even like the first one that much, so I don't know why I even paid
money to see this movie, which starts off different, but when it gets to the
middle, you realize it's all the same.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones, an actor who, at a time, had a lot of movies coming out
that were actually good, is at the point in his career, just like de Niro
and Ford, can't really find a good role anymore. It's actually good he was
in it, otherwise this movie would have been unbearable (But it's very
close).<br /><br />The main problem with this movie is the fighting sequences are all from the
first one, which I never found exciting. What's the point of wasting $100
million to make a movie that has the same plot as the first? Obviously, so
at the end of the weekend, everyone can get a huge paycheck. For a letter
grade, I'd have to give it a D-.
