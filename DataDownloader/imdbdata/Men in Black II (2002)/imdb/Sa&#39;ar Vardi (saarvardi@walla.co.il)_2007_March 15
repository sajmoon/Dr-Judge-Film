On one of the coolest looking sequels ever, Will Smith and Tommy Lee
Jones find themselves back in action as secret agents J and K,
protecting the Earth from the scum of the Universe. Just like part 1,
the theme song (&quot;Black Suits Coming&quot;) makes you move your feet, the
effects are top notch (the miniature galaxy inside the locker, the
subway-eating worm, the post office workers etc.), and the general feel
just make you smile. Sure, its nothing too deep or too inventive as the
first one &#150; but it&#39;s a solid, entertaining sequel with magnificent
eye-candy nonetheless and a hell of a time at theaters (first) and on
DVD (later). &quot;Let me see you nod your heads (black suits coming)&quot;
