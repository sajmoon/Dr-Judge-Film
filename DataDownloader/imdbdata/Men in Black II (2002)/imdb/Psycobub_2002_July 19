The only good things about this movie (besides Will Smith and Tommy Lee
Jones' acting) were the dog, and a few of the special FX scenes. Other than
that it was mostly recycled material from the original, hastily put
together, below-average plot line, and a very unsatisfying ending. Looks
like the movie was made by a studio &quot;suit&quot; in order to make money, and not
a
real writer in order to make a good film. Save your money; rent the first
one again.
