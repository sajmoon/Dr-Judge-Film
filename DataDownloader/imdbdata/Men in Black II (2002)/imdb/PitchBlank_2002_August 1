Most reviewers argue that Men in Black II is dumb cash-in standard issue
sequel with no story, no script and with blatant product placement to
boot.<br /><br />They're right about the product placement and the cash-in part, but this
movie is certainly not dumb as such. MIIB goes nowhere near the rock
bottom
lowest common denominator level of the stereotypical Hollywood comedy that
does great in the US but the rest of the world hates it (Waterboy,
Caddyshack, Scary Movie to name but a few).<br /><br />The problem with MIIB is not that it's dumb, because it simply isn't. It's
not throwing Arnold-type one liners at you; it's not built on toilet humor
(if you want a 'rectal' Sci-fi comedy check out the Head &amp; Shoulders
commercial &quot;Evolution&quot;); it's not pulling _only_ cheap laughs out of the
audience. It's not an intellectual masterpiece, rest assured. But it's
street smart.<br /><br />The problem with MIIB is not the story. Yes, it's a complete blueprint of
MIB, like any other derivatory bad-guy-gets-it-at-the-end action comedy.
But
then again you really didn't expect the Marshmallow man to win in
Ghostbusters did you.<br /><br />The REAL problem with MIIB is a total lack of HEART, and consequently of
TIMING. Nobody cared about this movie. Nobody burned for this
movie.
This movie was nobody's baby. MIIB is like the fastest guitar solo in the
world played by a robot: Everything is in perfect pitch and therefore
utterly devoid of emotion. As a result, nothing works as intended. The
timing makes no sense at all. People in the theater aren't laughing - but
they're not rolling their eyes either, they just sit there completely
blank,
with a slight touch of confusion. They get the jokes alright, but they're
delivered in a context that never allows for a joke to be absorbed,
because
of what happened immediately before it, or what happens immediately after
it. It's as if the entire film is a patchwork of jokes randomly thrown in,
like there was an isolated staff of joke writers who just delivered funny
dialog, a separate team working on the storyline, and then it was all
boiled
down into some software that generated the script based on an algorithm
with
no bare bones timing parameters like &quot;punchline&quot; and &quot;cue&quot;.<br /><br />Take Sam Raimi's Spiderman - it's just as predictable and derivatory as
anything else in this category, but Raimi _loves_ Spiderman, and probably
sits up all night playing with his action figures, and his childish
fascination with Spidey makes all the difference, because we can all feel
it.<br /><br />I get a George Lucas vibe out of MIIB. It looks great but there's no
traces
of humanity anywhere. Oh wait, somebody must have liked Frank the dog,
because his timing was good for the lion's share of his screen time. And
surprise - people laughed.<br /><br />I'm not going to watch MIIB again. I didn't walk out of the theatre hating
it or feeling ripped off, I just walked out feeling absolutely nothing.
None
of the people I went with had anything to say, everyone just
shrugged.
