This is a reasonably entertaining film, although not anywhere near as good
as the original.  Smith and Jones do a good job reprising their roles;
it's
too bad they didn't have a better script to work with.  The best part of
this movie is the dog--if there's a &quot;Men in Black III&quot;, I hope he's in it.<br /><br />I might add that this movie doesn't deserve some of the harsh reviews it's
received.  No, it's not a terrific film, but it's fun to
watch.
Verdict: Okay movie, maybe see it.<br /><br />
