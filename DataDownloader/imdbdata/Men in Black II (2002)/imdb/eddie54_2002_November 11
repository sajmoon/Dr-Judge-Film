If Men in Black II was a toaster, I would return it as defective. It's Pat,
the movie had more laughs than this.  Will Smith's top priority was looking
cool.  Being funny was secondary.  Tommy Lee Jones just looked like a
constipated old man.  The script seemed like it was written by the concerted
efforts of your average elementary school class.  All in all, it maintains
Hollywood's latest commandment: Originality is a sin!<br /><br />Message to Will Smith and Barry Sonnefeld:  I hope you guys enjoyed the
money that you made from this film.  As far as I'm concerned, you took it
under false pretences.  Respect for you is futile.
