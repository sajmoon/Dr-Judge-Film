One day, I was on vacation some place and I noticed that this was on
television, I had seen the first film and really loved it and so I
decided to watch this one from the beginning, I can say that it was
very hysterical. This film is a movie that is very funny as the first
film, it is very hysterical, thrill filled, with a lot of action, and
overall, a movie that will cause you to split your sides! I also
noticed that Barry Sonnenfeld was returning to direct this movie and I
can say that he did a really good job with this film as well as he did
with the previous film! Though I really like the first movie better
than this one, I can really say that this is a movie that I really was
laughing at when I was watching it! If you really love Men in Black and
you loved the first film, then you will probably really enjoy this
movie and be laughing out loud at it like I did when I first saw this.
This movie is another movie that I can say that I thought was a very
funny movie that I got a lot of laughs out of.<br /><br />I have just stated this in the paragraph above but if you really
enjoyed the previous Men in Black movie and you would really like to
see this movie, then you should see it, because you will really get a
lot of laughs out of it! This movie is really a slap-happy time that
was really making me laugh and laugh! You should see this very
hysterical movie, you will be laughing your heart out, and your eyes
will water was you watch this really funny movie! Before I close my
review, I would like to say thanks to Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith, and to Mr.
Sonnenfeld for all being part of a movie that is really a funny movie
to watch and enjoy!<br /><br />Well watch this movie, and just let the laughs keep on coming in your
direction, because when you watch this movie, you will be laughing and
laughing yourself silly!<br /><br />10/10
