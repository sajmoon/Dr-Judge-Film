This movie was bad from start to finish.
Lots of creatures, but the same old story
and nothing particularly funny. The highlight
was a cameo by Michael Jackson (yes he was
the scariest looking creature in the film).
I kept waiting for something good, but it
just did not happen. Will Smith was boring,
as was Lara Flynn Boyle, and Tommy Lee Jones
simply could not rescue such a dismal effort.
