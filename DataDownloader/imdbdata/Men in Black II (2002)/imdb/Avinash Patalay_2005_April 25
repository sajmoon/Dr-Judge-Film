One of those movie which compels you to watch the sequel because you
have liked the first one. And come out of the cinema, feeling cheated.<br /><br />The plot is wafer-thin and predictable. The soul is absconding from the
word go. Even the star-cast lack conviction. The action, humour and CGI
which formed the integral part of the MIB seems force-fit in the
sequel.<br /><br />Wonder if Spielberg was purposefully omitted in the brain-storming
sessions of the sequel.<br /><br />Clearly evident that owing to the stupendous success of the MIB, the
studio decided to en-cash by a sequel MIB - II. <br /><br />Stay away if you don't wish to spoil the taste of the former.
