Who let *this* dog out?<br /><br />&quot;Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry, this could be a case
for
Mulder and Scully&quot;... er, well, no, not really. The Man-and-Woman in
Black
would be falling about at the inanity of it all. Just what is this film
about?
It's not entertainment, that's for sure. Seems like it's just a
simple-minded
exercising of the power of modern computer graphics. And cynical
money-making.
&quot;Men in Black did really well.&quot; &quot;Yeah, and I've got this great new
software.&quot;
&quot;Ok then, looks like we got ourselves another train full of
gravy!&quot;<br /><br />The first fifteen minutes give it away, really. There's barely an
original
thought on show; instead we get images and ideas ripped off from Lexx,
Buffy,
Mission: Impossible, The X-Files, Doctor Who, Buffy again, ... and those
were
the just ones I noticed - not being a great sci-fi or action movie buff,
who
knows what others I missed?<br /><br />The acting (if I dare call it that) seems to have been inspired by
watching
too many cardboard cut-outs standing outside small shops advertising
this
week's special offer. To call it two-dimensional would be an insult
to
Flatlanders. Will Smith coasts through apparently thinking &quot;Hey, you saw me
in
Men in Black and you liked what you saw; just try to remember the good
times
we had back then&quot;; Tommy Lee Jones seems to have decided that simply
looking
confused most of the time will do; Rosario Dawson pouts
beautifully but with her physiognomy that really isn't a struggle.
Various
hangers-on come on strong like cast-offs from Star Trek - hey guys,
just
because you're in a stupid costume and we can't see your face (or in
one
unfortunate case we can see your face twice) doesn't mean you can get
away
with simply lumbering from A to B and lunging wildly when you get there. Rip
Torn obviously said something
unpleasant to someone in the make-up department, for why else would he
be
half-submerged behind that ridiculous face-fungus? Finally (in the humanoid
department) Lara Flynn Boyle as the naughty alien
chasing its particular Holy Grail and blowing up/slicing in two/eating
anyone
in its way is neither nasty, cunning or funny enough.<br /><br />As for the non-humanoids... hey, a talking dog, with att-i-tuuuude,
now
*that's* a sure-fire winner. Hmmm, how can I put this? *Oh* *no* *it's*
*not!*
This one's not clever, it's not original, it's not funny. Especially when
it
serves absolutely no plot purpose whatsoever. The same goes for those
stupid
wormy things. Whatever happened to respect for the audience's
intelligence?<br /><br />Normally I rate films out of 10 but this one doesn't deserve the
extra
neuron-firing. Alas, if the viewing I went to is anything to go by, it's
going
to make more than enough money to lure the producers into making a
third
installment. May I plead with the aliens already living their undercover
lives
on our humble planet: please, take over Hollywood before it's too
late!
