This is a very good sequal to the blockbuster from '97.<br /><br />Possitive:
The movie starts 5 years later in time. It's also 5 years later in real
time. That makes it more realistic. everything has improved; the policy's,
the knowledge of Agent J and the new Mercedes. Agent J became the new
number
one agent of MIB. He took the place of K and made some differences in the
methods. More hillarious nuralizer-story and even MORE partners :) Frank
the
pug became a worse non-stop-talking-who-thinks-that-it-can-sing
dog.
The jokes become better and the action was better organized than in the
first MIB-movie.
Good performance: Johnny &quot;jackass&quot; Knoxville<br /><br />Negative:
Lara Flynn Boyle... She is a fine looking lady but she misses some
charisma,
everytime i saw her i thought of Famke Janssen. I know... Famke is From
the
Netherlands, but she has it all to made the bad women character more evil.
It's a shame that she had some domestic problems otherwise this movie was
(almost) perfect (there's no such thing as a perfect movie).
