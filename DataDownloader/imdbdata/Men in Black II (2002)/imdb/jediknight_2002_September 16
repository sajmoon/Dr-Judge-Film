I still don't understand why I didn't like the first one. It surely wasn't
bad, but.. I guess, in 97 I've just been expecting something more clever to
come, although now I don't see any reason why should it actually have
happened.<br /><br />Well, the things have changed and even the Star Wars are not the same. You
agree with me, don't You? Nothing's the same. So.. getting stuck with the
old stereotypes really won't make You feel Your ticket payed off. Pity, but
true. You don't expect movies to be made today the way they were made in
60s, likewise the movies of 70s or 80s.<br /><br />So.. my expectations really were not high for this one. Funny, but I liked
it. I guess, I just wasn't expecting anything more than they were ready to
give me. And so, I had some fun watching Will Smith, the Dog, some new
aliens and even (!) romance. What's even more funny, I guess I'll be waiting
for the 3rd one.<br /><br />So long.
