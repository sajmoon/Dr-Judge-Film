Oh wait, it is another stupid sequel.  I went to see the first MIB film
kicking and screaming.  Not thinking much of Will Smith, and seeing the
silly looking trailer left me with no expectations.  After seeing it I was
a
fan.  Will Smith was good, and Tommy Lee Jones was great.  Add to that some
awesome special effects and a solid plot (for a comedy) and it was a great
movie in my opinion.<br /><br />So when I heard MIB II was nearly here I was itching to see it.  Will Smith
came to Sydney about a month ago and fuelled that fire, with funny as hell
interviews on TV and radio.  My only negative thought was that they showed
too many funny jokes in the preview.  This turned out to be true.  If you
want to laugh at this film at all don't watch the trailers, as they are the
sum of all funny jokes in the film.  Other than the trailer jokes, we just
have Will Smith itching to say something funny throughout the film, but
being held back by a shocking script.<br /><br />Tommy Lee was funny again, but also struggled to get past the weak script.
I'm sure if there was no script and the two actors had just been asked to
ad
lib the whole movie they would have done a MUCH better job.<br /><br />Lara Flynn Boyle did nothing for me.  I'm not sure whether she was supposed
to seem evil/funny/sexy/scary but she never really achieved anything?<br /><br />To give an indication, the theatre I was in was half full and yet 99% of
the
time you could hear a pin drop after most supposed jokes.  It was eerily
quiet, like when you are in a huge movie theatre with one or two other
people.<br /><br />To finish, don't watch this film if you've seen all the trailers as that is
the highlight reel of the movie.  If you haven't seen these trailers there
might just be enough to get you through the whole movie.<br /><br />3/10
