When I say MIB2 is a &quot;trailer movie&quot;, I mean the whole thing was designed
purely to make a good trailer. It had a thin plot, the SFX weren't as ground
breaking as the first time round - but the worst part was, I'd seen all the
punchlines from the trailer.<br /><br />Whether I'd have liked the movie if I hadn't seen the trailer is debatable,
but having seen the trailer (and most people would have, they sure plugged
it a lot) the movie is reduced to farcical.<br /><br />Save your money.
