Nice, really nice. It has an origin mostly comic but has good special
effects. It was inevitable to see negative comments here, is the norm.
Cmq a good movie, the environments are good actors suited to the type
of film. He certainly part ironic, comic, the environments are very
well and the result can be considered as satisfactory. It is a shame
that here there are elements that bring more than 7 film ridiculous as
the army of darkness and films such as van helsing a miserable 5.
Shame! I disagree with the standards is happening here, I am not
convinced. In some cases there are good reviews, in other see that
there are some &#39;too many prejudices against certain films!
