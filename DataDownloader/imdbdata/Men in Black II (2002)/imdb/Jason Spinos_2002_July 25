Men In Black 2 is largely inferior to the original, relying on a quick
pace to keep the audience from noticing the lack of character
development and plot. There is a shocking dearth of action
scenes, and the audience never once doubts the safety of Jay and
Kay. But I can not say that this film is without merit. Will Smith and
Tommy Lee Jones are both solid in this film, and it keeps you
laughing much of the time. The film contains a video store scene
that is one of the funniest I've seen in quite a while. However, why
anyone would find the talking dog more than mildly amusing is
beyond me.
