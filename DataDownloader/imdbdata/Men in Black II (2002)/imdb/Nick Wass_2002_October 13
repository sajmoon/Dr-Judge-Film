What a load of old toss. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones looked bored and
given the thin plot and awful script I'm not surprised. This has none of the
charm of MIB I and is little more than a huge amount of computer generated
effects which seems to be Hollywood's only way of making a big film these
days.<br /><br />The most annoying part for me was that wretched talking/singing dog. Not
funny at all. <br /><br />I think we have all been &quot;had&quot; with this movie and should all ask for our
money back right now.
