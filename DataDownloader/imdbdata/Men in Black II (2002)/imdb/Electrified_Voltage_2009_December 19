The original &#x22;Men in Black&#x22; turned out to be a very successful
blockbuster, so it was no surprise when it spawned a sequel. It took
five years, but fans finally got to see &#x22;Men in Black II&#x22; in 2002.
However, like many other movie sequels, this one turned out to be a
disappointment to many fans of the original, and certainly didn&#x27;t do as
well. I first saw this sequel nearly four years ago, very early in
2006. I wasn&#x27;t that impressed, and could only remember little bits from
that viewing. After revisiting the original 1997 sci-fi action comedy
last month, which I still found impressive, I decided I would watch
this one again, which I did last night. I think my second viewing was a
lot like my first, meaning that it was a mixed blessing.<br /><br />Agent J is still working for the Men in Black five years later, while
Agent K has retreated to civilian life, with his memories from his
years as an MIB agent all gone. J has been unable to keep a consistent
partner for his work since K&#x27;s retirement, constantly dismissing his
partners from the agency due to their incompetence. The planet&#x27;s latest
extraterrestrial threat is the return of an evil shapeshifting
Kylothian named Serleena, an old foe of the MIB! She has come to Earth
searching for the powerful Light of Zartha, and has taken the form of a
lingerie model! The only one who can stop her is K, so J must bring
back the ex-agent (who now works at a post office and is known as Kevin
Brown), as the entire planet is depending on him! As J attempts to
restore K&#x27;s memory, Serleena takes over MIB headquarters and releases
the alien prisoners! <br /><br />The visuals in &#x22;Men in Black II&#x22; are just as good as those of its
predecessor, once again with all the sets, special effects, and
gadgetry. Also, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones still show their
charisma as the co-stars. Unfortunately, these positives are not enough
for this sequel to match the 1997 original. I laughed lightly at times,
so there&#x27;s some pretty good humour in the movie, but some parts are
just too juvenile. The alien with his scrotum on his chin instead of
his groin is a good example of this. The part with the little world
inside a locker is also supposed to be funny, but it&#x27;s not (or at least
not usually), and it really seems misplaced in this flick. So, the
humour definitely isn&#x27;t as good here as it is in the original &#x22;Men in
Black&#x22;, and doesn&#x27;t really work for the most part. There&#x27;s suspense in
this film, but not as much as there is in its predecessor, though this
probably isn&#x27;t as big a problem as the lack of laughs. The writers
probably could have focused a bit more and maybe could have come up
with more surprises.<br /><br />Because of this movie&#x27;s redeeming qualities, I would say it&#x27;s slightly
above average, but ONLY slightly. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as bad as some
&#x22;MIB&#x22; fans think it is, but can understand why it&#x27;s significantly less
popular than the 1997 summer blockbuster. Even if most sequels are
inferior to their predecessors, and this one couldn&#x27;t have been an
exception, it still could have been better than it turned out to be.
(Mind you, it also could have turned out far worse.) If you&#x27;ve enjoyed
1997&#x27;s &#x22;Men in Black&#x22;, you could find some entertainment value in this
sequel, but I don&#x27;t suggest you expect anything too breathtaking. It&#x27;s
been seven years since the release of &#x22;Men in Black II&#x22;, but it appears
a third installment is coming. Maybe they will work out some of the
problems featured in this second installment, but I wouldn&#x27;t get my
hopes up.
