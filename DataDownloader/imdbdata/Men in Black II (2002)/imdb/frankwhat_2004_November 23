If you've seen one Will Smith movie you've basically seen them all.
With the exception of &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; he plays a character
with the exact same attitude in each one. The only film he did that I
ever deemed worthy enough to buy was &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;. Other than
that it's just the same crap different day. It was a bad idea for me to
rent this as I didn't really like the first one and even though it's
been awhile I still remember it to have been much better than this.
Actually they used a lot of ideas over again and I can't figure out why
they felt the strong urgency to make an uncalled for sequel. Tommy Lee
Jones did the best acting out of everyone but he was only in it for the
last half and even he wasn't anything special. I will say however that
Lara Flynn Boyle had a knockout body in this! She was always considered
hot but breast augmentation really worked well for her. I hear now she
became anorexic though and that's a shame because she should've stuck
to what she did here. It'd be unwise to critique Johnny Knoxville's
performance since I don't think he's really considered an actor. The
only rendition he ever did that was good enough to be thought of as
acceptable was in &quot;Walking Tall&quot;. Finally Rip Torn was underused as
well. Therefore I can't recommend this except to fans of the original
that are dying for more.<br /><br />Final Shuttle:<br /><br />Movies: Would've been a waste of money.<br /><br />DVD Purchase: I'm not that crazy yet.<br /><br />Rental: I didn't think it was worth it!
