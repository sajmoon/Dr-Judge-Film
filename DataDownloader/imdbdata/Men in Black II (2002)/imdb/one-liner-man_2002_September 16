Well balanced, never boring, with a lot of gems (like the exhilarating
creatures in the locker). If you are going to see this movie in believing
it's a masterpiece, of course you will be disappointed; instead, if you
are
going to see it by knowing what it is (just a funny, self-joking movie)
you
will enjoy.<br /><br />7/10
