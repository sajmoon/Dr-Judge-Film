I can honestly say that this movie (in it's entirety) is still the one
movie
that people will always refer to as the all-time party movie, even after a
decade.  Ten years ago Richard Linklater made a movie that alot of people
and critics said would die a nasty death, but man were they wrong.  My
little brother is in high school now, and just the other day came to me
and
said I should watch the best movie of all time,DAZED AND CONFUSED...  I
must
admit I WAS NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.  It was like I expected him to say Dazed
And Confused...  But it just goes to show that great actors and a catchy
story make great and everlasting films.  To think that such actors as
Jason
London, Rory Cochrane, Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich,
Shawn Andrews, Joey Lauren Adams and Cole Hauser to name just a few (ya
maybe my favorites oh well lol) is astonishing.  I would honestly and
truthfull recommend this, and I have, to anyone and everyone.  To another
10
years and a whole new generation........CHEERS MR. LINKLATER....and thank
you..........
