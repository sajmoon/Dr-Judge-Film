I didn't grow up during 1976, but I can believe the teen antics in this
film. They make me wish I had grown up during '76. But I had my good
times too in high school and the qualities this film presents are true
of all teenagers, regardless of when they were born.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused chronicles the lives of teenagers in the seventies,
a portrayal that seems to suggest a grander and more carefree way of
life. And appropriately we see young undiscovered kids who would go on
to become super stars (e.g.: Jason London, Ben Affleck, Matthew
McConaughey). The setting for the movie is atypical -school. Sex,
drugs, and rock-and-roll are pretty much the themes of the time. Guess
not too much has changed since then. And crazy stunts like paddle
whipping freshman, throwing keg parties, vandalizing property, illegal
drinking, etc. add not only humor but also a nostalgic quality of the
crazy things we all did as kids. The director's ability to show things
as they might of really happened gives the viewer sort of an empathetic
flashback and reflection on a time gone by. It gives us an episode from
the golden years, a time of recklessness and foolishness, and whose
value we would never realize until several years later, when we would
turn into grown ups. For this reason, and the wonderful comedy &quot;Dazed
and Confused&quot; carries with it in its budding stars, I highly recommend
watching (if not purchasing) this one! 9/10
