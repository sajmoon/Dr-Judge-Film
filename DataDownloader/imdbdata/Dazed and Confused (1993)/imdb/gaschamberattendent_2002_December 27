This movie, like a considerable portion of Richard Linklater's other movies,
has almost no plot.  We see a bunch of teenagers running around on the last
day of school in 1974 in I believe Austin, Texas.  They skip class, beat
each other up, and smoke a very large amount of pot.  This movie functions
on several levels.   It is a nostalgia piece, a lowbrow comedy, and a
meditation of existence.  Similar to Larry Clark's Kids, the teenagers in
this movie do things which would make parents shudder.  Unlike Kids, the
teenagers ultimately have to surrender to their parents. <br /><br />      On the highest level, these teenagers are a metaphor for the human
race.  They go to school and party and prepare for a future that seems as
though it will never come.  Anything they do doesn't seem to have
consequences.  They, like every teenager ever, seem to know everything.  
Watching this movie you become absorbed and feel as though you are actually
in it.  This movie takes you on a journey through a june night in the south.
 You can't really say too much about this movie.
