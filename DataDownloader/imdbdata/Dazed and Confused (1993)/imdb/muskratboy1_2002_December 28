This is really a great movie, richard linklater's best.  It's funny,
touching, and performances are universally good.  It's hard to
describe, but there really is a magic to this movie... it captures the
time and place, and touches on some universal themes and
experiences.<br /><br />jason london is great in the lead role,  ben affleck shows early
promise as the main asshole, and mathew maconoughy is the
freaking COOLEST as the creepy older burnout.  awesome
performances from some big stars early on in their careers, and
even the unknowns really come through.<br /><br />yes, if you have a real problem with watching people in movies
drink and smoke pot, then this movie probably isn't for you.<br /><br />looking at this film that narrowly would truly be a shame, because
it has a hell of lot more going on that just that.
