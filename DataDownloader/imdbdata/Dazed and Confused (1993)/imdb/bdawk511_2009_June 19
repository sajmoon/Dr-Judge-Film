Dazed and Confused is one of the greatest Cult classics ever. Everyone
has there favorite character and everyone knows some great lines from
the movie.<br /><br />The movie takes place on the last day of school where the high school
SR&#x27;s haze and paddle the now high school Freshman. No character takes
the hazing as seriously as O&#x27;Bannion (Ben Affleck). It also revolves
around drug use and a late night kegger. Two of my favorite characters
in the movie are resident cool guy, Wooderson (Matthew McConaughey),
and stoner Slater (Rory Cochrane.) A number of reasons can be given as
to why this is such a great movie but I&#x27;ll give 1. The movie feels
remarkably real and authentic. A lot of the kids in this movie are just
kids found and asked if they would play in this movie. They are all
very good and there inexperience makes the movie feel even more real.
There is no real point to the movie which I suppose is the point of the
movie. It&#x27;s a movie where if you like it you&#x27;ll watch over and over and
over and over again (I think I&#x27;ve seen it 20 times since last year.)
