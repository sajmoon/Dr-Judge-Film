Having grown up just north of Buffalo N.Y.{Tonawanda} in the 70s I can
say this movie captures the mood and feel of that era in that area like
no movie I ever saw{ based in Texas I know} ,I find myself looking for
myself in the movie thats how real some of the shots are,the drug use
is almost understated and the way the girls and guys react to each
other is like a trip back in time .My little town had all the
characters that you see in the film from O&#39;bannon to slater and
everyone in between,do yourself a favor rent this film smoke your
favorite type of tobacco and grab a cold one ,after that meet me at the
moon tower,and we&#39;ll party like its 1976.
