This movie left me dazed and confused. Set in the 1970s, this film
discovers teenage rebellion and the initiation of children about ready
to become a part of high school. This film is a good look at the
mentality of teenagers and some psychological issues, but it does not
leave room for much else.<br /><br />The film is just like a typical 'day in the life' with the audience
participating and looking into that little piece of life. It details
initiations of some young girls into a seniority club, some young men
who plan to go have a party, and a big drinking party. We also have the
bullies and some of the rebels smashing mailboxes and drag racing. This
film really does not portray youth in a very good light. Although I
would have been just starting High School when the film was released, I
didn't see it until a few months ago. It really did remind me of some
of the things that took place in school.<br /><br />Okay, some of the film is funny - particularly the guy who is always
stoned. However, a lot of the film was 'dazed and confused' in terms of
the conventional storyline.
