Now, I was born the year this film came out, so I never personally
experienced the seventies. Man I would kill to have been 16 then
instead of now. This movie is fabulous. Every single actor and actress
does a great job. My favorite performances were Matthew McConaughey as
the Peter Pan-ish Wooderson, Jason London as the cool but really nice
Pink, Shawn Andrews as the mellow Pickford, and, best of all, Rory
Cochrane as the stoner hippie Slater (one of my favorite film
characters of all time, he steals every scene). This movie was so funny
and also extremely realistic. I am quite nostalgic for the seventies,
even though I was not there. I loved the fashions in the film, and also
the freedom that the kids enjoyed, which my generation simply does not
have. If I had a time machine, this is the period I would go back to
and want to live in. Last of all, this is one of the greatest movie
soundtracks of all time. And the funniest part is I am going to an
Aerosmith/ ZZ Top concert in two weeks. See this movie! you won&#x27;t be
disappointed!
