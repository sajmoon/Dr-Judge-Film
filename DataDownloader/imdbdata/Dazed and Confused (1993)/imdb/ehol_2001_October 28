The details are all dead-on--the costumes are perfect, the hair is great,
and all in all, the 90s kids in the cast give excellent portrayals of 70s
kids.  <br /><br />The best thing about the movie, though, is its stream-of-consciousness
pacing.  The ostensible plot about a hazing ritual provides enough of an
undercurrent to keep things moving, but on the surface, it's slow enough to
feel almost like real time.  It doesn't wallow enough to be genuine
nostalgia--unlike the narrator in &quot;Stand By Me,&quot; director Linklater doesn't
need to tell us that this was the best time in his life or ours or that
nothing like it will ever happen again, and maybe it's because Linklater
knows that any time in life has its own problems.  All he does is take you
back and let you feel what it was like.
