If you went to high school in the 70&#39;s you will love this movie. The
music and the type of characters that are in this movie brings back a
lot of memories. My kids ask me if it was really like that back then
{back then, you&#39;d think it was in the stone age according to them!}and
I tell them it was exactally like that. When I had gone to high school
I had friends just like those that were in this movie and I also had
been in many of the same situations that had happened in this movie.
The first time I saw this movie I couldn&#39;t believe how right on it was
for those of us who are between the age of 42 to 52. I predict this
will become a cult hit, almost like that of &quot;American Graffitti&quot;. Good
music, interesting characters, accurate depiction of the time period,
overall a really great flick.
