I like this movie anyway but the fact that it was filmed in Austin,
Texas where I live makes it that much better. Even more so is the fact
that it was actually filmed at my middle school, Bedicheck Middle
School in South Austin just a few miles from my house. I was in the 7th
grade at the time and I remember the school lockers and doors getting a
fresh coat of paint for the movie as well as the movie crew setting up
some for the shoot during the summer. The parking lot scenes in the
movie is where I use to catch the bus! The movie is such a great escape
from today, a good study of the 70s for teens in America and I always
enjoy it since it froze time for me at the school that I went to back
in 1993...
