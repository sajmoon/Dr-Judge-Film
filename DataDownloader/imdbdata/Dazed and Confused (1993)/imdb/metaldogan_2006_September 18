i loved this movie so much because it shows what the 70s were like and
i wish i was born then because parties were way cooler and the music
was awesome.i also liked the fact that they had a lot of actors just
taking off in there career. my favorite character would have to be
slater-san because he had the heavy stoner style which was different
then than it is now. i like the jocks in that movie as well there not
ego maniacs like pink he fought the man, man. my dad grew up in the 70s
and he said when i was watching the movie he said there was my Friday
night right there which was pretty cool. the music again what they
picked was very accurate with the times so it all fell into place for a
1993 movie. this movie is one of my favorites and always will be.
