Dazed and Confused is a lot like the time in which it takes place. The
film doesn't have much of note to say, but you get the sense that it
has a good time just being there. By 1976, Vietnam was in the rear-view
mirror, as were much of the struggles of the previous decades. It was
almost like people were sick and tired of caring about things and just
wanted to get wasted. Notice how nobody seemed to care when their
teacher was trying to tell them about the 1968 Democratic Convention or
our &quot;aristocratic&quot; forefathers. There is a certain innocence about the
period that our up-tight and violent world of today could use right
now.<br /><br />Our film shows us the trials and tribulations of kids just looking to
get high, drunk, or just save their butts from being paddled on the
last day of school. Not much of note happens in this film. We just see
kids doing what kids are still doing. They are all just out to have a
good time. There are plenty of familiar faces in this cast, but nobody
really outshines anyone else. The film is paced in a manner that
doesn't let us get to know too much about the characters. We spend a
minute or two with one group of friends, then we see what another group
is up to. The most memorable scenes in the film are more painful than
funny. We see next year's freshman class (girls and guys) get pummeled
by the seniors. We see the destruction of property. We see a fight or
two break out. Plenty of beer and pot are consumed by all. And there
really isn't much else to it.<br /><br />Linklater films the action from a completely neutral vantage point.
There is nothing at all pretentious or preachy about any of the subject
matter. We see some cool cars, tight jeans, long hair, and just about
anything you would associate with this time frame. The film lacks the
humor of Porky's or The Hollywood Knights. It also lacks the tragic
desperation of The Last Picture Show. That said, this film is still
worth taking a look at. Especially if you were in high school at the
time. I was just a toddler in 1976, but I could still relate to these
characters, and their need to party.<br /><br />7 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.
