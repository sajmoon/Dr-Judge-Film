I got this on DVD after reading many great reviews. I watched the first
15 minutes... nothing... OK, maybe it&#x27;s a slow starter... then the next
15 minutes... still nothing, then the next 15 and so on until it was
over. The 70s America seemed to be the best place that a teen could
grow up in with the great sexual liberties and widespread drug usage
and all. However this movie portrays teenagers of the period as
incerdibly dull, the most &#x22;outrageous&#x22; thing they did throughout the
movie was smash some mailboxes with a trashcan and smoke some pot. And
that&#x27;s it!! Although a huge part of the American culture at the time,
LSD is only mentioned but no one even came close to doing it in the
movie, and psychedelia in general is missing (a part from some clothes
here and there). I can only hope that everyday teens from the period
had more fun that this...
