1998_August 11 

A groups of seniors, accompanied by miscellaneous characters, explores the
 last day of school in 1976.  Everyone knew the sentimental football player,
 the stoner/bong mechanic, the popular girls baring midriffs and hazing the
 new freshman, and the girls who had meaningful conversations about Gilligan's
 Island.  Fun, and with some great music, its a fun flick to watch with
 friends.
