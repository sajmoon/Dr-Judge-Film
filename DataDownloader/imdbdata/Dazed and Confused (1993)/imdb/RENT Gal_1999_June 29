There are two aspects of Dazed that make it a phenomenal film experience:
1)
It's just a great film, with great direction, dialogue, and acting.  2) It
has become The Outsiders of this generation.  Screw the Kevin Bacon game,
play the Dazed and Confused game!<br /><br />I will address the latter first, because that's the kind of crazy gal I
am.<br /><br />Let's start at the top:<br /><br />Jason London (Pink), half of the London twin duo.<br /><br />Joey Lauren Adams (Simone): of Chasing Amy, Michael, Second Noah, and of
late, Big Daddy fame.<br /><br />Rory Cochrane (Slater): Empire Records' gambling beatnick.<br /><br />Sasha Jenson (Dawson): hasn't done much lately, but he was in Buffy (the
movie).<br /><br />Ben Affleck (O'Bannion): megasuperstar!!  (also an appearance in
Buffy)<br /><br />Cole Hauser (Benny): Good Will Hunting's other drunk.<br /><br />Michelle Burke (Jodi): Coneheads.<br /><br />Adam Goldberg (Mike): Chandler's weird roomate, and one of the eight in
Saving Private Ryan.<br /><br />Deena Martin (Shavonne): the lovely, if fast, Vegas waitress in Swingers.<br /><br />Christine Harnos (Kaye): the ex-Mrs. Mark Greene on ER.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughy (Wooderson): another superstar.<br /><br />and my personal fave::::Anthony Rapp (Tony): skyrocketed to fame as Mark
Cohen in the Broadway smash, RENT!! Just finished the title role in You're
a
Good Man, Charlie Brown, also on Broadway.<br /><br />Okay, now that I've got that out of the way, I can actually talk about the
film.   There is so much that is so phenomenal about this film, that I
don't
know where to begin. The accuracy in the portrayal of high school life is
probably accurate for high school in the seventies, but in a modern
context,
it is more like college.  Initiation, humiliation, random hookups, all
night
beer benders, WAAAAAAY too much weed everywhere...sounds like college to
me!!<br /><br />Something else that many people miss is that this portrayal of high school
life is sooooo Texas that it's scary.  The way people talk.  The way
people
live for beer.  The way people are totally in love with their cars and all
of their &quot;f*****g muscle.&quot;  The fact that driving to Houston to buy
concert
tickets isn't an entirely outlandish idea.<br /><br />The so obscenely high school parts are beautifully done.  The
eighth-graders
(AKA freshmen) playing paper football on the last day of school made me
giggle, because this film was released not long after I got out of junior
high.  I loved how just hanging out at the Emporium LOOKED so cool, but to
the people there, life was boring.  (this device was used later in
Swingers.
At every kickin bar, the ubiquitous phrase of &quot;this place is dead anyway'
resonates.)<br /><br />Speaking of the Emporium, we come to my favorite scene: the entrance of
Mitch, Pink, and Wooderson into the Emporium.  Watch this scene carefully,
and for the lucky ones, you will feel a kinship to the characters.  As
they're driving up in W's chickmobile, Melba's Toast, Bob Dylan's
&quot;Hurricane&quot; begins.  The doors burst open into the hangout, and suddenly
everything is in slo-mo.  Wooderson's gestures, Pink's aknowledgements,
Mitch's cool uneasiness, all make us realize that they OWN the place.
This
is their Cheers, this is their Dresden.  Everybody knows them, or at least
who they are.  They are at home.  The shot ends abruptly with Pickford's
placing of a football on the table, in another delicious shot.  This is
some
of the best directing, storytelling through pictures, that I have ever
seen.<br /><br />Needless to say, I have seen this film WAY too many times (61 at press
time).  In fact, I did this entire review from memory at work in about 15
minutes!!<br /><br />See this film.  You will laugh, you won't cry, maybe you'll
yawp!!
