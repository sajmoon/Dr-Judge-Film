2003_February 16 

It's hard to believe that this movie came out ten years ago, when I myself
was a senior in high school.  I can't say that this film brings back any
happy memories of high school, mainly because I hated my high school and
the
small Nebraska town I grew up in.  I mention this because Dazed and
Confused
is enjoyable even if your own high school experience differed from the one
presented here.  (My own personality resembled that of Adam Goldberg's
character, so you can see what I mean.)<br /><br />Richard Linklater seems to specialize in making films that weave several
stories into one tapestry of life.  The film isn't so much about one or
two
characters as it is about a place and time.  In fact, his forays into
films
with more straight-forward plots have been less successful.  The Newton
Boys
and Before Sunrise lack the vitality of Waking Life, Slacker, and
especially
Dazed and Confused.  I am usually a sucker for ensemble films, especially
those of Robert Altman, so my comments here should be taken with a grain
of
salt by those who haven't seen the movie.  In fact, this is one of the few
ensemble-type films (along with Boogie Nights) that can really come close
to
Altman classics like Gosford Park, Short Cuts, Nashville, and
M*A*S*H*.<br /><br />Some scenes have an amazing realism about them that one rarely sees on the
screen.  There's more than one scene of girls and boys talking to each
other
awkwardly in ways that counteract the bland romantic platitudes one sees
in
mainstream films.  Other scenes perfectly capture the laconic nature of
those hours on a Friday spent after work or school and before the big
party
begins.<br /><br />The best part of the film, though, is its characters.  The film isn't long
enough to completely flesh them all out, but each has a defining
characteristic that sticks with you, whether it be the stoner Slater or
the
quarterback Randall &quot;Pink&quot; Floyd.<br /><br />My only problems would be with some of the acting, as Wiley Wiggins shows
himself to be an amateur in some of the ways he tries to communicate his
dislike of O'Bannion.  Of course, Ben Affleck (younger and with more
weight)
has the same annoying vocal ticks in this movie as he does in his later
ones
