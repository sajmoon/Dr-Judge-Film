Great music throughout the whole movie. Long before the age of computers,
you had to drive to major cities and purchase tickets. The writers should
have been more accurate and had them purchase Aerosmith tickets to see them
at the Texas Jam. Ben Affleck &amp; Matthew McConaughey were great in this
movie. Matthew McConaughey, had some classic lines that still apply in today
times. I am tired in of reading reviews, where is the plot, climax. When you
are teenager enjoying the last day of school and summer. You have no plot,
wake up hang out and complain because you are bored...<br /><br /> Stay Hard!
