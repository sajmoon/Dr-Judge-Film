This is actually a dumb movie, but I absolutely love it. I graduated
from high school in June 1976 and can totally relate to this movie from
beginning to end. The music is just what we listened to in my senior
year; brings it all back. The &quot;stoners&quot; and how they interact with each
other - dead on. The &quot;cliques&quot; between grade levels, and also between
the cool kids and the not-so-cool kids, also just perfect. And the
parties -- well, what can I say? Pass the word around and &quot;come one,
come all!&quot; It&#39;s all just how it was. Looking back on it now from my
perspective as a &quot;forty-ish&quot; adult (and not to mention a mom), I can
see how ridiculous it all was. But myself and all my friends from that
era turned out okay. Ah, the good old days ... Would love to visit
again, just once - but only for a little while. :)
