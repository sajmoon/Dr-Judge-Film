1999_February 4 

Yes, this is a fun and entertaining film, but it's a long ways short of
'hilarious' or most other superlatives.
It does have a fairly impressive 'Before they were Stars' line-up and the
cast all do pretty good jobs. The dialogue is clever and the age recreated
pretty well (although I was only 6 at the time the movie is set, I don't
think school was ever much like this outside of the USA).
Yes, this film is worth a watch, but the current rating and comments are WAY
over the top. My vote 7/10
