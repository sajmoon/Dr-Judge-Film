To Author: jscott7432 from United States a teenager who said that &#x22;The
70&#x27;s just seemed like they were amazing to live in like how so many
kids were cool with smoking pot, cigarettes, drinking, etc. today that
is not the case&#x22;.<br /><br />I grew up then and the movie is just a magnifying glass on a cut in
time. In fact many that lived it have overemphasized it. The pot
smokers, known as pot heads at my school, usually failed out of
classes, school etc. They were considered low life&#x27;s and failures. We
did have a smoking court. Big deal. Those same students today, who I
know are battling lung cancer due to the strength of cigarettes back
then. Drinking was around, beer mostly, but not the way they show it.
Probably less than there is today. Mostly after football games, etc.<br /><br />And sadly so were DUI deaths and injuries. A HS friend of mine was
permanently scarred when her head went through the windshield of the
car when her then drunk boyfriend hit a tree. <br /><br />Remember there were no airbags back then. No cell phones so emergency
help took longer to get there. Others died in what today would be a
minor accident. <br /><br />It was not cool. <br /><br />Never envy a previous generation. There was good and bad just like
today. It was right after the end of the Vietnam era so many of my
friends had older brothers or uncles who who never came back. <br /><br />Getting grounded stunk. No TV and there were no video games, cell
phones,Internet or anything else to entertain you so you read a book or
hung out with the parents while they watch TV and there were only like
5 channels (ABC, NBC, CBS and a few on UHF) the upside? No school
police, no guns in school, everyone actually went to college (except
the potheads).
