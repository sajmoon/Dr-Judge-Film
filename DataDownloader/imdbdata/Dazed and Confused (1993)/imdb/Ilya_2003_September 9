I'm going to be fairly straight forward about this. this is a
good
movie. it is the kind of movie you sit down with a bunch of good friends
with and just watch. no thinking, no interpreting, just lots of lauphs
and a
overall good time.
the charictors each had something interesting, somthing unique,
not
like in other movies where you have a group of people intereacting but
there
all the same, a great movie starts with great charictors, once you have
that
you can incorparate any day of there life an it will be AT LEAST
entertaining if not more, thats how i describe this movie. no more needs
to
be said.
