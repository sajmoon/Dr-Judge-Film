I could not believe what a boring and overall lame movie this is! The
other thing that amazes me is the movie is called a comedy!! I have
seen funnier films that were located in the drama or action sections of
the video store! Heck...I have seen funnier television commercials!! If
there were a zero on this site's rating system, I would have ranked
Dazed and Confused that. I thank God I didn't pay more than a couple
dollars to see this movie, because I would have asked for my money
back! As a matter of fact, I think I just might do that when I return
the movie tomorrow!! We rented this movie on a recommendation from a
friend - I will most definitely not listen to him again - what a waste
of 90 minutes!
