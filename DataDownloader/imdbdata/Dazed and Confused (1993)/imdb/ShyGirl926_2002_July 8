I was four when this movie was supposed to have taken place.  Perhaps if I
had grown up during that time, I would have gotten it.  As it was, I found
this movie pretty boring.  Not bad, just boring.  I did think Matthew
McConaughey's way-too-old-to-be-hanging-with-high-school-kids guy was
hilarious.  He's about the only thing in this movie I could identify my
high
school years with.
