I saw this movie in an out of the way theater in Seattle when it came
out in '93. From the opening shot, I was hooked on the cars, music and
feeling like I have been there. In '76, I was 3, but my older brother
was 15 and my first memories of him were actually not far from these
kinds of scenes. He wasn't an outgoing kind of guy, and never, that I
know of, smoked weed, but the whole feeling makes me think of him to
this day. Ironically, he passed away two years after this movie came
out. His favorite song back then was Beth by Kiss. He was the reason I
list Kiss as one of my top bands ever. I can imagine his life as being
like this when he was not in front of the parents. This movie
encompasses all of the seventies that I remember and brings it to life
so that others can experience the nutty things kids did then. Much more
simple than today's drama queens and computer-driven antics. The place
to be was out of the house at the drive-ins and cruising, not locked in
a basement with your buddies trying to beat the latest video game.
