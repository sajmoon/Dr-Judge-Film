2006_February 12 
Reading some of the comments here, you would think that this film
painted an idyllic picture about the transition from childhood to
adulthood, as represented by the final days of junior high/high school.<br /><br />Whilst the film does paint a picture of teens frantically trying to
have a good time at any expense, the film seems more about bullying,
both physical and psychological, and about the sad depths that American
teens will go to conform.<br /><br />Supercially, this appears to be a standard teen movie, but I suspect
that what at first appears to be a deliberately blas&eacute; approach to
ritual beatings, is actually a quite subtle way of drawing attention to
the &quot;lives of quiet desperation&quot; endured by many of the characters.<br /><br />The director is either a lot smarter or a lot less pleasant than you
can tell at first glance. If he really thinks that the battering of
freshman boys is funny, then he's a real a**hole. I give a low score
because even if the director was making a social commentary, the film
was moderately unpleasant to watch, from a European's point of view.<br /><br />There are some here who doubtless empathise with the jocks and the
party lifestyle, but then they were probably the same people who, in
their school years, made life miserable for those around them.<br /><br />I don't know if this unpleasant movie really does depict American teen
life, then or now, but if it does, it certainly explains a lot...
