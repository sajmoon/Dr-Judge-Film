1999_May 18 

This film is one of the all time classic movies although somewhat unknown
to a vast amount of people. Dazed and Confused really brings to life the
experience of 1976 high school with all the music, all the cars, all the
beer and ultimately all the grass.
This is a film which I would recommend to anyone looking for a cool easy
to
watch movie, it is a film once watched you are certain to want to see
again
and again.
