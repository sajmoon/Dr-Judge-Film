Dazed and Confused is a movie set in Austin, Tx in 1976,showing some of
the activities of the teen world from that era. Having graduated in
1976, I really enjoyed this movie a lot and thought the producers
really captured the trends and music from that year. Another thing that
I thought was interesting was the fact that the movie was set in
Austin, Tx in 1976, the same year, and town that one of the stars of
the movie (Wiley Wiggins)was born. The only part of the movie that I
didn&#x27;t agree with was Ben Affleck&#x27;s part of carrying around that dumb
paddle,I really don&#x27;t remember that happening back then. The movie
never stalled and for those of us from that time you were able to
relate to almost all of the characters in the film. Summing this movie
up, it was a nice trip down memory lane, and one that I would recommend
to my friends for a good time and a look back at a time when the only
problem teenagers had was finding a place to have a party.
