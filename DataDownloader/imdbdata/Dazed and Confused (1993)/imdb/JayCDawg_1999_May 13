1999_May 13 

Pure cinematic genius! Though much of the focus on this film is on its
lack
of a discernible plot and the glorification of drugs and underage
drinking,
the beauty of the film lies in the way it doesn't focus.  It plays like
life, where there is not always a story going on.  Keep in mind, the movie
takes place over
the course of a single day, so it could be asking a bit much to expect
much
in the way of an involved plot (in fact, a heavy plot would likely have
diminished Linklater's effort at capturing a moment).  For many people,
this
is life, these are people I know, people I hang with (though the 90's
version of them).<br /><br />Never boring and frequently funny, this film never ceases to entertain me.
It never tries to be something it cannot be.  With the fantastic casting
and
acting, and nearly impeccable direction, I give it an 11 out of
10!
