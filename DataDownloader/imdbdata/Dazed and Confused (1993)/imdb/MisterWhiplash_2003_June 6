Dazed and Confused was one of those movies I saw years ago in bits and
pieces on TV. At the time I was in my younger teens, and my first
thoughts were &quot;geez, these seniors are really cruel dudes&quot; and I turned
it off and watched something else. But recently I watched it again,
only this time it was put on in the beginning stages of a party at a
friends, where essentially there was the same mood as in the film which
made it more enjoyable (this, and that my friends had a drinking game
that whenever Affleck of McConaughey came up on the screen someone had
to chug a beer, but that&#39;s obviously besides the point). But while
watching it again I realized that what Linklater did was something like
Cheech and Chong did with their films or Kevin Smith did with Mallrats,
and so on... but then given that cool ensemble atmosphere of an Altman
pic. His film is for people just like in the movie, those who are going
through the rites and passages of adolescence, and that can either make
people feel pity for the characters, or humor. <br /><br />Bottom line, Dazed and Confused does the one day, one night time
capsule bit to as far as it can go, and it&#39;s a very entertaining like
that- that, plus a fantastic set of 70&#39;s songs...speaking of which, no
one should complain that the title track from Zep isn&#39;t on the
soundtrack since they nearly never give license for their songs to be
in movies (the only exceptions I can think of are Small Soldiers which
had Communication Breakdown, and Almost Famous which had a few songs,
but was only because of Zep&#39;s friendship with Crowe)...and this all
being said, it becomes a little more compulsively watchable on repeat
viewings; perhaps making it Linklater&#39;s most accessible film.
