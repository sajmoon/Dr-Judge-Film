Linklater may do a good job of recreating the look, feel, atmosphere
and overall attitude of suburban teen life in 1976. At times I felt I
was reliving that era. I was Born in 1968 which would have made me 8
years old for this time frame. Having an older brother and sister and
witnessing there early teenage years I could recall some nuances in D&#x26;C
that seemed like Deja Vu. Many comments on this board refer to how
accurate Director Linklater is in showing what high school people were
like in the 70&#x27;s. But he doesn&#x27;t have much material to work with other
than Muscle cars, long hair, bell-bottoms and &#x22;groovy&#x22; music. So I
can&#x27;t say that the effort on production value was elaborate or
extensive.<br /><br />If you are looking for involving drama and some real laughs you will
not find it here. What we see is basically a near documentary.
Linklater has given us a picture, but he hasn&#x27;t given us a movie.
Linklater doesn&#x27;t spend much more than a couple of minutes on one scene
before he pans to another scene of a group of teenagers, etc. It&#x27;s that
kind of movie. The purpose here is to paint a cinematic scrapbook, a
timepiece with minor events and inane escapades of high school kids
looking for a thrill. Some of the dialogue and characters were funny
and a couple even reminded me of some people I knew in my youth. The
most interesting character, Slider, played very well by Rory Cochrane
captures the spirit and personality very well of a teenage stoner. We
initially see him as a cool and hip pot-head with some witty remarks
exhibiting a crafty and sly demeanor. But we later discover that he is
rather insecure and more of a tag-along to his friends.<br /><br />Besides some of the actors who showcase like McConaghey, Affleck, and
Jovovich, some of them appear like amateurs and newcomers to acting.
Mainly the younger kids and the parents I am referring to.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused serves its purpose in that it wants to be like a
walk down Memory lane. Some of the actors capture teenage uncertainty
and ennui. Who can blame them. The 70&#x27;s teenagers didn&#x27;t know how to
define themselves. The post-Watergate era was caught between the
cultural revolutions of the 1960&#x27;s and before the materialistic 1980&#x27;s
took effect. Women&#x27;s solidarity hadn&#x27;t come into status quo yet either.
We see freshman girls being hazed by the seniors through some
initiation ritual as the upper-class boys passively sit back and watch.
Ben Affleck (O&#x27;Bannion) and his bully cronies launch a rampage of
swatting upcoming freshman with big paddles. I guess some kids were so
bored and devoid of fun and games that they resorted to abusing the
younger kids due to their own lack of fulfillment and direction in
life. I persoanlly don&#x27;t recall paddling in high school. That actually
happened in college through the fraternity curcuit. But I do remember
bigger kids abusing younger ones.<br /><br />All the characters seem to be on an even keel. Each character has the
same adequate screen time as another. So we really don&#x27;t have any
leads, heroes or heroines, etc. The star quarterback, (London) seems
too mature for a high school kid. He exudes a sort of older brother
wisdom and rationale; it&#x27;s not an appropriate acting choice given his
age. Everyone else seems real in that you really can&#x27;t ask for much
when you take young actors and have them dress in shoddy 70&#x27;s clothes
and let them act indifferent and bored.
