Nobody can really say Dazed and Confused is not like high school, because
what they're really saying is that it wasn't like THEIR high school
experience. Personally, even though I went to school in the '90s, I found
plenty of similarities -- the small town, with nothing to do but drink and
smoke pot and drive around. <br /><br />But what the movie does more than connect factually with everyone's high
school experience is capture the ESSENCE of how high school students really
feel. The seniors' superiority. The need to find your own identity. Being
stuck in different social groups, but every once in a while having a great
time outside of one. The &quot;if I ever start referring to these as the best
days of my life, do me a favor and shoot me&quot; quote. Trying to rebel against
the teachers and coaches. <br /><br />It's kind of annoying that this was marketed as a stoner movie, because it's
really so much more. It's a fairly accurate portrayal of the thoughts and
actions of high school students, way more so than the 95% of all other teen
movie junk that doesn't resemble high school whatsoever.<br /><br />And the actors do look their age, for the most part. Some of the seniors
look a bit old, sure, but the freshman really look like freshman. It's
refreshing, since these days you turn on the TV to watch someone pushing
thirty pretend to go to her junior prom. <br /><br />Overall, Dazed and Confused is a real original, a high school movie that
really doesn't try to be anything more than an interesting and funny and
even poignant portrayal of high school students and their thoughts,
feelings, and experiences. No cute plots recycled from Shakespeare. No
romantic comedy lameness. Just real people and their lives.
