2001_March 20 

   Having graduated at about the same time as this crowd, I can tell you
that most of the characters are dead-on. It's a very good,if not great,
movie. I thought they went a bit overboard on the hazing angle...I mean I
know some of that stuff went on, but I don't remember carloads of seniors
with paddles chasing down incoming freshmen. Maybe it was a Texas thing. The
soundtrack was great but they really should have thrown in some Pink Floyd
and Todd Rundgren.    
   I recall spending quite a few nights with guys like the stoner...sitting
in small rooms lit only by a blacklight, passing a bong and crankin up the
tunes.
    All in all the movie reminded me of how great it was to 18 in the
early/mid seventies...after the craziness of the 60s and before disco,
punk,rap,Aids and MTV closed the party down.
