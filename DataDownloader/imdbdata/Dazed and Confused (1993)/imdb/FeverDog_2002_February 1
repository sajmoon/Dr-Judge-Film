I know I've seen DAZED AND CONFUSED too many times whenever I hear &quot;Slow
Ride&quot; and in that break in the song I always yell out &quot;Hirschfelder!,&quot; like
when that kid appears in the closing credits.  <br /><br />Now, what CD has that extended version of &quot;Slow Ride&quot;?<br /><br />I was one of the few who actually saw DAZED AND CONFUSED when it was in
theatres (thank you, AMC Deptford 8 in New Jersey).  At first I didn't think
much of it; the great reviews I had read about it caused me to be a bit
underwhelmed.  But since I'm in full disclosure mode right about now, I'll
admit that my third viewing of this movie coincided with the first time I
really got stoned.  Its clarity and beauty was finally revealed, and this is
a big reason why this film is so dear to me.<br /><br />DAZED AND CONFUSED is obviously in my all-time Top 10.  If you're looking
for an expert, you've found one.  I've been following the careers of every
actor in this classic - and not just the stars like Ben, Matthew and Parker.
 I'm talking Adam, Anthony, Rory, Sasha, Cole, Marissa, Nicky, and, of
course, Wiley (great to finally see him again in WAKING LIFE).  (And did you
know that's Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in the red-and-white striped tube top strolling
past Pink, Wooderson &amp; Mitch while they're hanging out in front of the
Emporium?)<br /><br />Only once a decade it seems that a &quot;teen&quot; movie speaks to an entire
generation and features scads of future stars.  The '70s had AMERICAN
GRAFFITI, the '80s had FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and the '90s had DAZED
AND CONFUSED.  What will this decade give us?  AMERICAN PIE?  I hope there's
a better representation of untainted talent on the horizon.<br /><br />Oops.  It's late (4:57 a.m.), and I haven't watch DAZED AND CONFUSED in
months; this brief wave of nostalgia overcame my inebriated self at this
cusp of a velvet morning. I'm not here to rehash whatever plot there is in
this magnificent film; I just wanted to once again bask in the glory of
DAZED AND CONFUSED, if only for a short while.<br /><br />FeverDog
