This is my review on dazed and confused. This movie is an instant
classic. I think it is a very accurate representation of high school
life for most teens. This movie is fun, funny and a great watch. <br /><br />This movie follows a group of friends in the 70s on their last day of
school. They make sure to fill their day by smoking a lot of marijuana
and drinking a lot of beer and going to parties. If you remember being
a teenager this most likely sounds familiar to you. The movie follows
them as they befriend a younger kid and kind of take him under their
wing as it were.<br /><br />Now this movie does not have much of a story line or much of a back
story. It kind of just follows the people around and you just watch and
enjoy. There also is not much character development that is the reason
I only give it a 7.<br /><br />Besides that though this movie is filled with fun moments great acting
and a wonderful script. It is very believable and fun to watch. Its not
exactly a comedy but it does have its funny moments and it is very
enjoyable to watch.
