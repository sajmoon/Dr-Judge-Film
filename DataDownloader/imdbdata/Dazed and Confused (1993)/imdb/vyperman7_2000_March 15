I love this movie, and I have probably seen it now, at least 4 times. It
gets funnier every time I see it. By far, the scenes with oncoming
freshman
getting hazed are the funniest. I only wish that I could have hazed
oncoming
freshman when I was a Senior. O Bannon is hilarious. So is the rest of the
cast. The place that they hung out at was great too. It was great when the
geek got his ass kicked and then stared to cry. That was great. &quot; Your
f***in dead, you facist&quot; then he starts to cry. it was great. My favorite
parts of the movies are the hazing, where JR throws the bowling ball
through
the window, and where the fat guy gets dragged along the ground when they
take off. The women in this movie are HOT too! A great
movie
