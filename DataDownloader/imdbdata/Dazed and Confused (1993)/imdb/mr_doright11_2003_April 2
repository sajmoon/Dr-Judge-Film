2003_April 2 

This was a really cool movie. In my opinion, even though it was a different
time and styles and rituals were different in those days (if seniors tried
publicly paddling freshman today, they'd probably go to jail), I think that
kids today can relate to Dazed and Confused. I don't mean everything, but
little things.<br /><br />This is just a fun movie to watch. There's a lot of good music (Alice Cooper
and Aerosmith!), and the kids are all very believable. At first I thought
the whole seniors hanging out with freshman at parties was total bulls**t,
but I soon came to realize that it very well can happen (although I didn't
have to get my ass paddled first). I also liked the fact that the movie
wasn't just about getting stoned, even though that is a lot of the movie. I
thought at first the whole movie was just gonna be 90 minutes of kids taking
bong hits, but that actually isn't a very big part of the
movie.<br /><br />I think my favorite characters in this movie are Slater and Wooderson.
Slater was just funnier than hell, and Wooderson was like this cool guy who
was also kind of a scum bag, but he seemed so innocent about trying to pick
up younger chicks. Wooderson's classic line in this movie was &quot;that's what i
like about these freshman girls... I get older, they stay the same age&quot;. I
love it. It's a little creepy, yet really funny too. I also liked Pink
(partially because his name his Pink Floyd). I thought he was a good
character. He is like the popular guy that everyone in school likes.<br /><br />My only problems with this movie was that there was no Pink Floyd (there
were dark side of the moon posters everywhere, but no Floyd), and no
Zeppelin. I could have swore they were going to play the song 'Dazed and
Confused', but no dice. Other than that I loved it. It was really funny, and
I can't say this from experience, but all the people i asked that went ot
high school in the 70's said it was fairly accurate. I can say it was
accurate in capturing high school kid's in general. A great flick! 10/10
