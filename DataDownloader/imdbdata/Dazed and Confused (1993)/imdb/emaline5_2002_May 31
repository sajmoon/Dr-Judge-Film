The condition of the video which had &quot;4:20 forever&quot; and happy faces smoking
pot drawn all over it should have been a pretty quick indicator of the crap
that awaited me.  How can this come from the same guy who directed the
EXHAUSTING yet wonderful Waking Life?  Mostly everything in this movie was
unlikely, lazy, stereotypical.<br /><br />UGH!  The only two likable characters and good actors in this movie were
the
two straight guys (the director's mouthpiece Adam Goldberg and the sweet
blonde).  I think that Wiley Wiggins was suppose to be the cute freshman,
but he was just pathetic and a bad actor.<br /><br />Everything, save for those two actors, SUCKED.  The soundtrack sucked.  The
clothes sucked.  Well, the 70s sure did suck.  And none of those &quot;wacky
conspiracy&quot; theories from Rory Cochrane were amusing.  And since when was
there this fierce rivalry between seniors and freshman?  Laughable I
say.
