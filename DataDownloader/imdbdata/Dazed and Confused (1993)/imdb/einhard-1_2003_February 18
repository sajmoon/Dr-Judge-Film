Rarely have I seen a movie that could have been written from my life. While
the events were fictional, the attitudes were true to life. This movie was
the 1970's for the America that didn't live in New York or Los Angeles and
hated disco---not because for some supposed homophobic or racist reason, but
because disco sucked!
Party on.
