Richard Linklater takes a journey down memory lane with a trip to 1976, the
last day of School. Nothing too deep as we follow a bunch of students out to
have a good time in their own little way. With films like these, you expect
the growing up pains and all that other teenage angst. But Linklater shows
it how it really was and how I remembered it to be; with the simple things
in life, like drugs, booze, love and just hanging out with the guys that
made it fun.
