i remember being 16 and seeing this film late one night, and thinking it was
the coolest thing ever. I taped it of course, and continued to watch it
religiously for like 2 weeks. And even now, i have to watch it at least
twice a year. Set in the 70's, it traces the lives of several teenagers
during one whole day. Not much of a plot, but with razor sharp dialogue, an
amazing soundtrack, brilliant actors, and an atmosphere so relaxed and fun,
you don't need a plot. Richard Linklater has his finger on the pulse of
teenager-dom during that particular time, which makes it almost real to
watch. You begin to feel a part of the film, like the characters are your
friends, and their problems are your problems. The script is so dead on, and
hysterically funny, fleshing out every character so that you can always
relate to one of them. A one in a million film.
