Dazed and Confused is a great, funny movie that brought back some good
memories of my high school days. I did not go to high school in the
1970&#x27;s but many things that take place in this movie happened at my
high school just in a different decade.<br /><br />This is about the last day of school at a Texas high school in 1976 and
what happened the rest of that day and night.<br /><br />It was refreshing to see actors before they got famous. I barely
recognized Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey. The cast did an
excellent job.<br /><br />The soundtrack is amazing. There are many great classic rock bands I
enjoy such as Aerosmith, Lynryd Skynyrd, and Foghat.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun movie. I forgot how girls used to use pliers to
fit in their jeans. That doesn&#x27;t happen much nowadays. I rate this film
8/10.
