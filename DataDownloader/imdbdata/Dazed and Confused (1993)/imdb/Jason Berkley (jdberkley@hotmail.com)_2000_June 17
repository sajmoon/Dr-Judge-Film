One of the best, most humane films ever made about young people and the
choices they must learn to make. Not a single second of this film feels
false, and Linklater deserves immense credit for his keen eye for
talent (just look at the number of names you recognize in this cast-- none
of
them were even up-and-comers in 1993). This is one of the best American
films of the 1990's.
