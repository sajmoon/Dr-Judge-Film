1999_April 11 

This film is so incredibly accurate it's almost like a documentary. Everyone
no matter when or where they grew up will recognize the characters in this
movie. We all knew an all round cool guy (Pink),a psychotic idiot
(O'Banion),a lovable stoner (Slater),and those geeks whose names you can't
remember.<br /><br />The film also manages to avoid the sentimental cliches of lesser teen
flicks. Nobody goes nuts, nobody breaks down and kills themselves. You feel
as though you could watch this film forever, but all great things come to an
end. You'll just have to buy a copy and watch it over and over again. Trust
me, this is one film you won't ever tire of.
