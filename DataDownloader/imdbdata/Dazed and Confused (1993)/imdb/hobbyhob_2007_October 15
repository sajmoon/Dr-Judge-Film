While this is a pretty accurate picture of high school at that time,
some of the music was off, at least for a &quot;class of 76-er&quot; from Nor
Cal. We were listening more to Jackson Browne, the Eagles, CSNY, Linda
Ronstadt, Dave Mason, Neil Young and the like. Sure, Lynryd Skynyrd
(sp?), Frampton and Foghat were a part of our soundtrack, but where
were the above mentioned bands, and Robin Trower, Led Zepplin, Kansas,
and many, many more? Still, all in all, I love this film - especially I
loved seeing young Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey (Matt&#39;s hair
cracked me up &#39;cuz I knew guys who wore their hair EXACTLY like that!!
- sad but true). The cars, clothes, and general scene/look of the film
was dead on - kudos to the art department on this pic. It&#39;s a
wonderfully enjoyable flashback to a time that was both special and sad
all at the same time.
