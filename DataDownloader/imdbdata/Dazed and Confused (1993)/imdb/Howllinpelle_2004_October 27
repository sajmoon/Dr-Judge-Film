This is my fav movie ever, I first saw it about when I was 11 or 12 and
it showed me the true meaning of Christmas. I mean being a teenager, I
love the 70's I love led zep i love marijuana i would so love to have
lived that life. i cant but i try the best i can :-}.if i see this is
on TV i will watch it no matter what i have to cancel to see, no other
movie does this to me, I've seen it 7 times(not a lot by sum standards)
which is i think the most i ever have seen a movie I love the whole
culture , the hazings(ouch) the senior trying to get beer, when i first
saw it i couldn't understand why they couldn't get it i hadn't realized
USA has sum preety strict alcohol laws. the amount of future stars here
is amazing Ben affleck Matthew mcConnehy(i cant spell.lol)Rory Cochran
Mila jovovich. But i always have wanted to c Wiley Wiggins(Mitch) in
another movie. He was like my role model well him and William furlong
from terminator2 they were the 2 best young actors i have ever seen and
the coolest. You must see this movie. Oh the soundtrack rocks too. to
cut a long story short.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS MOVIE :-)<br /><br />peace Se&aacute;n
