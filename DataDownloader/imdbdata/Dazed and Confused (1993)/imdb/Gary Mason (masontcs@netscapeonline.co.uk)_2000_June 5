Slater, Mitch and co. are just teens who want to have fun. If you are
thinking this is just another teen film, then you are wrong. This is a film
for young adults. The school is out for the summer and all they want to do
is party and get stoned. This film lets you watch them trying to achieve
their goal.
The acting, story and music are all top class. You will watch this film,
then you will rewind it and watch it again.<br /><br />
