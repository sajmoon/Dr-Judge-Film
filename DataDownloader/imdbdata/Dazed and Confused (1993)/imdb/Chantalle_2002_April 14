It's a simple movie to watch, just sit back and see watch since it doesn't
take a lot of thinking. The plot isn't huge and it has all kinds of
conflicts that all teens experience, but not really solutions to go with
it.
You don't really learn anything or learn a lesson. You just enjoy since it
is such a fun movie!<br /><br />They even show little parts for you get a tiny sample of what it might
have
been like. One part, when girls are getting ready for a party...one person
has to suck-in and lie on the bed just to zip up the zipper on her
bell-bottoms since they are just that tight! I know for sure if I asked my
mother, she could recall her and all the girls wearing extremely tight
jeans.<br /><br />This was an awesome movie and I really recommend it to only teenagers
since
your parents might make it less fun by going and no one. It isn't for kids
of a young age (BEST for 14 and up). If I could change anything...there
would be a lot less pot smoking.<br /><br />Enjoy everyone,
By the way, Slater is the best! He's awesome!
