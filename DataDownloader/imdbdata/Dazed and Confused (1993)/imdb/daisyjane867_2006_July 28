This movie is one that I could re-watch over and over, because it
reminds me of junior-high (in the 70&#39;s) and high school (in the 80&#39;s).
I could relate to every character and could picture a particular
student I went to school with to every character in the movie. In fact,
every time I watch this movie I cry. It is such a powerful reminder of
what we had at that time. We had it and now it is gone. 1976 is gone.
The best years of our lives, gone. I wanted out then, but would give
anything to return back. Dazed and Confused lets me re-live my life
from 1976-1985. It is one of my favorite movies, by far, so go RENT IT,
dude!
