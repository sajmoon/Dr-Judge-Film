This is one of those slim-budget, generation-defining movies that
appeal mostly to those that lived through the times depicted or to
those young kids who wish they had. First of all, if I wanted to see a
bunch of high school deadbeats do nothing but get stoned, I would just
go back to school and videotape them. The movie offers a non-existing
plot, just a countless number of irritating characters placed in random
circumstances. I don't mind a large ensemble cast but I do mind when
I'm given too many one-dimensional characters with no purpose
whatsoever. The movie only makes you want to beat up some of these kids
in bad 70's hairdo's and tight clothes. The only treat coming out of
this lame and uninteresting movie is an early look at up-and-coming
actors like Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey. The rest seem to be
actors with minimal acting experience trying to come up with things to
say as they go along. You literally have to be dazed and confused in
order to like this movie. Maybe the title even refers to how director
and writer Richard Linklater felt while creating it. A definite dud of
a movie over-hyped by its cult following!
