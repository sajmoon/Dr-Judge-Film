    See it once, twice, even twenty times....just don't *not* see it! The
comedy in this movie is the kind that you laugh with a friend if they say
something funny. It's very good-natured comedy, and I'm sure for older
viewers, that it's a reminder of their past.<br /><br />    Killer soundtack, loved all the characters; all in all, a great popcorn
flick to watch with some buds(yes).<br /><br />-Sep<br /><br />ps.- I forgot to mention that Joey Lauren Adams is in this flick! Another
great reason to see it!
