If anything is likely to put a smile on your face, it's this movie. I
promise you that after watching this cinematic classic you will want to
throw on some flares and go hang out in a wood with some mates. The cast
of
then up and comings, now fully fledged stars, is fantastic - a special
shout
out to Rory Cochrane who reigns supreme as stoner &quot;Slater&quot; - Man you
rock!!!
Great movie, great cast, great night out.
