&#39;Dazed and Confused&#39; is one of those rare movies that&#39;s not
&#39;feel-good,&#39; but nevertheless makes you feel good. All the components
(cast, setting, story, soundtrack) combine in this film to make for a
unique, enjoyable, nostalgia-inducing experience, even for someone who
wasn&#39;t alive in the &#39;70s.<br /><br />The characters are well-developed, mixing elements of &#39;good guy&#39; and
&#39;bad guy&#39; in several character, with only two notable personas, Darla
(Parker Posey) and O&#39;Bannion (Ben Affleck) not leaving you wishing they
were your friends.<br /><br />All in all, this movie&#39;s a great way to spend a rainy afternoon,
especially if you&#39;ve got a couple of six-packs and a group of pals to
share it with.
