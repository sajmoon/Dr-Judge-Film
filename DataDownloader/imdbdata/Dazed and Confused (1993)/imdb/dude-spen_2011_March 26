I have watched this movie 6 times, now. It&#x27;s not a great movie with any
great story or brilliant acting. It is just a simple movie that you
will always love to watch again and again. The story just spans around
half a day and it is like going through a compilation of great records
with life happening around. This is one of the greatest high school
films of all time for me. The events that happen just after the school
closes for the summer form the basic plot of the movie. Well, nothing
much happens, story wise, but at the end of the movie you will
definitely want to watch more of those high school punks, jerks,
stoners, geeks and freshmen and their talks. I mean, that is exactly
what the people behind this wanted. This movie is neither a dramatic
experience nor one in which you will be laughing your asses off but
this movie will bring out some smiles and satisfaction. I will
definitely rate this movie 10 on 10 and the director- writer guy,
Linklater, is a brilliant storyteller.<br /><br />~ dillitalkies.blogspot.com ~
