this movie is awesome. im in high school now and i think this movie is
pretty close to how it really is. the jocks (benny, don, melvin), the
cheerleaders (jodi, shavonne, simone), the nerds (tony, mike, cynthia),
the
stoners (slater, pickford, michelle), the.. mean people (o'bannion, darla)
and of course pink, the popular guy, and wooderson, the old guy who still
hangs around. i will never ever get sick of watching this movie. every
time
i watch it (which is very often) i feel like going to a party. wooderson
and
slater are my favourite characters. i love the part when slater asks mitch
if hes &quot;cool&quot;. haha.. hes hilarious. i think i like it because it has no
plot, much like my life. wake up, hang out, party is pretty much it. the
only things that bugged me were mike (i dont like how he talks) and the
fact
that mitch touches his nose like 30 times. other than that its excellent.
ok
thats enough.. check you later!!
