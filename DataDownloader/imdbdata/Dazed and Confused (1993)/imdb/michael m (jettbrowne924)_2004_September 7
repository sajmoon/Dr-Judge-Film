This movie rocks...And I am not only speaking of the soundtrack. What a
panoply of up and comers. Parker Posey! Milla J! Adam Goldberg!Rory
Cochrane...Okay, I'm stretching here, but I hate to mention that
card-board cut outs Matt McCoughnehey and Ben AFF-lack are in it also.
Plus, Beck's Scientologist wife, Marisa Ribisi(sis of Giovani),
daughter of Casting Agent. Actually, Marissa R. was great and it
bothers me to think that because she died her hair red and played the
&quot;fugly&quot; nerd that she was typecast for future work. Hollywood guys have
it all wrong. I'm sure John Hughes had to fight for Molly Ringwald. The
soundtrack even supercede's this great movie, which captures keggers'
in the woods and clicks which inter-mingle. Jason London? What happened
to you? I wish his kind character portrayal would have prompted him
into heart-throb status. But then again, if that did happen to him, I
probably would not like him. Watch this movie. Okay?
