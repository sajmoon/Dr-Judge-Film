Dazed and Confused (1993)<br /><br />Cast: Jason London, Rory Cochrane, Sasha Jenson, Wiley Wiggins,

Adams, Jason O. Smith, Ben Affleck, Christin Hinjosa, Parker Posey,
Nicky Katt.<br /><br />Directed by Richard Linklater.<br /><br />&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is one of the best teen films ever made, and for
many reasons. It stands the test of it's time, along with George Lucas'
&quot;American Graffiti&quot; and John Landis' &quot;Animal House&quot;. It shows the highs
and lows of partying, friendship, and drugs. The plot is about upcoming
seniors and freshmen in a Texas town on the full last day of School in
1976. The characters are very likable in this, well, at least most of
them. Richard Linklater gives a great independent direction. This isn't
a film that encourages kids to do drugs, but it shows a true portrayal
of teenagers in a America, in a very fun way. &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is
one of my all-time favorite films, and one that I can watch over and
over again. Well done.<br /><br />5/5 stars.
