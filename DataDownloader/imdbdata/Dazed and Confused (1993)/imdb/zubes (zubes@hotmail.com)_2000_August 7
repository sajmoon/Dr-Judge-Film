2000_August 7 

I think dazed and confused was an outstanding film. I'm only 18, so I don't
know if that's how they partied in the 70's or not, but it would be really
cool if it is. I am a big fan of this movie also because it boasts the
greatest sound track maybe ever. I also think if you indulge yourself the
way these characters do(YEAH!), this movie will move you even
more
