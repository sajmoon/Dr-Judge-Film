It's official...Dazed and Confused is THE GODFATHER of all teenage films
made in the 1990's.  It is on such a higher plain than movies like She's
All
That, You Drive Me Crazy, Clueless, and all of the other cheaply produced
PG-13 teen flicks.  Note: You cannot make an accurate teenage movie with a
PG-13.  High School life is at least Rated R and most of the time it is
NC-17.<br /><br />What sets Dazed and Confused apart is that it takes a time that has come
and
gone, the 1970's, and it proceeded to make the viewers feel like they were
living in that era.  With the music, the costumes, the car, the dialogue,
and the characterizations, Dazed and Confused used the 1970's to its
advantage while, in the process, keeping it real and giving people a
chance
to feel like they were living the movie.<br /><br />I saw the movie back when I was about 12 and then saw it again when I was
about 15 or 16.  From there, I was hooked.  My favorite scenes became the
part where &quot;Free Ride&quot; starts to play and then the whole initial
&quot;Emporium&quot;
scene.  Wooderson was priceless and he is everyone's example of a super
senior.  Slater was everyone's stoner friend and the list goes
on.<br /><br />What makes Dazed special to me is that it inspired me to go into
screenwriting.  I saw Dazed and then I saw all the poor teen films coming
out so I figured I needed to get off my rear and come up with real life
stories like Dazed and Confused.  I have Richard Linklater to thank for
that.<br /><br />In essence, Dazed and Confused is one of the three best teen films each
represented a different decade but kept it to where anyone could relate.
The other two films are American Grafiti for the late 50's and early 60's
and Fast Times at Ridgemont High for the 80's.<br /><br />Throw in The Breakfast Club and Varsity Blues(a distant second to Dazed
and
Confused this decade) and you have a slice of the past 4 decades of
teenage
life represented in film.<br /><br />In closing, I quote Wooderson: &quot;You just got to keep livin...
L-I-V-I-N!&quot;
