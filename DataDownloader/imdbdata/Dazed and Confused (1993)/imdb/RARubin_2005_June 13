I must admit that I haven't seen Slacker, Linklater's previous look at
1976 high school, but I was impressed that a very peculiar time of
cultural history has not been forgotten; indeed, has been immortalized,
high school and the sociological angst of teenagers. Because the teen
years are a joke to begin with, even tragedy seems perversely amusing
through the looking glass of time. The boys resemble David Cassidy, or
Roger Staubach. The girls all look like Stevi Nicks. The patter is
accurate with stoner kids talking like black folks sort of. I'm high
man, so high, blah, black, pass the bong. You get the idea.<br /><br />The hazing incidents, boys getting paddled, girls getting slimed, seem
to be a small town, Mid-Western ritual, I'm not familiar with in my
secure East Coast cottage, but I thought it was fascinating when the
senior, dominatrix in training chick, whips the little freshman girls
into shape, hmm, perverse.<br /><br />Every teen film has to have a party and these kids get bombed outdoors,
a massive Jagger and bong fest. One of the last scenes, a romance on a
blanket was unexpected, and I will not spoil it. Is there anything new
or important here to learn about kids or their world? No, not much, but
film is amusing at times, and it certainly nails a time and place.
Watch for future stars like Ben Affleck.
