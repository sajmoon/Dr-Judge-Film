Am I the only one who sees how completely pointless this movie is? It
is about nothing; nothing at all. There is no plot and nothing happens.
It isn&#39;t even funny. It&#39;s about the last day of high school in the
&#39;70s, and some dumb one-dimensional character who refuses to get a
paper signed.. or something. And why does everyone love Slater (some
standard hippie guy who says nothing important and smokes a lot of
weed)? Is that why everyone likes this movie? because it&#39;s &quot;about
weed&quot;? oh wait it&#39;s not even ABOUT weed, sure it&#39;s incorporated into
the movie, but honestly, that&#39;s not even the main focus of the film.
The main focus of the film is.. well, nothing, as i&#39;ve said before.
Maybe I&#39;m just not seeing the humour? I mean, it&#39;s not like i&#39;m not up
for a silly movie without deep intellectual meaning - I loved Eurotrip,
Harold &amp; Kumar, and many others. But honestly, I&#39;m one of the very few
people i&#39;ve talked to who don&#39;t like this film. Most people who bring
up the film are almost always very enthusiastic about it, and quick to
reprimand me once i tell them I didn&#39;t like it. &quot;DAZED AND CONFUSED IS
LIKE THE BEST MOVIE EVER DUDE!!!&quot; Eh, no. At this point, my belief is
that one dimwit saw the movie, loved it, and went on to convince his
friends of its worth, who went on to convince their friends, and so on.
Does anyone HONESTLY like this movie??
