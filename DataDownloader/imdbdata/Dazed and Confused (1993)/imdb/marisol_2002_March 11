The title of this film&quot;Dazed&amp;Confused&quot;is like that old Led Zeppelin
song
I first saw this movie when I was 18 years old and I really felt
connected.D&amp;C was one of the last great&quot;coming of age&quot;films which it subject
focus on teenagers from the 70s,a different decade but this movie was
released in the nineties and for that reason it shares the same spirit of
the so-called &quot;generation x&quot;.<br /><br />Young boys who loved music and Rock more than sex,(the guys from &quot;American
Pie&quot; or &quot;40 Days 40 nights&quot;they only live thinking in sex)
,and they seem to worship friendship,parties and Aerosmith in a candid
way.<br /><br />The young ones only dream of sex,&quot;the old ones&quot; seem tired of
it.
Richard Linklater achieves in portraying a honest view of the
youth,
the innocence and the wild.My favorite scene is when they are all together
in that party,&quot;loser&quot; and &quot;popular&quot;...that doesn't matter
here.
