I think this was a really good movie. I think most of the characters
were funny like don he was one of the funnest guys in the movie.I think
slather was pretty funny and Pickford and his girl.i think i can relate
to Slater and Pickford just relaxing and smoking and just having fun
just L I V I N. i though O'Bannion was kind of a dick in this movie but
for the most part most of the football players were funny even tho
there were only 4 guys that they showed but some of the girl were
pretty hot. I like when the nerd gets in the fight with that one dude
at the party that was kinda funny.i also like Wooderson i think its
funny when Mitch ask how it was going then he said &quot;a man you got a
joint&quot; then Mitch said no then he said &quot;it be a lot cooler if you did
but really i think the whole movie was funny. i think the should make
another movie about the 80s yea man.
