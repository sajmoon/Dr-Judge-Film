I went to see this movie when it was on its original run in the
theaters and was completely blown away as I had no idea what it was all
about until after I was in my seat watching it.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused portrayed exactly the way I remember my teenage
years and damn near every character in this film resembled someone I
knew back then (and if you grew up during the same era, you will
probably see yourself in this film, too, and maybe even your old car).<br /><br />Along with &quot;Over the Edge,&quot; this movie has to be the most accurate
portrayal of what life was like in the 70&#39;s for many high school kids
all across America (the hip and stoned ones anyway, I guess I should
add).<br /><br />Probably not for everyone, but definitely worth a look, even if you
don&#39;t agree with the drug use, sexual humor and/or defiant attitudes.
