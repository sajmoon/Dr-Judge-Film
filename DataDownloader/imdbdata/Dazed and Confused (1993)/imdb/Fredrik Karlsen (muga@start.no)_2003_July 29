This movie, that I have seen about 100-150 times through the years, must
be
one of the best movies ever. Not only that the characters are perfectly
fit
to their role, and not only that it`s a &quot;funny drama&quot;, but the movie in
it
selves has got life. It`s just something in it, that can turn anyone in
love
with it!<br /><br />This movie was also a BIG breakthrough for almost every character in
it.<br /><br />This is a 10'er
