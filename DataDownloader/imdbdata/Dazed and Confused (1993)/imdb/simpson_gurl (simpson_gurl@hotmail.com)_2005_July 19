i LOVED this movie . . . I've watched it like 10 times in the past day
and a half! . . . I've read some of the comments on this movie . . .
and most of them say how much it's exactly like how it was as a teen in
76 ...well . . . I'm a teen . . . and its pretty much exactly the same
as mi life lol . . . but yea . . . i just loved it . . . end of story .
. . if u haven't seen it . . . i HIGHLY recommend renting it . . . or
even buying it . . . u will absolutely love it! . . . and Slater just
makes the movie amazing . . . he is such a stoner, its awesome! . . .
and mi favourite scene is when he's talking about George Washington lol
. . . i couldn't stop laughing at that part! . . . anyways . . . I'm
off to watch it again! =) . . . i hope this comment helped
