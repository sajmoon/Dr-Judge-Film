Rated R for Language,Drug Use and Sexual Content. Quebec Rating:13+
Canadian Home Video Rating:14A<br /><br />Dazed and Confused is a hilarious and great movie about teenage life in
the 1970&#39;s.This film is basically a version of American Graffiti which
takes place in the 1970&#39;s as opposed to graffiti which takes place in
the 60&#39;s.This was my favorite movie about five years ago and I have
seen the film at least six times.Dazed and Confused is about a group of
teenagers during one day in Austin, Texas in the year 1976.It shows the
&quot;freshman&quot; students and the seniors and the relationship between
them.The film has an excellent soundtrack consisting of great 1970&#39;s
hits! Dazed and Confused is a great film that I recommend.
