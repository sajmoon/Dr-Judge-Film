A great cast of yet-to-be stars, a great script and a movie that
reflects what it was like to grow up in the &#39;70&#39;s as a high school kid.
Ya, we got baked partied hard and focused on the opposite sex - as they
did in decades past, well maybe not baked, but you get the idea.<br /><br />This is a coming-of-age movie much like American Graffiti. It was one
of the first things that came to me after first watching this movie and
while it may not have the same mass appeal for anyone who grew up in
the mid-70&#39;s it brings back memories of parties, friends, school and of
course the music. Great soundtrack.<br /><br />We didn&#39;t have the initiation ritual at my school, thank god, but
everything else was pretty much the same. If you grew up then, if you
didn&#39;t but are interested in that time or a fan of &#39;That 70&#39;s Show&#39;,
this is a definite must-see.
