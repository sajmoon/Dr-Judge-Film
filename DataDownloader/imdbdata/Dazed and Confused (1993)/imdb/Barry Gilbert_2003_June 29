Simply one of the best American films of the 1990s and one of the greatest
examples of American naturalism, there can be few greater examples of a
director's genuine fondness for his characters.<br /><br />With an ensemble cast that has rarely been equaled, you don't need to be
from Texas to be reminded of your high school days and of the excitement and
pressures of bein' young.  The dozen or so main characters are augmented by
dozens more we see only in glimpses - the annoyed girl left mid-kiss, the
easy-going washed up convenience clerk, the clumsy girl who laughs at
herself after a face-forward fall.  Linklater has populated a world with
easy-going profundity and a warmth that matches the summer of '76 portrayed.
