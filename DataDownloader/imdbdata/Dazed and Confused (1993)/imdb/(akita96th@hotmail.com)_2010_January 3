I graduated in 1973 in a small town NC and I tell you that movie hit it
right on the head. I can say that most small town schools were pretty
much the same way ,hell from 1973 to 1976 time sort of stood still and
we all lived in that magical age of pot and wow man sort of cool
attitude lol. Every time I watch this movie it immediately takes me
back to those days of innocence before P-tests and drug task force
agents wandering the halls of high schools cutting open lockers doing
their search trips and it was so easy to go out and have fun and not be
politically correct and stuck in the garbage we now call modern
civilization. Those were truly the times of memories back then it
didn&#x27;t matter what clothes you wore or what brand or what car you drove
hell if you had 4 wheels that run and you had a DL man you was cool .
