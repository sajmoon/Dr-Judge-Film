One of the best comedies of the 90s without a doubt. <br /><br />I first saw this when first released on video - I&#39;d seen Linklater&#39;s
hyped, earlier(SLACKER), which was a major cult classic that I wasn&#39;t
especially fond of. This took the roving camera of SLACKER, added a
vague story, or a context at least (the last day of high school, and
the following night), cut the characters down to a manageable number,
sent it back in time and created an independent film classic. I watched
this with a roomful of friends from college, circa 1993, and we were
hysterical. <br /><br />It helps that this is a well made film - expressive cinematography at
times (the brief scene with Milla Jovovich on the hood of the car at
sundown, as Edgar Winter&#39;s &quot;Free Ride&quot; plays in the background stands
out, leading into the cruising scenes). I was just a kid in the 70s,
too young for any of this (I was just in time for the BREAKFAST
CLUB/PRETTY IN PINK years, though my Charlotte NC high school was
nowhere near as cool or pleasant), but these scenes conjured up great
memories of hanging out with friends on humid Southern summer nights,
and it&#39;s the quality of the cinematography as much as anything that
makes DAZED connect. <br /><br />I never took this to be that accurate of a 70s period piece (compare
with it&#39;s dark and great companion of a sort: Ang Lee&#39;s ICE STORM,
which offers a somewhat more real glimpse of 70s detail, in service of
a much darker film) - but it&#39;s a great movie about being young, easily
among the best (along with American GRAFFITI, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT
HIGH, or COOLEY HIGH). It&#39;s just as idealized as a John Huges flick,
but far more spontaneous - the advantage of a cast that was then all
undiscovered talent given room to move - but considerably more
lifelike. There are no great statements - aside from allusions to
L-I-V-I-N&#39; and a very vaguely defined idea of youth-as-freedom,
presumably a desperately endangered ideal in the &quot;me decade.&quot; But - so
many movies about being young are lame, ridiculous, exploitative or
cheaply made - and this one ain&#39;t. This is the real deal. <br /><br />And - roundabout 1987, I was in the nerd car, and we were listening to
The Replacements&#39; &quot;Can&#39;t Hardly Wait&quot; instead of Frampton&#39;s &quot;Do You
Feel Like I Do.&quot;
