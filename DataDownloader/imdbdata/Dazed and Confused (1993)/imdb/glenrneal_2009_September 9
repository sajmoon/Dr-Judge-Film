What&#x27;s not to like about this movie? This has to be the most realistic
yet enjoyable teenage movies of all time. It really brings back a lot
of memories for me which shows just how real it is. This is a typical
teenager&#x27;s journey through life brought to the screen full of life,
humor and spirit. While never taking itself too seriously, it seeks to
show both young and old alike the joys and pitfalls of growing up in
America. While it would be great to go back to our youth knowing what
we know now, the first trip down the road of life is the best. This
movie makes me feel young again, and that&#x27;s the best credit I can give
it. I&#x27;m afraid today&#x27;s teens with their cell phones, internet and video
games will miss out on these experiences altogether. I think the &#x27;70s
were a unique time to live when the world was new, and I&#x27;m so glad I
made this journey in my life. There is a living spirit in this movie
like no other. The music soundtrack itself has spawned two CDs, which I
highly (no pun intended) recommend. As one of the tracks says,
&#x27;School&#x27;s out forever&#x27;, but if you want to relive those days, this
movie is for you. Good times indeed!
