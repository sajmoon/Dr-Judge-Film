Dazed And Confused - one of those movies that I&#x27;d been hearing about
for years and never managed to actually see until 2011, 18 years after
it was first released. The fact that the movie is set in the 70s means
that it hasn&#x27;t dated in any terrible way as it was already a &#x22;period
piece&#x22;. The fact that it&#x27;s completely brilliant was a big surprise to
me.<br /><br />Richard Linklater wrote and directed this coming-of-age story about a
group of junior high students killing time on their last day of school
and threatening the incoming youngsters who have a whole summer of
dread ahead of them, thanks to initiation rites and general bullies.
That&#x27;s, essentially, all there is to the movie - it&#x27;s a character piece
built around that feeling of boredom, freedom, uncertainty and the
confidence of youth.<br /><br />When I first put the shiny disc of Dazed And Confused in my player I
was hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t bore me too much. The description given,
and my own comment above falls into the same trap, doesn&#x27;t reveal
anything about the quality of the movie. It makes it seem like
something all about nothing.<br /><br />Featuring a superb soundtrack (especially for Aerosmith fans), lots of
wonderful little moments and a fractured, interweaving series of
character arcs, Dazed And Confused compares favourably to that other
coming-of-age classic, American Graffiti.<br /><br />The script sounds authentic enough, the camera-work is capable if
unspectacular but the big draw here is the cast, full of great actors
and people who would go on to become leading stars in their own right -
Jason London and Wylie Wiggins are the heart of the movie, Ben Affleck
makes a great dickhead, Cole Hauser is fine, Rory Cochrane is hilarious
as the majorly dazed participant, Adam Goldberg steals almost every
scene he&#x27;s in, Matthew McConaughey is fantastic and we also get
Michelle Burke, Shawn Andrews, Milla Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams,
Parker Posey, Nicky Katt and a teeny tiny part for Renee Zellweger
(she&#x27;s the one pouring the beer into the tube and funnel arrangement
for Parker Posey to chug).<br /><br />I&#x27;ve not mentioned everyone I should because the movie was so busy and
so full of great incidents that I simply can&#x27;t separate every detail I
need to in order to give a specific breakdown of the plus points which,
I think, is praise enough in itself and should encourage others to give
this movie a go if, like me, they somehow haven&#x27;t already seen it by
now.
