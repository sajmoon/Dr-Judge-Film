This film portrays my high school generation, and while it gets some
things
dead on, (the clothing, the hair, the obsession with pot,) it is
painfully
obvious the film-makers are catering to a generation far removed from the
Texas high school experience of 1976.<br /><br />The music is fantastic, but it should have been used to better underscore
the differences between what, in reality, was highly segregated groups.
(See
&quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; to see it done effectively.) &quot;Rock music&quot;
had
yet to become the homogenized sound of today, and every kid was
identified
intimately with their chosen flavor. The drifting apart of childhood
friendships were actually affected by a change in ones musical tastes.
While
some of us easily moved from one group to the next, it wasn't common. In
our
world, Aerosmith folks wouldn't have rubbed elbows with the Kiss army if
they could help it, and Frampton fans would have been foolish to
make their preferences too loudly known. Missing is &quot;The Eagles&quot; and the
ignoring of Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is incomprehensible,
especially as Jason London's character was nicknamed Randall 'Pink' Floyd
in
the film.<br /><br />At times the characters bear an uncanny resemblance to reality, making it
easy to mentally identify them with their real-life counterparts of so
long
ago. The accents are missing (except by Matthew McConaughey, of course)
and
the frequent use of &quot;the F word&quot; blows it for me every time. The
eagerness
to use that word in common conversation is not from my generation, as it
was
generally used for shock effect, and then, rarely in mixed company.<br /><br />I suppose if I hadn't lived through those times, I'd see this film
differently, but as it stands, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; only serves to remind
me
that the times have changed, and in some ways, not for the
better.<br /><br />
