There are two common ways of approaching a film that focuses on teens,
wait, edit that, two common ways of generalising teenagers. One of
those ways is to say that teenagers are fuelled with angst, confused
and frustration, the other is to show teens as drug obsessed and
sex-crazed maniacs. Few of them succeed in creating the more valid,
profound and honest interpretation of teen life.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused is a film without a story, but that is intentional
because the film is about depicting the best years of our lives and
when you can just do things in your time and the way you want them.
Dazed and Confused, quite simply charts the story of a bunch of
high-school teens&#39; traditions and interests on the first night of the
&#39;76 summer, centred around a massive party.<br /><br />I find it impossible how somebody could not enjoy, or even merely
relate to even some of the smallest aspect of Dazed and Confused
because it is documenting the teen culture that everyone is apart of.
For a film that is centred on the &#39;70s it still manages to captivate
and identify with Generation X viewers today. The wide variety of
flamboyant characters in Dazed and Confused are the people we all know
as teens. The characters are people you know/knew in school and are
detailed with finesse. Nevertheless, without becoming clich&eacute;d the
characters burst with the nature of youth and bond you have with the
people you know. Dazed and Confused is a true interpretation of life,
it has an almost documentary effect lingering around it.<br /><br />One of the few problems with Dazed and Confused is the acting, which is
very bland and unprofessional. I felt some of the actors and actresses
did not have the same dedication as others did. Dazed and Confused
still managed to launch many careers, for the young American
performers, obviously having an awesome memory of acting in such an
iconic modern classic. Richard Linklater provides everything to fit the
era and adds a deliciously fashionable &#39;70s soundtrack. The script is
genius, mixing hysterical comedy, pop-culture and elements of drama
perfectly. There are dark undertones behind the fun and games in Dazed
and Confused, yet it is best you find them out for yourself.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused shows how being a teenager is somewhat like a
metaphor for an open road of possibilities. Ultimately, Dazed and
Confused captures everything about teen life and includes the needed
nostalgic, bittersweet brilliance of youth.
