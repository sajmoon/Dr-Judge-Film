2001_January 20 

I don't know what planet I was on, but I did not even become aware of this
movie until last year when my 18 year old nephew recommended I see it.
And
I live in Austin, the city where the movie was filmed no less.  Duh!  I am
a
living example of what happens to a person that acted like the kids in
this
film.  A few too many brain cells lost and I am paying for it
now.<br /><br />Having gone to school in the sixties and seventies in Texas, I was totally
transfixed when all of a sudden I was visually transported back to my teen
years.  It was uncanny.  I was able to re-live that glorious time with
those
wonderful friendships, sex, drugs and the awesome rock and roll, at least
for a couple of hours, and I relished it.  I knew Wooderson, the guy
always
talking about his Holly carb and his Hurst 4 speed.  I partied hard with
Slater.  I had the intelligent conversation with Mike and Cynthia.  And I
lusted after those seemingly unattainable popular senior girls.  Only the
names and faces were different.<br /><br />Perhaps almost everyone can relate in some way to this film and its
characters, scenes and places.  That is its beauty.  It reassures us with
its truths.  Richard Linklater is a master at bringing us a small slice of
life out of the pie of time.  This film may not be a masterpiece, but it
is
one I will always cherish, even after many repeated viewings.
