people who haven't seen this movie be warned for laughing your ass off,
it's a great movie which makes you want to be a young adult in the
70's, what can i say flower power, rock, relationships and great
friendship, not to mention pot and beer and respect. This movie also
has two great soundtrack's which makes you sing out loud with friends
or yourself, i should no i play it in my car a lot especially driving
down those open country fields. Check it out!!!! hope it becomes a
movie that its passed down the line of other young adults I'm now 25
and i still watch this film quite a lot. roll out the popcorn and
crisps or cheesy puffs and enjoy a free ride.
