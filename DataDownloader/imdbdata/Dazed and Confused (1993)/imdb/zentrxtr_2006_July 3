Gotta add my comment although its all been said. This movie is genius,
I&#39;m just glad to hear it from people who WEREN&#39;T there (too young,
etc.). This is pure time travel for me as well, but to get all that
right, the details and nuances, that is Linklater. AND I am from
Westerville, Ohio so really I needed Linklater to show me that this was
a common experience, because when you are from Huntsville, or
Westerville or whatever, and it is that crazy while you are growing up
in neo-mall America at a point in time that specific, you don&#39;t really
EXPECT other people to have your experience, and certainly not down to
the haircut of the guy who already graduated who still hangs out with
&quot;us&quot;. Frampton, yeah, sure, of course, whatever, but not the way we
stared. I swear kids don&#39;t make that face anymore. Anyway, so awesome.
