Dazed and Confused is great, and depending on the school, very true.
It's about the last day of school for high school kids, and
transitioning junior high students in 1976.<br /><br />The movie mostly follows the night of high schooler Randall 'Pink'
Floyd, and junior high kid Mitch Kramer. Mitch learns to have fun, and
Pink learns to live. Both very likable characters. Good, fun, acting
comes from Matthew McConaughey who plays David Wooderson, a creepy
older guy who hangs out with high school kids. I also liked Ben
Affleck's character, O'Bannion, because I know people like him. I also
liked Mitch, because I can relate to him in a lot of ways. Acting all
around was above average.<br /><br />Overall I loved the movie and suggest you see it right away. Seems to
me some people could learn a bit from it.
