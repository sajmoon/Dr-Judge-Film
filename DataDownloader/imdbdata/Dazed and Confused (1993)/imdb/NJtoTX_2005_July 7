The film was on my must-see list for so long. The DVD traveled home
with me from the library countless times, only to be returned unwatched
with fines. But I knew that the director of such terrific films as
Before Sunrise and Waking Life couldn't produce a dud. At the very
least, it would have inspiring dialog and interesting characters.<br /><br />But I saw nothing of Linklater's touch in D &amp; C (it had about the same
appeal as watching an abortion). It could have been directed by whoever
did Revenge of the Nerds or countless other films celebrating
high-school cruelty, initiations, hazing, abuse, and the wonderfully
brutal rites of organized humiliation. The fact that it rings so true
for my fellow Texans is a sad indictment of their pus-infected home
towns. Their laughter merely suggests that they survived, and thus can
enjoy watching it all happen again to others.
