Dazed and Confused is the most frustrating piece of art for a fellow
filmmaker to watch  Never before has a film actually achieved every single
goal it set out to achieve.  This film is perfection and its perfection is
masked by what appears to be less than lofty aspirations.  Though a
nostalgia piece, this film is quite timeless...depicting with frightening
accuracy the trials of youth, the sharp age divisions within youth, and the
inner-workings of this social structure.  Linklater makes it clear that
despite the angst, it is a time all of us will strive to regain as we fall
further down the disenfranchised road.
