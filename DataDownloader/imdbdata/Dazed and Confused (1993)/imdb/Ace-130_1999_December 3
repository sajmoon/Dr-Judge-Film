1999_December 3 

The IMDb has a top 250 list. I'm sure that is known by many. But what is
not
known, is that Dazed &amp; Confused owns an invisible spot which is unseen to
the human eye. It far exceeds &quot;The Godfather&quot; (another 10) by far. Watch
the
movie (if you haven't already) and then look at the top 250 list again.
THERE! Do you see it? It is right there! Better than &quot;The
Godfather&quot;!!<br /><br />Every movie has a flaw. It may be too long, too boring, too sad, too
violent, too scantily-clad, too corny, too immature, too old or it could
even be, &quot;ohh...that bad word: a Bomb&quot; at the box-office. Dazed &amp; Confused
is the first movie ever to have absolutely nothing wrong with it.<br /><br />Upon several thousand viewings I have come to know this<br /><br />Not a movie! A piece of culture and history.
I love it all and you all.
