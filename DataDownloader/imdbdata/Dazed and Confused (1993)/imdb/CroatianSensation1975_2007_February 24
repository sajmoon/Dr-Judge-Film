&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is a great period piece set in the 1970&#39;s. The
story revolves around Randall &quot;Pink&quot; Floyd and his friends. On the last
day of school in 1976, they set out to party and, unknown to them, a
journey of self discovery.<br /><br />A great comedy, with laugh out loud antics! Although I went to high
school from 89-93, I can still relate to this film. A lot of the antics
in this movie, as well as the characters, remind me of my days growing
up.<br /><br />A great cast of relative unknown actors (at the time) are in this film.
We have a young Ben Affleck, Milla Jovovich, and Matthew McConaughey.<br /><br />Also we have an awesome soundtrack of 70&#39;s music from the likes of
Black Sabbath, Ted Nugent, Kiss, Black Oak Arkansas, War and many, many
more! I highly recommend this film to any fan of comedies. Great fun,
and great nostalgia! I&#39;m sure everyone can relate to this film! Should
not be missed! 9/10
