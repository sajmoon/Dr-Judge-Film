At one time or another, a movie is made about every generation. Dazed
and Confused is for the survivors of the 1970s: that group of Americans
who came of age when bellbottoms, love beads, mantras, and marijuana
were the fashion, drinking and driving hadn&#39;t become taboo, and safe
sex was used only to avoid pregnancy or VD. As the United States
reached her bicentennial, Vietnam was over -- if the memories still
lingered -- and the short-lived disco craze was building to a frenzy
that Saturday Night Fever would both exploit and exacerbate.<br /><br />This movie begins on the last day of the 1975-76 school year, and
finishes less than twenty-four hours later. For Randy &quot;Pink&quot; Floyd
(Jason London) and his friends, it&#39;s the end of their tenure as high
school juniors, and with the final bell of the last period, they have
reached the ultimate goal for teenagers -- they are seniors. At the
local junior high school, Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins) and his cohorts
have a serious problem to consider. They are members of the incoming
freshman class and, as part of a time-honored tradition, they are about
to be totally and painfully humiliated by the new seniors.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused explores the beginning of the 1976 summer from the
varying perspectives of an unusual group of characters. Just about
every type is represented: the timid nerd looking for a way to break
out of his shell, the mindless jock, the overaged twentysomething guy
who likes hanging out with teenagers, the blond bombshell, the
stoned-out-of-his mind pot addict, and the timid newcomer.
Writer/director Richard Linklater (Slackers) is only partially
successful in his attempts to avoid making his characters into
caricatures. Most of what works with the youthful population of Dazed
and Confused is due more to the performances of a fine cast than the
writing.<br /><br />There isn&#39;t much to this picture. The storyline is minimal and the
characters&#39; personalities are as hazy as the marijuana-drenched
atmosphere. What Linklater does exceptionally well is open the door on
an era seventeen years in the past. This is 1976, from the music and
cars (which combined cost a huge chunk of the $6 million budget), to
the people and their attitudes. You&#39;d have to climb into a time machine
to get a better view.<br /><br />Comparisons with American Graffiti are warranted, remembering, of
course, that this is the next generation. Both have similar aims, but
while Graffiti&#39;s plot may have been no less insignificant than that of
Dazed and Confused, its characters are better defined. At times,
Linklater seems too wrapped up in getting everything right about the
time period. While the directors of both films care about their
protagonists, George Lucas does a better job of transferring that
feeling to the audience.<br /><br />The cast is one of new or barely-recognizable names and face (Michelle
Burke, who went on to do Coneheads, is among the few who might tweak
the memory). None of the principals can have a clear memory of 1976
(unless they&#39;re a lot older than they look), yet they play their roles
like they lived through it. Most memorable of all is Wiley Wiggins&#39;
Mitch, who performs almost every scene (including one where he buys his
first six-pack) with an affecting blend of charm and realism.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused is irresponsible and politically incorrect, and
almost worth applauding on those grounds alone. Overall, however, this
is light entertainment -- nothing groundbreaking or even especially
noteworthy. This film was made to celebrate a dead culture, and those
who were part of it, or are merely curious, will find a path into the
past through it. Unfortunately, due to the weakness of the script, they
won&#39;t find anything substantial there.
