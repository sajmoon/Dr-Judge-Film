In Richard Linklater's 'Dazed and Confused' we follow a lot of teenagers.
They drive around in their cars, they drink, use drugs and go to parties. In
my opinion it is all not a big deal, may be because I am from a country
where they tolerate soft drugs and where it is not illegal to drink beer
when you are a teenager.<br /><br />That said I have to admit there was some fun in this movie. It was not
boring and there are some nice characters here, although some of them are a
little overdone. It was also fun to see actors unknown in 1993, but pretty
known now. We recognize Ben Affleck, Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren Adams, Nicky
Katt, Anthony Rapp, Milla Jovovich, Parker Posey and Matthew
McConaughey.<br /><br />I like all movies made by Richard Linklater and I think this is definitely
not his best and one of the least interesting. That it is still worth
watching says something about the director and of course the movie
itself.
