2002_March 3 

As I am writing this review I am listening to the &quot;dazed and confused&quot;
soundtrack being a great big fan of the movie that I am, I went out and
bought both editions.  Ok this movie is great, if you havent seen it...SEE
IT!!<br /><br />I remember not even hearing about this movie, I stumbled upon a book in
Barnes &amp; Noble of which I own today.  And then I rented it being only
about
10 years old.  Ever since I watched the movie it has remained my favorite
of
all time.<br /><br />The movie is very simple, not much of a plot.  Last day of school in 1976.
You know what that means...PARTY!!!  I guess movies like &quot;cant hardly
wait&quot;
and other teeny bopper movies tried to do over the years but have failed.
No this movie is not no &quot;american graffitti&quot; but it is a great movie, I
can't even begin to tell you.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful, the cast is awesome, everyone in this movie is li
ke
their first appearance (ben affleck, parker posey). The actors do a
wonderful job displaying teenagers.<br /><br />As now, I am done with high school and I haven't seen the movie in a
while,
recently, I watched it.. and it just made me think of when I finished
junior
year to senior year... and man.. it just brought back so many
memories.<br /><br />Another thing.. if you were apart of this decade..you will love the
soundtrack.. Heck I LOVE the soundtrack and im a generation
x.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: DONT MISS THIS FILM<br /><br />**** out of ****
