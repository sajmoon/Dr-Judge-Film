2010_July 1 
I have watched this film three or four times and have found it
delightful each time. Like many other reviewers, this was my time also
(class of 75&#x27;). The first interesting observation I had was on second
viewing realizing that the movie was set in Texas. I suspect many
viewers thought it was set in California. It really doesn&#x27;t matter.
This film is spot on it&#x27;s time and subject. While the music and rituals
can be quibbled with on the margins, the filmmaker has captured the
essence of what the high school experience was at that time. <br /><br />This is really not a movie about historical facts of it&#x27;s time. In
fact, once the date is established at the start of the film, there are
virtually no references to the time this movie depicts. It&#x27;s just a
slice of life at that time. Simple, true and well studied.<br /><br />Having lived this film I can tell you that most of my friends thought
we were living the decade that would have absolutely have no identity.
The music alone shows how much we underestimated that time. This little
time capsule shares all the special flavors of the 70s that younger
generations may not have a feel for.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused is a treasure of glimpses of a specific time that
also reminds all viewers that high school kids really haven&#x27;t changed
all that much!
