&#x22;Dazed and Confused&#x22; is &#x22;American Graffiti&#x22; set in the 1970s. And why
not? A movie about teenagers having a fun summer night out cruising and
getting into trouble, set to a non-stop pop soundtrack of the times...
it&#x27;s instant nostalgia and works very well.<br /><br />&#x22;Dazed and Confused&#x22; lacks the character depth of its early-1960s-set
counterpart and has even less of a coherent plot - nearly all that
happens is a bunch of teenagers have a wild night out, some are making
the transition to high school, some are making the transition away from
it. What &#x22;Dazed&#x22; lacks in conventional plot or deep characters it makes
up for with great humor and a few central characters who are very
well-realized.<br /><br />For the most part though, this movie is an idealized night from &#x22;back
in the day&#x22; caught on film. It doesn&#x27;t have to be the 1970s, the themes
in this movie are universal teenager stuff, as well they should be.
