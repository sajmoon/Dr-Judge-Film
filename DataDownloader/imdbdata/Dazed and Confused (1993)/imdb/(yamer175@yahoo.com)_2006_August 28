I&#39;m from the class of &#39;76, so I can relate. It&#39;s as if I knew many of
the characters in this film. We used to party in the woods,too. <br /><br />Some favorite scenes:<br /><br />Pre-party in bedroom, when beer delivery shows up, and the subsequent
reaction from the father. Golden hour cinematography on the city
streets.<br /><br />I noticed a production error in the scene at the liquor store-gas
station just after the mail box bowling ball window smashing. If
watched closely, one can see film crew reflections in the drivers door
as it opens. You can also see production lighting, as well on the same
side.
