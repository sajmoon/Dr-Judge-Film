I can see the appeal of this movie. It is very much an &quot;American
Graffiti&quot; for the &#39;70s. If you look just a little you can find many of
the same caricatures used by Lucas. DC is viewed by the youth of today
much as we viewed AG in our day. <br /><br />Contrary to many of the other reviewers I saw little humor in the
hazing and the wide-spread drinking and smoking weed. That is not to
say that there were not funny moments and lines, because there were
quite a few; Slater&#39;s &quot;knowledge&quot; of history particularly hilarious.
Who knew that Martha Washington grew weed - apparently by the bushel!<br /><br />I also found it interesting the number of reviewers that have watched
this movie and assert that this &quot;exactly&quot; their experience during the
&#39;70s. Mine was far from it. Growing up in a small N. California town
(not far from AG&#39;s inspiration - Modesto) much of what was depicted did
not occur or at least not to the extreme shown. Parents cared what time
their children came home, what they&#39;d been up to and if they&#39;d been
drinking/smoking. That is not to say that there wasn&#39;t any
drinking/smoking - it was just on lower level and not nearly as
wide-spread as depicted.<br /><br />And many of the &quot;pranks&quot; shown in the movie occurred but were easily
remedied in the real world. My father&#39;s mail box was hit only once.
It&#39;s concrete-filled replacement collected broken bats for years
afterward. And our equivalent of paddling was promptly discontinued
when a freshman stabbed his assaulting senior with a knife. Problem
solved.<br /><br />But this is the way with movies. A narrow reality is shown often with
few if any consequences for actions. Those not having lived in the time
view it and get nostalgic over what they &quot;missed out on.&quot; In reality
the only thing they missed out on was a figment of someone&#39;s
imagination. <br /><br />One thing particularly note worthy of this movie is the quality of
acting. I don&#39;t think that there was a bad performance in the lot.
Perhaps some could have been better but none were bad. And others have
noted, the music selections were great. Now there is a reality that is
sorely missed today - the great wealth of artistic talent that was the
&#39;70s. The youth of today have no idea what a vast waste land of music
they&#39;re living through; it&#39;s a veritable desert compared to the &#39;70s.
