The best comedies don&#x27;t just entertain you and make you laugh, they
also offer a poignant glimpse into the lives of their characters, as
well as giving you something to think about afterwards. &#x22;Dazed and
Confused&#x22; does all of this and so much more. The film is breathtaking
and absorbing. Just like Robert Altman did with films such as &#x22;Short
Cuts&#x22; and &#x22;Nashville&#x22;, Richard Linklater is able to juggle so many
different characters and their arcs with relative ease, never losing
focus or slowing down for filler. The film takes place in the 70&#x27;s on
the last day of school in May of 1976. The narrative focuses on several
different teenagers and young adults from junior high, high school and
beyond. Nearly every character is given a unique personality and plenty
of depth, making it difficult for even the strongest actors in the film
to stand out, because everyone&#x27;s character arc is compelling and there
wasn&#x27;t one point in the film that made me doze off or wish was sped up,
a huge accomplishment in its own right for such an epic ensemble
comedy.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, the film is genuinely paced, but I would be amiss
if I didn&#x27;t mention how great the cast performs. This film has one of
the best ensemble casts for a film from the 90&#x27;s, with many
recognizable names, and even some unknown ones that make huge
impressions in their roles. I don&#x27;t want to single just a few people
out because I felt that everyone performed admirably. The film reflects
American society as a whole with subtlety and plenty of vitality, but
it never veers into preachiness and doesn&#x27;t have one specific message,
it&#x27;s simply life. We get to watch these characters live and learn over
the course of a single night. Some characters learn the harsh reality
of life and some just have the time of their lives without realizing
that they might not be able to have this much fun again soon enough.<br /><br />I wish more period music was used, but I guess it was a good idea to
not use too many popular songs, because then that would distract a lot
of viewers from what&#x27;s really going on because those songs would be
ringing in their heads and signaling nostalgic feelings, which is good,
but the film&#x27;s characters demand your attention. In the midst of great
character development and thought provoking themes, the film is
hilarious and downright witty. I wasn&#x27;t born int he 70&#x27;s, but I got all
the little jokes and references, and despite the characters talking
differently than they did in the time I grew up, I instantly clicked
with them and felt like I was hanging out with these people on one long
day. I rarely give comedies this much praise, especially youth
comedies, but &#x22;Dazed and Confused&#x22; isn&#x27;t anything less than a
masterpiece. It speaks directly to viewers of all ages and still
retains the freshness it brought to the table when it came out, and
it&#x27;s aged beyond gracefully. It&#x27;s one of the definitive period pieces
and comedies out there.
