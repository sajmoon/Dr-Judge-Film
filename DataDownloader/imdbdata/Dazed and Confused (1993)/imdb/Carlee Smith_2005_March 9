I am a freshman at Huntsville High (HHS) the people in the movie were
upset because they used their real names. Everyone that I go to school
with has no personal problems with it. We've all seen it and apparently
we found it funny and stupid. Our school runs a little low on hot guys
so we found the actors amazing in this movie since we all know the guys
here. Like everybody else here they are not to be harsh ugly coon-asses
or rednecks. We would be so thrilled if Ben Affleck went to school at
HHS. My Aunt who knows the men very well knows this is actually pretty
close to the truth and rented the movie just for thrills. Dazed and
Confused will keep little Huntsville, Texas famous for a while. All you
people who read this better not forget the power Huntsville has with
its 11 prisons and stupid memories.Go Huntsville Hornets!!!!!
