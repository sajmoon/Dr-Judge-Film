Ah.. Dazed and Confused.   The title of this film does not do it
justice.   Although there is copious amounts of beer drinking and drug
taking, there is an intelligent and good natured core that runs through.
The teens during all the fun are really reflecting.   From the quarterback
who is pressured to sign an &quot;anti-fun&quot; document, to the freshman who must
navigate the nuances of the social upper echelon after being
ritualistically
hammered on the ass.<br /><br />We actually get to see the realistic dynamics of highschool cliques.
There are the cool kids, the jocks, the jerks, the stoners, and the smart
guys.   But these cliques are not nations unto themselves.   The cross-over
of friends between these cliques is portrayed realistically with irony and
humor.   This is how I remembered highschool.   It was never 'the pretty
perfect students vs. the ugly drug taking hoods'.  I watch this movie and I
think, 'Hey, I knew these guys.   Hell, I was one of them.'<br /><br />The movie also spares us the usual contrived plot.   It really
doesn't need it.   We are seeing a slice of life here, a part of history,
not some lame moralistic story.   Even though the ending suggests, subtley,
that some of these 'confused' teens are on a dangerous highway, it's done
without being preachy or heavy handed.<br /><br />Dazed and Confused is the closest thing to 'American Graphitti'
today's generation has.   Although, with the current popularity of Brittany
Spears and drug testing, this sadly may no longer be the
case.<br /><br />And for all those people who found their mailboxes busted, I truly
apologize.
