I had seen bits and pieces of Dazed on USA and other cable networks
before,
but had never seen the entire movie until lately.  I have to say this is
one
of my
favorite movies ever, right up there with Pulp Fiction and American
Beauty.
It's
just a laid back, easy movie to watch.  It's one of those movies you
could
watch
over and over and it would still be cool.  The thing I liked so much
about
this
movie is that it's so real.  I was in school in the 90's but a lot of it
seemed very
much the same.  For almost every character in that movie I can think of
someone
from my small town high school that was just like that.  Although we
didn't
ever
do any hazing like in the movie, about everything else was accurate.
Everyone
would just hop in their cars on Friday nights and drive around town
looking
for a
party or keg somewhere, and usually nothing exciting ever happened.
There
were the different groups just like in the movie.  The intellectuals, the
pot heads,
the jocks, the freshmen guys who thought they ran the show.  Especially
accurate is the one guy who graduated a few years ago but still hangs out
with
the high schoolers.  I also like this movie because it flows so well.
You
don't
have a big plot, no real story at all even.  Things just happen and you
go
with it.
Very cool movie.
