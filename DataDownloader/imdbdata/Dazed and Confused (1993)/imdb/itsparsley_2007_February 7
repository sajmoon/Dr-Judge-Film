Dazed and Confused is a classic &quot;stoner&quot; comedy but at the same time is
a classic comedy. It&#39;s one of those films that doesn&#39;t get lopped into
just the Cheech &amp; Chongs and Fridays but branches out to an entirely
new audience that can really appreciate it. I love watching this movie
and then thinking to myself how far Richard Linklater has come since.
He&#39;s still a well respected director who can lure big actors into his
independent masterpieces. After watching Dazed and Confused one may
often want to get in a time machine and travel back to the 70&#39;s, since
we can&#39;t do this we repeat a viewing. The remarkable thing about this
movie is that each time you watch it it actually gets better. You
become more familiar with the characters, and suddenly you&#39;re
incredibly comfortable with them. After a certain point it&#39;s as if
you&#39;re hanging out with the characters you know them so well. Linklater
is a fantastic director who always has amazing characters, Dazed and
Confused does not disappoint.
