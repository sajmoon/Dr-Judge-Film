Dazed and Confused finds meaning in the familiar scene of High School
madness. The meaning is not lost on the straightest of viewers, yet it
also extends to the American counterculture of the time period. Cheers
to a worth wile flick. Personally, its best with a brew or two.<br /><br />If you are looking for a lighthearted romp or something in the
background for that casual evening of beer and friends, this will fit
the bill. Don&#39;t peer too far into this one and its more rewarding. <br /><br />Several drinking games (and less legal substance games) have been
contrived for this film and may improve your experience. Watch at your
own risk as lethal doses of fun may ensue.
