This movie, in my opinion, counts a s timeless on multiple levels.
Regardless of your age when watching this film or whether or not you
were alive during 1976 you feel a sense of relationship to the
characters. Despite not being born until 7 after this film takes place,
I can really connect with its message throughout. There is a lot more
to this movie than just drugs and alcohol, its about acceptance and
being happy with the person you are and doing what makes you happy.
This is a film everybody should watch at least once in their lifetime.
The characters in this movie, especially Pink Floyd are not faced
merely with battles against society but also against themselves in the
sense of finding who they want to be. I think D&amp;C captures an accurate
portrait of teenage life and all of the confusion, temptation, fear,
and pressure that go right along with it. Linklater really got it
right, which is not a surprise, by not just making this strictly a
stoner mover but a portrait of Americana. D&amp;C is a lot more than a
movie, its a proud statement for being the people we all want to be,
not who we are told to be.
