1999_May 25 

Boy, did I feel messed up after watching this!  Seriously!  There is no
plot
or point to this movie.  Just drugs, sex, rock &amp; roll, and gettin' loaded!
I was drinking Tequila with my brother and his friends while I watched it,
so I felt even more, well, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;.  The movie is basically
just one big party that takes up the 2 hours of film.  It realistically
recaptures the essence and memories of high school teens in the 70's.
However, watching it is not an easy task.  It's very funny, but it's
loaded
with beer and drugs.  And
some scenes are tough to watch, because it reminds us of how at one point
in
our lives, we all got our a**es pounded in with a paddle by the older
kids.
That's life!  But hey, life can be cool, hip, and drugged up sometimes,
like
the time this movie took place.  It happens to us at one point in our
lives.
This movie is well constructed, and very funny at times.  However, don't
think you will come out of this movie feeling halfway normal and sober.
