So I revisited 1993&#x27;s cult classic &#x22;dazed and Confused&#x22;, at the local
artsy film house. It was a great night they had a costume contest,
which we won, well we were the only one&#x27;s who apparently decided to
come in costume, but still we won. They even sold PBR&#x27;s during the
movie so that made things that much better. So is this movie a classic,
I say alright alright. This is a cult classic more geared towards the
stoner crowd of which I am a proud member. What affirmed for me the
notion that this movie is a cult classic is the overwhelming abundance
of people (including me) who were saying the lines of the movie out
loud in the theater. The fact that so many people remembered so many
great lines I think says it all. And that is one of the great things
about this movie the story and the dialog in particular. The great cult
film maker Richard Linklater, didn&#x27;t just develop fascinating
characters, he gave them many many many memorable things to say. This
movie is also nostalgic, for even though it takes place in the 70&#x27;s, I
identified with the whole suburban growing up and making the transition
from middle school to high school and going from underclassman to the
all powerful senior class thing (that was a mouth full). I also
identified with a lot of what these characters did to have fun when
they were young and stupid. Look, I don&#x27;t know if this movie is for
everyone, as I said it is a stoner cult classic, but Richard Linklater
has given us not just fun movies to watch like this and school of rock,
but a pair of great romance movies in before sunrise and before sunset,
some really deep philosophical vehicles, in slacker and waking life,
and last but not least the imaginative &#x22;a scanner darkly&#x22; which
showcases the very beautiful filming technique known as interpolated
rotoscoping, which Linlater was the first to utilize for an entire
film. In addition to all this, this film launched the careers of actors
like Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck. Look the point of all this
is, this is not just a great film, it was made by one of today&#x27;s most
interesting film directors, and gives a look at budding stardom. So in
other words, no matter what your personal tastes, there is almost no
reason not to at least check out this gem. You may even find yourself
someday watching it again and saying the lines with glee yourself. if
