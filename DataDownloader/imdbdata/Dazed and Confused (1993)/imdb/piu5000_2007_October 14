Dazed and Confused is a classic teen film depicting life as a high
schooler. Everything about the movie makes it such a classic. The
actors were all chosen superbly and act just like you&#39;d find high
schoolers in real life. The storyline is also well thought out and
never gets boring. The mixture of drama and comedy provide for a well
rounded movie. Once you see it, you will fall in love with the way the
story progresses and takes you on a trip through the lives of these
young adults in the 70&#39;s. All of the cars and scenery are also very
accurate. The movie is extremely funny and enjoyable. Even adults can
watch this movie and remember the days when they were in school.
Excellent movie!
