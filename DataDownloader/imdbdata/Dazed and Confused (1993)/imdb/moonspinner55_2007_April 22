Cast of then-unknowns are quite convincing as high schools grads and
under-grads interacting one day and night in suburban America, May
1976. Despite the film&#39;s inherent nostalgia factor (groovy lingo,
far-out fashions, funky soundtrack), the movie never lapses into campy
shtick, though it does swing wildly between comedy and drama, and
writer-director Richard Linklater shows many of these people absolutely
no mercy (is the cruelty justified by the comedic undermining? Some may
say yes, but I found it off-putting). Linklater thankfully does not try
to emulate other films in this genre (specifically &quot;American Graffiti&quot;
and &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;), yet the fact this isn&#39;t a retread
doesn&#39;t make it less sour. It&#39;s too bad the characters aren&#39;t allowed
to take shape or blossom, instead becoming recognizable stock-figures
in a &#39;70&#39;s vacuum (then again, maybe that was Linklater&#39;s point).
Terrific detail and a knowing sense of the period make it just
tolerable. ** from ****
