can someone explain what&#x27;s the purpose of this movie? it actually has
no meaning at all!! it doesn&#x27;t say anything, doesn&#x27;t show anything new,
just a bunch of guys talking and talking and talking wasting their time
and the viewers as well. u sit and wait for something to be happening
but guess what..? nothing almost does! this film is absolutely a waste
of time, anybody can smoke a leaf and start talking nonsense for no
reason or otherwise, do something with it or .. about it.<br /><br />this movie doesn&#x27;t tell any story, seams to have no plot, just give
some guys a joint and let them talk forever, film that and release. the
only thing that might be nice about it is, that there are some nice
looking girls in it, other than that, it&#x27;s just like watching a boring
old T.V show. the guys are quite nice but again, there is no sense in
it, nothing to it, just like watching someone lay on his back and turn
over for an hour or so, if u like this sort of meaningless behavior,
something that tries to show that there is a meaning to meaningless
deeds, go on, you might like it, as many did. otherwise, it&#x27;s a waste
of u&#x27;r time and above that, absolutely useless!
