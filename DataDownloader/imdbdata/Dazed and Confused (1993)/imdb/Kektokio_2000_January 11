This film is watchable, but not all that good. I knew what I was in for when
I rented this film. I really enjoyed the film &quot;SubUrbia&quot;, and I was
expecting this would be similar.. and it is, it just didn't appeal to me
much. I'm sure teenage drug pushers would enjoy this more than I did. But I
probably would have liked it more if it didn't have the drug use and
references.
