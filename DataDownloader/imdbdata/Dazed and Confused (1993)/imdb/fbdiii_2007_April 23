I love Dazed and Confused for two reasons; 1. One of the best examples
of a Hollywood film that actually gets a time and place not just
correct, but DEAD ON PERFECT! 2. Reminds me of a time and place very
near and dear to my heart! The state of Texas in my youth! <br /><br />I grew up in Texas in &#39;70&#39;s and &#39;80&#39;s and watching this movie reminds
me of my big sister and her friends at Killeen High School in Central
Texas. (about 60 miles north of Austin, where the film is set.)
Everything from the kids hanging out by their Pick-up trucks in the
parking lot of school, to the Freshmen initiations, to the beer keg
party out in the middle of nowhere is SOOOO High School in Texas at
that time. I especially love the soundtrack since it reminds me of how
my big sister introduced me to &quot;cool rock &amp; roll&quot; ala &quot;Almost Famous.&quot; <br /><br />Change the music and clothes and it was pretty much the same when I
entered High School four years later in 1980. Although the drug use in
the early &#39;80&#39;s was kept more on the &quot;down-low&quot; in my High School
years. I think that had more to do with the &#39;80&#39;s evolving from the
&#39;70&#39;s than a reduction in toking! I was a football player, so there
weren&#39;t too many &quot;Heads&quot; in my clique, but we did drink some serious
beer!!! <br /><br />I really feel sorry for kids today who don&#39;t have the opportunity to
have the kind of fun I had with my friends and my sister had with hers.
I think the PC, alcohol free, straight edge life today&#39;s kids are
expected to live is completely unrealistic. I really feel that the
healthy social life I had as a High School kid helped me develop into a
well rounded adult. I KNOW that learning to drink beer in HS made sure
that I didn&#39;t make a fool out of myself in College and as a young
adult. All that partying did nothing to adversely effect my development
or my sister&#39;s. We both went to college and have successful
professional careers as do most of the people we went to HS and College
with.<br /><br />I think kids today are more likely to use drugs BECAUSE they are denied
beer at that age, not the opposite. Teenagers like to experiment; with
sex, with alcohol and with drugs. I know if I had my choice I would
rather have my kids experiment with beer and a little weed instead of
coke, crystal meth, etc.
