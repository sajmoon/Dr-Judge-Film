There's a little story to my review.....the other day I stumbled across
&quot;Slacker&quot; in my university library and decided to rent it out (for
educational purposes, of course ;-) ), on the back it said it was
directed by the same person who directed &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, so I had
a quick look to see if the library stocked that too. Luckily for me it
did! While I was watching D+C I realised that I had seen it before, but
none the less i'm still glad I took the time out to watch it again, it
was worth every second. It provides a lot of laughs, but its not as
slap-stick as say &quot;American Pie&quot;. I wasn't born in the 70's but I sense
its authenticity, I think no matter what era you grew up in (im more of
a 90's child) you should be able to appreciate/relate to what the kids
in this flick think/do/see! Great film, will be looking out for more of
Richard Linklater's work. P.S. I knew that was Renee!!
