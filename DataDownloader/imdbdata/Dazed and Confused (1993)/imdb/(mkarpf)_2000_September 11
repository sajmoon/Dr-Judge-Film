2000_September 11 

Beside the fact, that i was only 1 in '76 (and that i'm from germany), i
would have loved it to be in that period of time. When i saw the film, i
enjoyed the music, the scenes and the atmosphere of the film. No great
plot,
but that's not the point of the film... it shows just one day in the life
of
some young people who were forced to go into a life which is more complex
then that, that they have before and they cheer the life they leave
behind.
