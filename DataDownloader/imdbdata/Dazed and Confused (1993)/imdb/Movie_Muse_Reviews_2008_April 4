The 1950s has &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and now the 1970s has &quot;Dazed and
Confused.&quot; Both are well-developed depictions of life in America during
those decades with a focus around high school, growing up and making
important decisions about what to do and how to live life. Both also
gather a killer soundtrack from each decade and the result is more
about evoking nostalgia and showing those too young to know what life
was like.<br /><br />Director and writer Richard Linklater does good work with this film
about high schoolers (mostly incoming seniors) on the last day of
school. He&#39;s written characters that are fun and easy to identify (by
stereotype sometimes) and identify with. The plot is just one giant
misadventure involving alcohol, marijuana, high school hazing and a
variety of &quot;rebellious&quot; activity. It never settles comfortably around
one character, giving you enough to get to know them and be interested
in what happens to them, but not enough to truly understand them or
care about them. Linklater&#39;s focus appears to be showing the many ways
that teens handled life and how they felt about it in 1976 through
mishaps and comedic moments.<br /><br />The cast is a lot of fun, especially because a lot of actors when they
were a bit younger appear in the film: Ben Affleck, Matthew
McCounaughy, Parker Posey, Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren Adams (&quot;Big
Daddy&quot;), Anthony Rapp (&quot;RENT&quot;) and even more. Nobody&#39;s a show stealer,
but that&#39;s because the film isn&#39;t designed that way.<br /><br />&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is just fun. At the very least the soundtrack will
have you rocking out a bit. There&#39;s no slapstick, gut-wrenching humor,
you just laugh and enjoy. There&#39;s nothing moving about the movie, but
you enjoy the characters and what happens to them. It&#39;s a very sound
movie (no pun intended, but it work I guess) in that it&#39;s just well put
together. It&#39;s not bad at all; if you don&#39;t like it it&#39;s probably
because you wanted more from it.
