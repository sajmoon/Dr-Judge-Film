&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, which takes place during the 70s, was one of the
best movies of the 90s. It really is phenomenal how much talent was in
this ensemble; if you want to see Adam Goldberg, Matthew Mcconaughey,
Milla Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams, Parker Posey, or an almost
completely unrecognizable Ben Affleck (playing the sort of role he
would almost never play again, an a**hole) before they were stars, look
no further. And of course this was an early movie for director Richard
Linklater, who had made the relatively unknown &quot;Slackers&quot; previously
and who would go on to make &quot;School of Rock&quot;, which was almost as good
as &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;.<br /><br />Taking place on the last day of school in a small suburban town, &quot;Dazed
and Confused&quot; is a brilliant ensemble piece rivaling anything done by
Robert Altman that covers the broadest spectrum of teenagers
imaginable. We see the nerds, the potheads, the jocks, and the
cheerleaders, as well as the incoming freshmen, as they celebrate the
beginning of summer. Some celebrate less than others, of course;
freshman hazing is a big part of the movie, both male and female. The
dialogue is fresh and unexpected; lines about George Washington's
proclivity for marijuana, why you just gotta love high school girls (&quot;I
get older, they stay the same age&quot;, as McConaughey's character says),
and the herd mentality when a fight breaks out demonstrate how
all-over-the-map the dialogue can be, and it's always affecting and
usually quite funny. <br /><br />Of course, it's the acting and the characters that really steal the
movie, and it really is amazing how many people in this movie went on
to bigger things. As I said before, Affleck was the most surprising,
but Mcconaughey had the most memorable role as an older dude who can't
seem to let go of his youth, a slick slimeball who chases after
under-age jail bait. And he has never been funnier or better than he
was in this. Eventually, his character will wake up and the kids aren't
going to want to hang out with him and the girls aren't going to want
to sleep with him anymore, and he's going to have a rude awakening. But
for the time being, he's all macho cool swagger, and Mcconaughey pulled
off the part perfectly. Parker Posey is also excellent, playing a
senior bitch (but only because she's &quot;supposed&quot; to be) unleashing a
humiliating hazing on the incoming freshman girls.<br /><br />You have to give props to the writing. It's not a long movie, but it
covers so much ground that it feels big. At one point, a character says
that the 70s obviously suck. That may have been, but it's never looked
cooler than it did in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. And the soundtrack must be
mentioned too. The 70s was a decade full of musical highs and lows, and
thankfully the soundtrack highlights the highs while ignoring the lows,
and we have songs by Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Dr. John, War, and other
seminal 70s rock figures (curiously missing: &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; by
Led Zeppelin, but that's forgivable). Brilliant; there's not a single
clunker, and it adds to the free, easygoing atmosphere of the movie.
&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is quite possibly the best &quot;teen movie&quot; ever made,
and, from the point of view of someone who grew up in the 80s anyway,
the best movie about the 70s ever made.
