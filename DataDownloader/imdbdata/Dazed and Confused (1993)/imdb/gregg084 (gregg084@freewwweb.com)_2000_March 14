I've probably seen this film 5 or 6 times.  It never seems to get tiring.
For anyone that lived through the 70's, or anyone that was ever a teen,
this
film should be seen. Shamelessly underrated, Linklater has created a
nostalgic trip back to when life was all about good times, good friends,
and
good bud. Not a whole lot of plot here but who cares? See it, enjoy it,
then
see it again.
