This movie has got to be the most quotable ever! Linklater sure had his
finger on the pulse of the mid-70s. What a trip! I can (and have) watch
this
movie again and again. Truly hilarious. The language, outfits, cars,
feeling
of the mid-west (where high school football is ALWAYS the lead story on
the
news), are all perfect.
