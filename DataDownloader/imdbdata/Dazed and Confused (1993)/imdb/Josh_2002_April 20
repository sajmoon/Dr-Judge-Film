A great movie in the tradition of American Graffiti.  Dazed and Confused
takes place on the last day of school as juniors become seniors in 1970s
Texas.  The greatest thing about the movie is the pure characterization -
you really get to KNOW the characters as the movie unfolds.  This is a
movie
that MUST be viewed more than once to catch all the fine details that
Richard Linklater has included to make this such a special film.<br /><br />Featuring a fine ensemble cast that went on to become very big stars, the
film also has two great soundtracks with all the great music used in the
film.  One can watch over and over again without losing interest - Dazed
and
Confused is simply a great movie!
