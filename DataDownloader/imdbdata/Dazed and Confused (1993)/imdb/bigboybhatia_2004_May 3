I saw this movie shortly after it came out.  I was 16 at the time, and it
was interested seeing people
in the film who were about my age, 20 years earlier.  You could
definitely
tell this film was geared towards people who where in their teens
in
the mid-70's, and who have been in their mid-thirties when the
film
came out.  They also released not one but two excellent
soundtracks
featuring music of the era. I wouldn't be surprised if the
filmmakers
made more off the soundtracks than the movie.
The movie definitely is attempting to create a sense of
nostalgia.
The average viewer who is not from that era will likely find
the
movie slow and dull.  Watch to see early appearances by several
future
stars - Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Matthew McConaughey.
This is not an out-and-out comedy.  There is no slapstick or
gross-out
humour that we typically see in teen films.
Not bad. 7/10
