&quot;No, not on me, man.&quot; 
This movie is great. Many people tell, that they were disappointed because
there was no plot in this movie. But how could you give this movie a plot.
The persons who wrote bad comments on this movie haven't registered that the
last day of highschool, the last day of beeing a kid couldn't and shouldn't
be anything else than drinking, tokin' some reefer and just hanging out. The
interesting things about this movie are the persons and their characters and
how even the intelligent folks want to have party, because they recognised
they maybe could have missed something in their youth: &quot;Look, we need some
alcohol.&quot; <br /><br />On the other hand the 'cool' kids that have their partys, drugs and alcohol
every day spend their time on thinking about their future, what they could
have done better. In the end Pink said that sentence I will always
remember:
&quot;If this is the best time of my life, remind me to kill
myself.&quot;
Watch this movie more than just one time.
I gave it 10 out of 10
