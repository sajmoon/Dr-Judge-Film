2008_May 9 
I&#39;ve seen this movie 10+ times. Mainly on the Criterion DVD, which I
highly recommend. Like many who love it, I&#39;m old &amp; it reflects my
&quot;sense&quot; of the era, but not my personal experiences. Linklater, with a
one indie film track record, got studio money and had to fight very
hard to get his vision and words on the screen. He and his casting
director had an eye for talent, as many have pointed out. For me, the
key to appreciating this is in the &quot;making of&quot; feature on the DVD. More
than most, it tells a great story of why it is worth it to fight for
your vision, and what you have to be willing to lose in the process.
Several &quot;reviewers&quot; here say this movie lacks a plot. IMHO, this movie
is far closer to &quot;reality&quot; than any of the &quot;reality&quot; shows on TV that
play out like game shows. This movie is closer to being a &quot;time
machine&quot; without being a documentary. For that same reason, I don&#39;t
think it&#39;s a comedy. I never laugh at it. The dialog is simply &quot;real&quot;
and we are sitting in the time machine watching what happened at this
place and time. So, kudos to the writer/director, and the cast who is
able to bring his words seamlessly to life. In 2008, when studios make
the most money from turning comic books into movies, it seems unlikely
that we will ever see the like of this film again. But we are so lucky
that, for 90 minutes, we can forget about what a mess our generation
has made of things -- geez, I hope it&#39;s not because our leaders spent
their youth getting stoned instead of actually learning things in
school!!
