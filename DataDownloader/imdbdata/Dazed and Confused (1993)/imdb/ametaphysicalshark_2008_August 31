If this really is what high school was like in 1976 I sure am glad I
didn&#39;t go to high school at the time. What a pathetic bunch of dumb
half-wits, fools, idiots, scumbags, and annoying wimps the characters
in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; are. Yes, I have just committed cinematic
blasphemy, although I&#39;m not sure why this movie is so respected and
loved. There&#39;s a great soundtrack and then there&#39;s... um... I think
that&#39;s pretty much it. I guess I just have to accept that I&#39;ll never
like Linklater&#39;s writing or characters outside of &quot;Tape&quot; and &quot;The
School of Rock&quot;. Not much of a director either, really. I don&#39;t need to
sympathize with characters or relate to situations to enjoy movies, but
when a movie consists of nearly two hours of half-assed attempts at
themes, one-dimensional and annoying characters (oh wait, they&#39;re not
one-dimensional because Linklater gives them one or two lines that
reveal them to be more human. I guess I&#39;m too dumb for his amazing
subtlety), it gets genuinely hard to sit through.<br /><br />It&#39;s great that people enjoy this nonsense. I&#39;ll stick to my &quot;Freaks
and Geeks&quot; DVD&#39;s, thank you, or just that American classic which George
Lucas gave us.<br /><br />3/10
