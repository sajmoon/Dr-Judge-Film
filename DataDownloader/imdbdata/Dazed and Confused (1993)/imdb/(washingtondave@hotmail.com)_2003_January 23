When I first saw this movie, my first response was &quot;This is Ocala 1985&quot;. I
grew up in Ocala, Fl. during the mid 80's, which is kind of like growing up
in a normal town in the mid 70's. For fun(b/c there was nothing else to do)
the kids at my high school would somehow get a hold of beer and/or liquor
and/or Boon's farm wine and go out in the middle of the woods and get drunk.
We would listen to Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and other 'classic'
rock. There would always be a fight. So if you grew up in your typical small
American town, rent this movie(it'd be a lot cooler if you did) and I
promise that you will relate to at least one character.
