Well, what can I say, are you cool man? Like how?
It&acute;s the most fab film I&acute;ve ever seen and I love it to
death.
Slater is sooo cool, Mitch is sooo cute, and Wooderson&acute;s sooo sexy! And
their clothes are the coolest, I just wanna live in the 70&acute;s everytime I
watch it! Their party seems really awesome, and I just wish I could hop into
the TV and join them!<br /><br />Anyone who feels the same could mail me:
