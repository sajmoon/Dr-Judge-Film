This is one of those movies that you can watch 1,000 times and still be
entertained. It&#x27;s great when you are young and thinking about what
highschool might be like (even though highschool today is a lot
different then it was back then), but it also is good to watch and
think back to your own highschool days. So basically this movie is
perfect no matter what age you are. You&#x27;ll be quoting this movie right
after you watch it and years to come after that. Doesn&#x27;t get a perfect
rating because I don&#x27;t really like the lead in it. He&#x27;s okay, but looks
like a girl that I know....and since he&#x27;s a dude it&#x27;s kind of off
putting.
