Someone else said it - and it&#39;s true: This is our American Graffiti.
This is the night I became a senior too (a week after this movie&#39;s
set)... I&#39;d been to see Paul McCartney &amp; Wings at the brand new Seattle
Kingdome the night before; couldn&#39;t hear a thing the whole next day.
Such a lame time, in terms of big-stakes issues, political upheaval -
OK, we had a gas shortage. And that&#39;s a lot of the story of the film.
Everyone&#39;s trying to find something to believe in. <br /><br />For all the TV shows and movies that do half-baked attempts to recreate
period, here&#39;s one that nails it. The clothes, the hair, the makeup,
the music, the cars, right down to the attitude of each character -
spooky good. The seniors act like seniors; the freshmen act like
freshmen... they make that year or two or three difference in age
absolutely clear in the briefest bits of dialog and visuals. Of course,
a great collection of stars-to-be. McConaughey is especially terrific
here.
