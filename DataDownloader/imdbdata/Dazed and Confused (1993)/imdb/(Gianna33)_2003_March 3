I have seen this movie literally tens of times.  That is an awful lot for
me
- once is usually enough!  Hilarious comedy about high schoolers in the
'70's.  The movie takes place in 24 hours, from the morning of the last
day
of school through the nighttime celebration that ensues.<br /><br />Don't expect a serious film here, anyone who is tremendously critical of
the
film obviously was.  This is a lighthearted comedy.  There are some great
one-liners (many of them provided by Matthew McConaughey).<br /><br />The creators took a fair stab at the politics of high school. It is also
fun
to see so many rising stars... Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Joey Lauren
Adams,
&amp; Matthew McConaughey to name a few. Definitely worth watching at least
once!
