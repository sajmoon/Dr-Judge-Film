Everything in this movie is spot-on for this 1977 high school graduate.
I just want to know who moved my high school from Charleston, SC to
Texas! As others have remarked, the soundtrack is remarkable in that it
covers the stuff we listened to. I will vouch for the fact that sex was
easy to get, beer was slightly more difficult, and weed was a little
harder, but widely available during those times. There are three
portrayals/scenes that hit home with me -- The portrayal of the
football coaches as conservative Neanderthals, the threat of deadly
violence following a random act of senseless vandalism (such really
happened to me and my &quot;buds&quot;) and the whole discussion of exactly why
George Washington was growing hemp at Mount Vernon. I truly love this
gem.
