High school students celebrating their last day of school.  This movie
depicts high school the way people think it must have been in 1976.  The
best thing is that every group is represented.  The &quot;cool group&quot;, the
freshmen, the nerds, and all of course the jocks.  The best thing about this
movie is that there is a link between all three of the groups, which is
often true in real life.  The character of Randall &quot;Pink&quot; Floyd represents
that jock who wants to stand up for his own beliefs rather than conform just
to be a part of the football team.  This movie continues in a funny,
enlightening way ushering us through each scene with an awesome soundtrack.  I
think everyone should see the movie.
