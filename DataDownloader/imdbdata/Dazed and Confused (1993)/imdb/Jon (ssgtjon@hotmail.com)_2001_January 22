      The 80's produced some of the goofiest teen flicks (Sixteen Candles,
Weird Science), the 90's produced hardly any except for
the
latter half. I went to see this movie mainly for the fact that it was filmed
in Austin, where I grew up, even though it was supposedly set in a small
town, but Texas' small towns are anything but sophisticated,
like most of these kids were. I'm sure every character in the film was one
most anybody could relate to in their high school days; for some strange
reason, the ones I related to best were the ones that had the two guys and
red-haired girl, since I never was the party animal type and always a
thinker, even though they were classified as &quot;geeks', like
many of the more subdued and mild-mannered teens tend to be thought of as. I
also found myself identifying with Matthew McConaughey's 20-something
character who still hangs onto his high school years and generally has no
long term goals, so much like Paul LeMat's John in American Graffiti, only
not so stoic and introspective. I consider this an overall great film with
basically no plot to speak of, just a glimpse into the lives of Texas teens
in the 70's. Also, I went to lunch frequently at that Top Notch hamburger
joint they hang out at back when I was in high school.
