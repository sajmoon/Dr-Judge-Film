Dazed and Confused is great fun. This movie truly takes you back to your
teen years and shows you how trivial your life is at this age, yet it
seems
like it is the make or break time in your life. Characters in this movie
seem to come from my life and I would recommend seeing this with some old
high school friends, you are sure to relive something.
