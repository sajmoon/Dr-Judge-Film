I found this an excellent movie. I recommend it to teenagers or people who
grew up in the 70's. Its the story of the last day of school '76. The
incoming freshman are getting rookied by the incoming seniors (at the
highschool). There original plans get ruined, but that doesn't stop them
from having fun. Anyways i don't want to spoil the movie so i wont say
anymore butt i definitly suggest you take the time to watch this movie. Its
got a great story to it and some good tunes through out it.
