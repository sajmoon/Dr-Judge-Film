  Remember that Don Dawson told Slater not to act like such a nerd in front
of girls!  He was te coolest one!<br /><br />  This is one of the greatest movies to grace us with its production.
Something unexpected, though... I have to tell those who didn't see it that
there is a bit of horror in it...the part when Ben Affleck's character shows
up...the sheer horridness of his face...scared me. Other than that, it is a
comedy.<br /><br />&quot;Freshmen.... you love us. Smile! You love us............AIR
RAID!!!&quot;<br /><br />
