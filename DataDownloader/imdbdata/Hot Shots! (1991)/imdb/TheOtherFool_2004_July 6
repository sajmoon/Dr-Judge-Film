Really funny movie spoofs Top Gun, Dances With Wolves and others. In the
centre is Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen), who is incapable of flying because
he thinks his dad is responsible for the death of his co-pilot.<br /><br />But one day he is called back into the squad, as there is a scheme going on
about some new airplanes. Oh well, never mind that.<br /><br />Funny stuff all the time, too much to talk about really. I love the 'Dead
Meat' character, when he is taking his last flight, claiming he knows the
answers to global warmth and Kennedy's assasination. That really cracked me
up.<br /><br />One of the best spoofs ever. 7/10.
