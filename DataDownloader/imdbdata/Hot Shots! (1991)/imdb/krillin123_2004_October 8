The great thing about the comedy in this film is that you never see
where the next jokes is coming from. The jokes are all unexpected and
sudden which adds to their impact. Charlie Sheen holds the whole thing
together very well as the 'hot shot' pilot and the supporting actors
and actresses also work perfectly. For example Cary Elwes as the
equivalent of Iceman from top gun and Valeria Golino as the love
interest. Jon Cryer is also worthy of mention. The two obviously work
well together as can be seen on a current TV series Two and a Half Men
starring Sheen and Cryer as brothers. Lloyd Bridges is also memorable
as the 'slow' Admiral. The only thing lacking was a real plot. I
would've liked to see a tidier story to make better reason for all the
humor.
