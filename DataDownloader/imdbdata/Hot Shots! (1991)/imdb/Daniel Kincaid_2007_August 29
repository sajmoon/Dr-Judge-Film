&quot;Hot Shots!&quot; is a comedy that parodies a number of films, particularly
&quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986). The cast is led by Charlie Sheen, who is an
appropriate choice for the role of Lieutenant Topper Harley. Also
notable is Cary Elwes as Topper&#39;s dashing flight school rival, Valeria
Golino as Topper&#39;s love interest and Lloyd Bridges as the flight
school&#39;s commander Lloyd Bridges&#39; performance is not as funny as his
role in &quot;Airplaine!&quot; (1980), but he has funny lines and scenes in this
film.<br /><br />The film&#39;s comedy is a mix of slapstick humor, quips and satires of
other movies. The film has great scenes, such as &quot;Dead Meat&#39;s&quot;
pre-flight musings and quotes such as &quot;Bogie at 12:00&quot;. I enjoyed how
this film parodied the juvenile pilot rivalry and the legacy of the
main character&#39;s father haunting him from &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986). I also
found most of the jokes based on &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990) amusing.
However, a number of the movie parodies are extremely random and seem
out of place and make the film feel disjointed at times, such as the
reference to &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976). The film has a number of amusing
moments, but the film&#39;s comedy is generally not on the level of the
&quot;Naked Gun&quot; movies or &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980) which are more focused comedy
films in a similar vein and both also contain writing from Jim
Abrahams.
