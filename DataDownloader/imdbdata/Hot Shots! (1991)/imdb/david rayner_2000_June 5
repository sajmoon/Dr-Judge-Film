A wonderful parody of Top Gun. Charlie Sheen is astonishing(I didn't know
he
did comedy) but so is everyone else. We're on
our fourth viewing, and still spotting new stuff (view the interior of the
Tee-Pee carefully!) All the humour is light, good natured, the film is
even-paced; in fact you can start viewing it at any point!)
Congratulations
to all involved.
This is a good film for after the pub!
