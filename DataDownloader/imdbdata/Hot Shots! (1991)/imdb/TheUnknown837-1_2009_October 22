Like its much superior sequel, &#x22;Hot Shots! Part Deux&#x22;, the original
1991 picture &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22; is exactly the sort of spoof-parody that a
major moviegoer will enjoy, even though this one only scraped the
surface for me. It&#x27;s not a parody of one movie entire. Rather, it
encompasses its world in the setting of a one-movie parody and then
within that world, throws jokes and references and satirical gags at us
over and over again for eighty-four minutes without end. The movie it
imitates in look and plot is the Tom Cruise career-launcher &#x22;Top Gun&#x22;,
but it&#x27;s really also a parody of &#x22;Dances With Wolves&#x22; (1990), &#x22;The
Godfather&#x22; (1972), &#x22;Gone With the Wind&#x22; (1939) and many others.<br /><br />One thing I can&#x27;t gripe about is the casting. It&#x27;s terrific and
thankfully the majority of this cast was preserved for the sequel.
Charlie Sheen, though perfectly competent as a serious, deterministic
actor, proves he can also be very funny and yet charming at the same
time. Valeria Golino brilliantly manages to work out a charming
character from a one-note performance from one-note material. And
there&#x27;s Lloyd Bridges, who never fails to crack a laugh as a bumbling,
rather idiotic military admiral who seems to have had to replace some
part of his body since he seems to have been in just about every single
battle of every single war of the past sixty years.<br /><br />So what did not work for me? Well, simply because I only grinned here
and there at the way the parodies and jokes were staged as opposed to
the way I rolled on the floor laughing at them in the sequel &#x22;Hot
Shots! Part Deux.&#x22; In addition, some of the character connection, I
felt, was not quite, well, connected the way it should have. I don&#x27;t
mean it had be locked down, but a little more so that it is. Cary
Elwes, for example, gets second-billing, but I didn&#x27;t feel any real
sense of play from his character and yes, even in a movie like &#x22;Hot
Shots!&#x22;, there still needs to be some sense of place, as there was in
the sequel, even if it&#x27;s just random space. In the end, I laughed at
&#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22;, but not nearly enough to fully recommend it. My
suggestion is to, ironically enough, see the sequel first. It&#x27;s
funnier, more random, more whacky, sillier, has a better stage of jokes
and movie satire. And then, if you&#x27;re interested, come back and see
&#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22;.
