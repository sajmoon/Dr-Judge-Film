Hot Shots, I would say is one mother of all spoofs! The others I loved
include the Scary Movie series, Johnny English, Austin Powers, etc.
But, this one takes the cake. Though just a short movie, just over an
hour, it packs in tons of humor, though logic defying, will keep you
thoroughly entertained and give a year&rsquo;s dose of laughter therapy!<br /><br />Topper Harley played by Charlie Sheen is a dropout Navy Pilot living
among Indians. He is called back to duty for a top secret mission and
it appears that someone doesn&rsquo;t want this mission to succeed. Adding to
the fun are Lloyd Bridges as the dumb boss Admiral Benson and Valeria
Golino as the much sought after base psychiatrist.<br /><br />Of the many movies that it spoofs, the most notable is Top Gun. There
is a little bit of boxing from Rocky, at bit from the old Gone with the
Wind, and many more movies. The lead characters are really very
hilarious. There&rsquo;s no point discussing scenes coz it would amount to a
Spoiler. Well, I am curious to see its sequel, Hot Shots! Part Deux.<br /><br />The action packed nature of this movie along with unbelievable stunts
gives the much needed spice. If you would ask me to pick up the best
sequence of all, I would pick the adventurous amorous scene between
Sheen &amp; Golino. It&rsquo;s actually difficult to pick one best scene among
many! About song, &lsquo;dream lover&rsquo; seen with the credits is a nice one.
