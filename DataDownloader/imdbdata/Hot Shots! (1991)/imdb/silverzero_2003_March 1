Top Gun gets the ! treatment in this zany air force spoof. While it doesn't
deliver as many laughs as did Hot Shots: Part Deux, it does have a better
comic timing. The individual scenes are very funny and quite memorable, the
scene where he sizzles eggs on her stomache is a laugh riot.<br /><br />The cast isn't outstanding but it works well together. Charlie Sheen is the
hopelessly macho hero and has fun with the role. Cary Elwes is good as his
snobbily British rival. He's better in support than as the main character as
&quot;Robin Hood: Men In Tights&quot; showed us. Lloyd Bridges is funny as the goofy
president, though he was a lot better in the sequel.<br /><br />Few of the jokes miss and if one bad joke should slip by, whats the harm.
Never less then enjoyable, Hot Shots is an instantly likeable spoof comedy
that doesn't primarily try to take the p*ss out of Top Gun, but serves as a
very memorable movie. This is truly the way spoofs should be done.<br /><br />It's not &quot;artisticly beautiful&quot;, but its fun to watch and quite enjoyable,
and thats good enough. 6.8/10
