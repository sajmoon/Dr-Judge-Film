1998_December 22 

Hot Shots is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in my life. I
laughed so much it nearly made me sick to my stomach. There's really no
better proof of a great comedy than when you laugh from beginning to end.
Lloyd Bridges is hilarious and Charlie Sheen is really great at these type
of films. The whole cast is great. Jim Abrahams has made a modern classic in
my opinion.
