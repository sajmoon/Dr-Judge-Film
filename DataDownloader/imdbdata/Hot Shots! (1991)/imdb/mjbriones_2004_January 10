I have been waiting for Hot Shots! to come out on DVD for ages and
stumbled
upon it at the store yesterday.  I watched it and there are so many sight
gags - it is a lot like the stuff written by the Airplane producers - you
can watch it 10 times and see new things each time.  It is truly a
classic
and hilarious.  I'm so glad to have added this to my collection.  5
stars!
