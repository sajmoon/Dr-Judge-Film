This is a spoof, and a great one at that! As serious as TOP GUN was, Hot
Shots! is as funny. The cast is great! Lloyd Bridge as Admiral Benson is
at
his funniest. Who'd have thought Charlie Sheen would be this good in a
comedy? He plays Fluffy Bunny Feet/Topper Harley. The very lovely Valeria
Golina plays Ramada, the love interest. The only semi-wooden performance
was
by (surprisingly) Cary Elwes, who is usually very good. The dialog is a
real
gas, but always LOOK for sight gags, because there are a LOT of them. The
sight gags start during the opening credits and continue throughout the
film. This film will keep you laughing all the way through.
