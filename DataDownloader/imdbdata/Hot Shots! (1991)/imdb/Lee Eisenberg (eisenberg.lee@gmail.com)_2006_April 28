I&#39;ve never seen &quot;Top Gun&quot;, but as far as I&#39;m concerned, &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; is
sufficient! Since this is from the guys who gave us &quot;Airplane!&quot;, that
should tell you everything about it. There is actually a plot: loner
Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) goes into the air force, and a series of
goofy things ensue. But don&#39;t let that fool you. Just sit back and
enjoy the gags (the one about the relatives should send you off the
walls).<br /><br />As far as I&#39;m concerned, Charlie Sheen really does work best in these
kinds of roles. Also starring Cary Elwes, Valeria Golino, Lloyd
Bridges. The sequel was absurd, but still quite funny.
