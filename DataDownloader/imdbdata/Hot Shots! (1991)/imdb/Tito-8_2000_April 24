Several years ago, I started to watch this film, but I stopped because I
wasn't laughing at all.  However, last night I finally gave it a second
chance, and I found it to be quite enjoyable.  Sure, lots of the jokes land
with a thud, but there were still enough good ones to keep me laughing
throughout.  It's by no stretch the best comedy that I've ever seen, but
it's still lots of fun and definitely worth checking out.
