1999_October 21 

Back in 1991 a friend of mine celebrated her birthday by inviting all her
friends out to see this movie. Good choice. Admittedly, it's not quite as
funny as Airplane! But it's easily the equal of Top Secret! To me, Hot
Shots! was the last great Zucker movie. Everything since has been so-so.
Whether it's looking at Charlie Sheen through a fisheye lens or listening
to
lines like &quot;I've fallen for you like a blind roofer,&quot; this is an all-out
funny movie. It's not perfect, but for every one-liner that fails, there's
eight more that really work. The sight gags don't score as high: too much
reliance on movie parodies, the same thing that made the Naked Gun sequels
so formulaic. But whenever Hot Shots! remembers it's a parody of Top Gun,
it's great.
