Haunted by feelings of guilt over the actions of his father Buzz and
having been kicked out of the navy, Topper Harley has withdrawn from
the navy to a life of solitude, quiet contemplation and helium. However
when Lt Commander Block comes to him with an offer of a second chance,
to take part in secret mission Sleepy Weasel, Topper takes it up and
signs up for training and briefing with the other pilots. However with
a difficult love interest and his old fears resurfacing, can Topper
hold it together? Can the mission succeed? Can Admiral Benson get it
together? Only time, will tell.<br /><br />The spoof genre is one that appears easy to do but things like Scary
Movie, Spaceballs and others all show that it is not as easy as it
appears &#150; it is not enough to simply ape films unless it is done
cleverly and funnily as well. Hot Shots succeeds in this area by
managing to make such fun out of serious films that it is hard not to
laugh &#150; in fact I watched Top Gun recently and found it impossible not
to laugh as I remembered Hot Shots! Of course it is not just the fact
that it spoofs movies but also that the dialogue is really, really
funny &#150; totally off the wall and takes you by surprise at times. A fine
example of this is the dialogue given to Admiral Benson such as 'they
ran out of material before they got to the knee so don't give me any
sh*t'! This continues throughout the film and it rarely misses. Just
like Top Gun the romance aspect isn't as funny as the other bits but
even then it is still good. Some individual lines aren't as sharp as
others but generally the film has enough great dialogue and funny movie
spoofs (including quite a few Tom Cruise movies) to be consistently
funny even after repeat viewings.<br /><br />The cast is often important in this type of thing and those who have
suffered the Wayans brothers mugging in their 'spoofs' will know
exactly what I mean &#150; people like Leslie Nielsen make it look easy but
it really isn't. And that is why the cast here should be largely
praised for their straight delivery that serves to make the material
even better. Although not the star of the film, every scene he is in is
stolen by Lloyd Bridges &#150; so great in Airplane, he gets the best lines
here and his character is hilarious. He is supported well by Sheen who
proves really able in sending himself up and he has done well in other
spoofs since then. The rest of the cast is made up of very familiar
faces who all seem in tune with the material provided &#150; Elwes is fun;
Cryer and O'Leary embrace their one-note characters. Golino is a bit
dry in her delivery and doesn't help her already weak part in the film.
Minor roles for Swanson, Stiles, Dunn and others are also good value
for differing reasons and there are a few good cameos in there as well.<br /><br />Overall, as with all these things you need to be in the mood but the
strength of the material and the high hit ratio makes it easy to enjoy
this film. Much more fun that Top Gun and consistently funny with
regular laugh-out-loud moments this is a great spoof that is only just
short of the greats like Airplane and Naked Gun.
