This is a pretty good comedy. Some really funny moments. If you want the
top
of line spoof...check out AIRPLANE! If you have seen both of these
films...well...CHECK THEM OUT AGAIN DARN IT! You won't be sorry. I do
recommend that you avoid Hot Shots Part Deux. Wow for terrible!! Hot
Shots
gets 4 out 5 stars!
