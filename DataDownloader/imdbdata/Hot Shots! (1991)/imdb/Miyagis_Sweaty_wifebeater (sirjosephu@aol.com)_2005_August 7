Hot Shots! (1991) was another solo effort from Z.A.Z. member Jim
Abrahams. In keeping with the tone of his other films, the humor is
just like that of Airplane! and Top Secret! This time, Jim Abrahams
takes on the Top Gun films and others of it's ilk. Charlie Sheen stars
whilst Valeria Golino, Cary Elwes, Jon Cryer and Lloyd Bridges co-star.
But like it's brethren the humor is real dated and some of the jokes
don't work like they used to. But I wouldn't miss watching it again if
it was on the idiot box. I wonder what the film would have been like if
the Z.A.Z. team worked on it? Followed by Hot Shots! Part Deux.<br /><br />Recommended for laughs.
