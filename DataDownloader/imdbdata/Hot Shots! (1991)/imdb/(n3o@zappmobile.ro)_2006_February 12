2006_February 12 
It's 2006 and I still believe this is one of the best parodies of all
times, worth to include next to Spaceballs, Naked Gun and Scary Movie
(all 3 of them).<br /><br />From time to time I like watching such movies, since I'm sick and tired
of all the modern &quot;shoot 'em up&quot; or &quot;philosophy for n00bs&quot; type of
films. It's relaxing and a good laugh always makes you forget about
everything else.<br /><br />Now that was besides the point. Getting back to &quot;Hot Shots&quot;, I can say
only one thing - excellent. And to be honest, every movie that starred
Charlie Sheen I've seen since was dull. Maybe it's a little unfair to
remember Charlie Sheen only for this role (he's a very good actor), but
he was so...funny in it that I can't help it. The movie itself is very
well glued together, the scenes are dubbed with the perfect soundtrack
to make you laugh 'till you fall off your chair and the comedy
techniques are (as somebody said before me) classic - no fart/burp
jokes or toilet humor.<br /><br />Overall, I'd watch it anytime.
