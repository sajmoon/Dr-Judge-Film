Very silly and very absurd but very hilarious parody film. What makes
this goofy movie so entertaining is that the actors take the zany roles
very seriously, thus making the film so much funnier. Quite a few
spoofs, ranging from top gun, full metal jacket, dances with wolves
(hahaha), gone with the wind, superman, and with numerous allusions to
many other films, you don&#39;t need to see those films to enjoy hot shots.
charlie sheen is never funnier and lloyd bridges is so hilarious
hahaha!! (a bazooka round at little big horn... or was it okinawa?
hahahaha) the film is so full of goofy sight and sound gags and silly
dialogue if you blink you will miss something, its that type of film,
much akin to airplane or naked gun movies. there is a plot but its not
terribly important. the supporting cast is just perfect, no dull
characters. warning: if you are a dedicated member of the united states
air force there is a high likelihood you will be offended by this
film&#39;s satirization.
