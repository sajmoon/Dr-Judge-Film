Hot Shots is one of my favorite movies when it comes to comedy. It was
made in a time that farting and burping weren't yet considered as the
very best humor has to offer. <br /><br />This film is very enjoyable when you don't know any of the movies this
parody has been based on (very hard to believe), but when you do know
the movies, Hot Shots is really hilarious from time to time. Most of
the time they make fun of Top Gun, but movies like Superman, Dances
with Wolves, Gone with the Wind... can be recognized in it as well. <br /><br />Topper Harley is an excellent pilot who left the navy because he
couldn't cope with the feelings of guilt over his father. His father
didn't do enough to help his co-pilot during a mission and the poor man
got killed in an awful way. When he found out, Topper decided never to
fly again. He now lives on his own with an Indian and a wolf, inhaling
helium. However, when Lt Commander Block offers a second chance, to
take part in secret mission Sleepy Weasel, Topper decides to fly again,
although this means that he'll have to deal with a difficult love
interest and his old fears.<br /><br />This movie certainly scores above average when you ask me. Therefor I
reward it with a 7.5/10.
