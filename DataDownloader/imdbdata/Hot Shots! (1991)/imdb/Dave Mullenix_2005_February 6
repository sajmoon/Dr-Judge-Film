Jim Abrahams is from Shorewood, Wisconsin, a Milwaukee suburb. He went
to college at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Many local
references are slipped into Hot Shots:<br /><br />The &quot;Indian&quot; language dialogs with chief &quot;Owatonna&quot; include these
words:<br /><br />Owatonna - a city in Minnesota. <br /><br />Minnetonka - a city in Minnesota.<br /><br />Ojibwa - also known as Chippewa. A Great Lakes area Indian tribe.<br /><br />Nakomas - a Chippewa word meaning &quot;I do as I promised&quot;. &quot;Nakoma&quot; is a
neighborhood in Madison. <br /><br />Shakopee - a city in Minnesota. <br /><br />Itasca - a county in Minnesota (and a city in Illinois.)<br /><br />Minocqua - a city in northern Wisconsin. <br /><br />Minnehaha - &quot;Laughing Waters&quot; from Longfellow's poem, &quot;Song of
Hiawatha&quot;. There are Minnehaha's all over Minnesota and Wisconsin. <br /><br />Mendota - a city next to Madison, Wi.<br /><br />Mannetowish - a city in Northern Wi. <br /><br />Wauwatosa - a suburb of Milwaukee.<br /><br />Winnebago - a Wisconsin Indian tribe.<br /><br />In the barracks, when Wash Out admits he inadvertently ate Kent's
father (but didn't have seconds), several people turn out to be
connected to Eagle River, a town in Wisconsin (and Alaska, Michigan,
British Columbia, Colorado and who knows where else.)<br /><br />And finally, the hero's name is Topper Harley. Harley-Davidson
motorcycles are made in Milwaukee and Harley made a scooter named the
Topper in the early sixties.
