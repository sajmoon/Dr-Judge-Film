2009_December 7 
Having seen the terrific &#x22;Airplane!&#x22; and &#x22;The Naked Gun,&#x22; I felt like
there was very little &#x22;need&#x22; to make &#x22;Hot Shots!,&#x22; a spoof of &#x22;Top Gun&#x22;
and other military and non-military movies. Its predecessors targeted
entire genres that deserved to be made fun of: disaster movies
(&#x22;Airplane!&#x22;) and cop movies/TV shows (&#x22;The Naked Gun&#x22;). &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22;
takes aim at too broad a spectrum and despite a few good performances
is really just that same old subtle and literal humor from two of the
writers of those previous fantastic spoof movies, Jim Abrahams and Pat
Proft.<br /><br />The plot is incredibly immaterial in &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22; Anyone used to
watching one of the spoof movies from these writers is trained by now
to look for the jokes hidden throughout. In &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22; more of those
jokes are forced in and don&#x27;t tie in to the plot that they completely
detract from it. I can&#x27;t say I gave the film a concerted effort, but I
don&#x27;t remember what it was about other than ace pilot Topper Harley
(Charlie Sheen) being afraid to fly because of the death of his father.<br /><br />Sheen, although not bad, is also not the type of comedian to best
handle this kind of material. He&#x27;s no Leslie Nielsen in &#x22;The Naked Gun&#x22;
and not even really a Robert Hays (&#x22;Airplane!&#x22;) who might not be as
good an actor in general, but knew how to play this kind of humor. Part
of this could be that his character is written to be a hot shot, but
either way it just doesn&#x27;t make &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22; lovable.<br /><br />Still good for those one-time laughs when you catch a clever or
ridiculous joke, &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22; is not a failure by any means, just same
old, same old. Topper cooking breakfast on Valeria Golino&#x27;s midriff
instead of a sex scene is remarkably crazy and hilarious and being from
the Midwest, I appreciated that the Native American language consisted
mostly of towns in Wisconsin. Any film attributed to Abrahams, Proft or
the Zuckers is always going to have its gems, but &#x22;Hot Shots!&#x22; as an
overall film doesn&#x27;t work as well as the classics they churned out in
the &#x27;80s.
