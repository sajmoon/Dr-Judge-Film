I bought this in Tesco for a tiny sum of &pound;4.00 because i heard that it
was really good, it has an 81% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes and
was a box office success, grossing over $180,000,000.There you are
kids, a bit of history, tell your friends!<br /><br />It took me a while (about 15 minutes) to get into the films humour, the
jokes at the start produce giggles, some were just unfunny but as the
film progressed the jokes got funnier and i was starting to see the
good film that the critics were talking about!<br /><br />I&#39;d love to spoil some of the funniest lines but, i&#39;m not gonna, there
are some real corkers in this film.<br /><br />What scores this film more points is that it was short, only 80 minutes
or so, so it doesn&#39;t drag on and get old.<br /><br />Maybe i&#39;m only giving this film a 7 because i missed some of the sight
gags or something, i don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll still be buying &quot;Part Deux&quot; if i
see it in the shops though, it&#39;s probably worth it.<br /><br />So the bottom line is &quot;Don&#39;t Shop For It, Argos it!&quot; no wait that&#39;s not
right.....hold on, i&#39;ll get it......AH! The Bottom line is:<br /><br />This film is funny, some good one-liners, sure, i wasn&#39;t laughing till
there were tears in my eyes (i&#39;ve only did THAT in a couple of films)
but i was still chuckling along with the film, it&#39;s not a classic but
it&#39;s still very good and the jokes will stay in my head for a while, as
a famous person said about another film &quot;It&#39;s impossible not to laugh!&quot;<br /><br />7/10
