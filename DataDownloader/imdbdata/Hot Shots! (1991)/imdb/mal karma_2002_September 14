I have no doubt that this is the best comedy ever. Why I say so? because
every time I watch I laugh like the first time. I've seen it like 30 time
already and every time I find out another joke. Just hilarious. Every one
was great at what they were doing, no matter character or actor. But the
flowers are for the great late Lloyd Bridges, he's the best of the best on
this film. Admiral Benson was more a mannequin than a man. It's amazing
that
that man got to be the US president in the sequel. Or maybe not. Anyway
this
is THE comedy, when it comes to laughs you can't stop. The sequel is a
little bit worse, but worth watching too.
