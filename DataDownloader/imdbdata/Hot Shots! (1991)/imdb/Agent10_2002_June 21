I watched this movie after watching a 
really poorly made one, so this film came 
off like Citizen Kane in many respects. After 
not watching this film for such a long time, 
I came into this viewing wit ha more trained 
eye, and to say the least, it was as good then 
as it is now. This is easily one of those 
parody movies that will live forever, especially 
due to all of the great scenes on the aircraft 
carriers (dogs chasing the plane, the dancing, 
etc.). While the film did have its dull moments, 
there were too many funny moments. Charlie 
Sheen seemed perfect for this role, simply 
because it looked like he tackled this movie 
with a serious purpose. Cary Elwes was also 
good, considering the stuffy Brit took on the 
whole comedy role quite well. Kudos to all who 
had a hand in this film.
