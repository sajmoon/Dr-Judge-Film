Newspapers said: Hot Shots is the mother of all films. I saw it and tried
my
best to laugh - but it was not funny at all. I was bored all the time. If
this film really was the mother of all films than the film industry can say
good night and stop producing. I usually like comedies and to have a good
laugh in films, even if it is a serious one, but this film disapointed me
so
much I can hardly explain. Maybe it is not my kind of humor. I know, many
others like this movie, but sorry, I can not find it funny at
all.
