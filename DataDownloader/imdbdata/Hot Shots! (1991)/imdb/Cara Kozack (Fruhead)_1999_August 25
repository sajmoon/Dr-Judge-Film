1999_August 25 

This movie is the most hilarious movie that I had ever seen!!  I'm sure I
missed most of the jokes because I was laughing so hard I had tears in my
eyes.  My brother had a stomach ache for the whole night because he
laughed
all the way through non-stop.<br /><br />Not only is the main plot really funny but so are the little jokes in the
background.  They don't make a point of it and just keep going along, like
when the general fell out of the airplane, then hit his head on the engine
like nothing happened.<br /><br />My two favorite parts of the movie are when the drilling soldiers are
doing
the Can-can and when the plane lands with most of it missing!
