Obviosly this was a spoof of Top Gun. I don&#39;t know why anyone needs to
spoof Tom Cruise, as I feel he does pretty good job of spoofing himself
with his jumping on the couch. Beside that, South Park spoof him better
than anyone I&#39;ve seen.<br /><br />Mel Brooks is the best at spoofs. They should t6ake some lessons from
him. There were a few laughs here, but most of the gags were pretty
stupid.<br /><br />I like Charlie Sheen, so I hung in there, but I will not be back.<br /><br />I have to say, Valeria Golino, where have you been all my life? Italian
and Greek, just like Michael&#39;s wife in The Godfather. I see she is
doing something with Harvey Keitel next year. I can hardly wait. I see
also that she was in a take-off of James Nond. I&#39;ll have to check that
out. I&#39;ll also have to look for Frida and Escape from L.A.
