2011_January 18 
Well, I&#x27;m a sucker for James Brooks&#x27; spoofs of popular films and even
though I&#x27;ve (purposely) never watched &#x22;Top Gun&#x22;, I laughed loud and
often at the million and one gags offered here. Charlie Sheen plays it
deadpan throughout, with Valeria Golino adding some Latin passion as
his &#x22;torn between two lovers&#x22; psychiatrist and of course Lloyd Bridges
replaying his patented Patton gone mad routine.<br /><br />References to numerous other Hollywood blockbusters from the recent and
not so recent past abound, as per usual, the funniest being the skit on
&#x22;The Fabulous Baker Brothers&#x22; and the &#x22;frying tonight&#x22; send up of &#x22;9
1/2 weeks&#x22; (you should see what this girl can do with an olive!). <br /><br />There are as many sight as verbal gags and naturally the scattergun
approach means that one or two of the jokes will have you wincing, but
don&#x27;t worry, a belly laugh will be along soon enough. And for what it&#x27;s
worth, the flying circus shots are very well done. I have &#x22;Part Deux&#x22;
recorded and will hasten to watch it the very next time I need a good
laugh after a long day at work - that&#x27;ll be soon then!
