There's a certain something about spoofs. Ever since &quot;Airplane!&quot; we've
endured countless remakes and sequels ending with exclamation marks. &quot;Top
Secret!&quot;, &quot;Mafia!&quot;, &quot;Naked Gun: From the Files of the Police Squad!&quot;,
&quot;Austin Powers,&quot; and countless others, all spoofing certain genres.<br /><br />There was a group of men for really getting the spoof industry started:
Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker, a.k.a. ZAZ to the fans. It comes as no surprise
that Jim Abrahams, one of those men, was a co-writer and the director of
&quot;Hot Shots!&quot;, a film spoofing mainly &quot;Top Gun.&quot; Something that worked about
films like &quot;Top Secret!&quot; and such is that though they spoofed a certain
genre, in that case spy movies, they also threw in gags spoofing some other
films. &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; is pretty much just a spoof of &quot;Top Gun,&quot; and you can
imagine how tiring watching one continuous gag can be. &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; is a
good film, dare I say funny, but it isn't as great as it could and should
have been. It's hard to explain: It's got the gags, but...it doesn't have
the quality gags, I suppose. It's just not quite as funny as
possible.<br /><br />There's always the common idiot in one of these slapstick films. The main
character who is oblivious to things going on around him, who takes the
stupid for serious. It worked for Leslie Nielsen in &quot;The Naked Gun,&quot; and in
this case, we've got hotshot pilot Topper (Charlie Sheen), who is recruited
into the Navy as a pilot. Sheen takes a lot of pointers from Nielsen's dry
slapstick; he is no Jerry Lewis, he is a man with serious expressions who is
in the center of bad happenings. His arch-nemesis (played by &quot;The Princess
Bride's&quot; Cary Elwes) is the Val Kilmer of this movie. In one scene, Elwes
reveals that his father's death was caused, in part, by Sheen's father.
Their fathers were both flying together when their plane started to go down;
Sheen's father ejected, Elwes' messed up his ejection and crash-landed the
plane, only to get shot by hunters mistaking him for a deer.<br /><br />One of the other men in their squad of fighter pilots reveals that his
father was the one who shot Elwes's dad. &quot;It's okay, anybody could make that
mistake--but it's all his fault,&quot; Elwes says, pointing at
Sheen.<br /><br />The humor works, and Sheen is funny, but he is no Leslie Nielsen, and the
film is no &quot;Naked Gun.&quot; This movie is more of a &quot;Naked Top Gun.&quot; The humor
is there, but the quality isn't as much as &quot;Airplane!&quot; or &quot;Naked Gun,&quot;
making &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; worth a rental but not a purchase.<br /><br />3/5 stars -<br /><br />John Ulmer
