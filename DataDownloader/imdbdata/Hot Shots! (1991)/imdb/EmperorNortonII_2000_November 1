I've always been a fan of Mad Magazine, and so I appreciate this sort of
humor in movies.  Some movies make good use of it, while others don't.
&quot;Hot
Shots!&quot; is by far the best movie of this kind!  Best of all are the little
gags you see in the background, like when the recruits do a kick-line
circle
in the window behind Col. Benson's desk.  And kudos to Valeria Golino for
having the most talented navel in movies!
