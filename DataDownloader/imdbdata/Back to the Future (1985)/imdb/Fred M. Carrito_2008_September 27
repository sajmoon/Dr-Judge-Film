It&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;s been 22 years since the original BTTF came
out, so the fact that the movie is that old shows it truly is a CLASSIC
in every sense of the word. I&#39;m so glad they made this trilogy, what a
wild ride it was. It certainly holds up to the test of time because
it&#39;s just as fun to watch it now as it was back in &#39;85. The world has
changed so much since then and watching these movies is a nice escape
from today&#39;s nerve wrecking reality. I wish I could get my hands on
Doc&#39;s time machine so I could go back in time to fix the mistakes I
made in my life... who doesn&#39;t!?! Cherish these movies and show them to
your kids and grandkids... they will love them so much you can count on
them sharing the adventure of Marty Mcfly and Doc well into their
FUTURE!
