Marty, a young slacker is sent 30 years back in time, and now has to
worry about not only returning, but not changing events that have
already happened, including that his parents met and fell in love.
Whilst this is rather 80&#x27;s(and granted, that has a charm of its own...
it can, however, also be really off-putting), it does stand up well
enough, with few jokes and gags having aged poorly. ...is one of those
bullies seriously wearing 3-D glasses? The characters tend to be
well-done, if there are some really obvious stereotypes(but it seems
intentional). Humor works pretty well, if it can be really silly and
goofy at times. The dialog is good, some really memorable lines. You
always understand the &#x22;science&#x22; aspect, without a lot of wordy
explanations, and there is no technobabble. The music is catchy. Acting
is great, other than some over the top performances(again, they didn&#x27;t
happen by accident). It&#x27;s a fun, rewatchable High School comedy flick
with time-travel. The climax is also surprisingly tense, for how
predictable parts of this can be. I recommend this to any fan of the
decade, the cast and the concept itself. 8/10
