This film is classic, and has stuck with me from childhood, and i am
guaranteed to watch it again and again. The story line is tight, the
idea original and the performance from all is amazing. Ranging from the
stereotypical bully played by Thomas Wilson, to Marty and the
similarities between him and his dad, played by Michael J Fox who at
times, sums up a teenager precisely, but most of all the manic facial
expressions and insane dialogue from Christohe Lloyd, who plays the mad
Doc &quot;Einstein&quot; character with such vigour it just makes me smile when
he&#39;s in the shot, let alone doing something. A great performance by
Lloyd capped this film off for me as being one of the best i&#39;ve seen.<br /><br />But the film itself is great stuff too...!
