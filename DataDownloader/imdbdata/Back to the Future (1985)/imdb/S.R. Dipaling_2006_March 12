2006_March 12 
HAve you ever had a movie experience from years before(let&#39;s use as an
arbitrary number,five years or more)that was so vivid,so exhilarating
that you could recall what day,time and even things as seemingly easy
to forget as the smell and tastes of the popcorn and soda you had at
the movie?<br /><br />For me,that was this movie,and I recall seeing it on a Sunday afternoon
in July,1985. The noise and visuals were so electric that I enjoyed
this film immensely. My only regret about the experience was that I
didn&#39;t get a chance to redeem the &quot;Free Pepsi with purchase of large
popcorn&quot;discount coupons they were giving out that day!<br /><br />In a pleasant,average California suburb,ordinary teenager MArty
McFly(Michael J.Fox,who was a youngish 24 when he filmed this) dreams
of being a rock guitarist as he works his way through school,helping
out brilliant-but-fringe local scientist Dr.Emmitt Brown(Christopher
Lloyd,adding to his wide range of characters). When an unforeseen
crisis interrupts Doc Brown&#39;s breakthrough time-machine
revelation,MArty is thrust into the machine and becomes the unwitting
first participant in time-travel. As if that weren&#39;t harrowing
enough,he&#39;s just found a way to break up his younger parents BEFORE
they met and now he has to feverishly find some way to get them back
together,lest he and his sibs will never be born.<br /><br />If you can suspend some level of disbelief while watching
this(and,really,when SHOULDN&#39;T you suspend some disbelief when watching
Spielberg/Lucas/Zemekis style of sci-fi films?),this film is as smooth
as silk and one fun ride! Besides Fox and Lloyd,Crispin Glover(lovably
strange and pathetic as Marty&#39;s once and future dad,George),Lea
Thompson(cute and vapid as once and future mom Lorraine)and Thomas
Wilson(thick-headed bully Biff,who is a lost treasure here,too) are
excellent in fleshing out the characters that stick in one&#39;s mind
regarding this film. Heck,Old MAn Peabody,Goldie Wilson,Jennifer
PArker,MArvin Berry(cousin of Chuck)and the persistently bald and
serious-as-heart-attack high school principal all add their own flairs
in this movies persona. Robert Zemekis parlayed his &quot;Romancing the
Stone&quot; success to create an even larger-than-life
action-fantasy-comedy,with help from plenty of sight and sound FX and a
hugely energetic soundtrack anchored by Huey Lewis and the
News(remember them?). This film isn&#39;t just a renter,this is a keeper!
Most people with a sense of fun who long for the eighties movies that
accented style over dark or haunting substance should definitely buy
this one,tape or DVD.
