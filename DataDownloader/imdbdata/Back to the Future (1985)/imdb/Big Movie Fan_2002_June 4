Time travel movies never disappoint-that is because the concept of time
travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about
at one time or another. What would happen if you went back in time and an
innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It's
something to think about.<br /><br />I won't reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for
those who haven't seen it. Let's just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly
ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated
by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played
brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without
causing any damage to the fabric of time.<br /><br />The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of
their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe
anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of
humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play
their parts great.<br /><br />Anyone who watches this movie will love it.
