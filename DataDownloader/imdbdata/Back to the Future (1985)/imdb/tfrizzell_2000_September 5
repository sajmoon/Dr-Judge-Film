&quot;Back to the Future&quot; is a very smart film that benefits from likeable
characters and an insightful screenplay.  Michael J. Fox accidently goes
back to 1955 in a DeLorean that has been turned into a time machine by the
wacky Christopher Lloyd.  Now Fox must bring his parents together after he
inadvertently changes the future.  It is not quite as complicated as it
sounds.  The film is great fun that seems brand new 15 years later.  A great
movie by Robert Zemeckis.  4.5 out of 5 stars.
