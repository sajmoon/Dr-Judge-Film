BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) **** Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea
Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. 
This generation's &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;?  Think about it.  Very popular
and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success
with tv's &quot;Family Ties&quot;, casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as
Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is
sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet
Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney).  There he meets up with his parents
to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must
see history repeat itself or perish.  High-concept hilarity and some truly
ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob
Zemeckis.  Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it
would be like if things were different...see what I mean.  Oscar-nominated
song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this
dynamo gem of a film.  Classic.
