When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the
whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn&#39;t make sequels they
extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.<br /><br />The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and
relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a
fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don&#39;t know how
soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty
McFly&#39;s (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you&#39;re not a
teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the
perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or
extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough
not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.<br /><br />Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael
J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom
Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story.
