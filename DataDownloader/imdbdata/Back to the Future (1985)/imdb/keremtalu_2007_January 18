This is the best movie ever in all of the time-travel stories.These
back to the future films are my favorite films,i have watched them at
least 10 times and i still enjoy them very much especially for the
first one. Great story, remarkable screen shots and great performance
of Christopher Llyod and of course Micheal J.Fox. I&#39;ll never forget the
last scene which was very exciting.Actually this movie cause me and my
friend Caglar to question our lives and also the possibility of
time-travel for changing the things in our lives.But i&#39;m still not sure
if you can go past and change the time-line and affect the future
events then go back to the that alternative future.As doc says the
future hasn&#39;t been written and the things we did in our lives would
make our future.
