Back to the Future <br /><br />This will probably be the shortest review I ever write. And that is
only because this movie is so great I want to give away as little as
possible.<br /><br />It first off has a terrific and memorable score. It also is very funny;
humor is well-placed, witty, enjoyable, and appropriate. This movie
doesn't fall into large plot holes such as other time travel films, and
has a terrific end. The actors are all awesome; all parts are
well-acted. <br /><br />Special effects are pretty good for the era as well. The story is
engaging and actually makes sense(some time-travel films make
absolutely no sense). It's a great start of Robert Zemeckis' career,
and I love it. <br /><br />Great Scott, a great film! 10/10 classic.<br /><br />&quot;Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan, and told me if I
didn't ask Loraine to the dance, he'd melt my brain&quot;-Back to the Future
