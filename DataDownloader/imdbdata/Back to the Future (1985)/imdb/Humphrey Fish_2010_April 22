I had seen only the ending of this movie a long time ago one year, and
so then I decided to see the whole movie one day. And so I actually did
get to see this whole movie. What is my overall opinion on this movie,
I can say that I was really thrilled all the way throughout the movie,
this movie is also a time traveling good time! I also remember that at
a lot of the very funny parts in this movie, I was really laughing and
laughing! In my point of view, this movie is one of the greatest
science fiction movies that I have seen in my life, it is even as good
as some of the other really great science fiction movies like Star
Wars, I just think that this is one of the greatest science fiction
movies ever to be made, and not only that, it is also a movie that
really requires viewing as part of your movie education! This movie
really gave me a desire to do some time traveling, though I will never
be able to time travel, but it would be great if we could time travel!<br /><br />As for this movie, I believe that I should have seen this really
fabulous film a long time ago, because of how marvelous that it is, I
was totally thrilled and thrilled with this marvelous movie! I think
that this is also another movie that has really changed my life,
because this is now one of my all time favorite movies, it also ranks
really high up in my list of all time favorite science fiction movies
ever made, as well as top movies of the year of 1985! <br /><br />You&#x27;ve really got to see this, because it is one hell of a marvel of a
movie, when you see this, you are probably going to become hooked on it
like I did, because you are going to think that you should I have seen
this a very long time ago! <br /><br />10/10
