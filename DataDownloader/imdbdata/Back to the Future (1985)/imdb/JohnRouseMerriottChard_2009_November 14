It&#x27;s 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of
Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future-a film about
a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in
time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis
is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn&#x27;t capturing
the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz
is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences
in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice
anyway but couldn&#x27;t get a release slot from shooting with Family-Ties.
But the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play
Marty McFly as well as work on the show; the result would turn out to
be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.<br /><br />It&#x27;s honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn&#x27;t like Back To
The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face
it, it&#x27;s a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses
some people because of its Western themed plot {the heathens that they
are}. But really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all
the family as you could wish to view. It&#x27;s a water tight script from
Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel
paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15
minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something
that really gives Marty&#x27;s 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience
can buy into as the comedy relief comes in spades. The set pieces are
first rate-hello skateboard-hello rock &#x22;n&#x22; roll 101, and the makers
have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the
way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is
tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat
that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring &#x26; pleasing
score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis &#x26; The News,
is infectiously enjoyable. Finally it&#x27;s the cast that seal the deal for
why this is as good as it gets for fantasy escapist cinema. Fox,
Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson &#x26; Crispin Glover are
the perfect quintet, each feeding off each other and doing justice to
the excellently constructed story.<br /><br />Made for $19 million, Back To The Future went on to make a worldwide
gross of over $381 million, and those are the kind of figures you
really can&#x27;t argue with. It&#x27;s snappy, happy and down right funny, so
really, if you don&#x27;t like Back To The Future?, seek medical help
immediately. 10/10
