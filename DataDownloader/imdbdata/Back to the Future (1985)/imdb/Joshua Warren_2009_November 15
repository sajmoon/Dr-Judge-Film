Of course it&#x27;s not the most serious or deep movie in the world, but
it&#x27;s 1 hour and 48 minutes of pure fun and excitement. This movie was a
a classic when it was new, and it has dated well. Even people who don&#x27;t
like old films have both seen and loves this movie. The acting and
casting is spot on, the effects are revolutionizing for it&#x27;s time and
the story is brilliant, not very logical but who cares.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox is great as Mary McFly and Christopher Lloyd is at his
best in the role as the quirky but genius Doc Brown. And the rest of
the cast is just great especially Thomas F. Wilson as Biff who we get
to see more of in the two sequels.<br /><br />I really don&#x27;t think I need to give you a synopsis, if you&#x27;re one of
those who haven&#x27;t seen this film, just read the IMDb synopsis. but
don&#x27;t bother just watch the film.<br /><br />This movie is exiting and hilariously funny, this is a movie perfect
for anyone. It doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of movie genre you like it&#x27;s
hard not to like this film. I&#x27;m not quite sure what more I can say but;
if you haven&#x27;t seen it, Watch it now! Buy it, rent it, download it,
whatever just see it. And don&#x27;t forget it&#x27;s a trilogy. I can&#x27;t
recommend this film enough. I give it a 10/10.
