Back to the Future is just one of those movies that no matter how many
times you&#x27;ve seen every time you flip by it when channel surfing you
always stop on that channel and watch it again. I&#x27;ve probably seen this
movie a 100 times since I was a kid but if I stop on HBO and its
playing I just can&#x27;t help but at least watch a few minutes of it before
returning to my channel surfing.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox was the absolute best actor to choose to star in this
movie, he has great screen presence that whenever he&#x27;s on TV he grabs
your attention. It&#x27;s such a shame the health problems he has had that
such great skills are going to waste.<br /><br />The movie has so many great lines that I still quote to this day.
