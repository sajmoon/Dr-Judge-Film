Back to the Future is a fun comedy about a teenager Marty McFly(Michael
J. Fox) who has a less than perfect family and is friends with a
scientist, Dr. Brown(Christopher Llyod) and he accidentally time
travels back to 1955 when his parents are in high school. His mother
falls in love with him and he needs to get his parents to love each
other, otherwise he will be erased from time. The film, although not
completely reliant on special effects, has very good time travel
effects. The acting is very good too, more specifically Llyod&#x27;s
performance because he is just hilarious. Biff(Tom Wilson) is also a
good villain THe movie is funny, exciting and weird, which make for a
great film that anyone would want to see!
