This film is just one of a kind. The charm and wit are so good it will
have you wonder how they came up with such a concept, Michael J Fox is
at his best as are the rest of the cast. Humour,comedy, science
fiction, this film has it all. This film will remain timeless,I would
urge anyone who loves films to add this one to their list now. The
special effects are still great looking and look far better then most
effects today, your heart will still be in your mouth when Marty races
towards the clock tower in a bid to get struck by lightning, this is a
film you will watch again and again and will always put a smile on your
face.
