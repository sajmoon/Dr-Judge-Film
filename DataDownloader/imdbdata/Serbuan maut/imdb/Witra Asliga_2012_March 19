Surely I was lucky enough being chosen by Indonesia International
Fantastic Film Festival (iNAFFF) committee as one of local
movie-reviewers to see it on the big screen as a closing movie last
fall. Yes, The Raid from Merantau Films and XYZ Films has become global
most-awaited action movie after won Midnight Madness Award on 2011
Toronto International Film Festival. Afterwards, Sony Pictures called
for a Hollywood remake after got the rights for international release
first including U.S. market on March 23, 2012 - same date for hometown
release. <br /><br />An elite group of SWAT police officers receive a very difficult task,
invade an apartment building that has been taken over by large network
of dangerous criminals led by Tama. The chief Jaka with two of his
reliable members, Rama and Andi moves one level to another, only to see
their best plans being sidelined. Yet character revelations start
bubbling to surface which should be done by a series of immense fights
using guns, knives or even bare fists. Who will be the last man
standing with less victims on his side? <br /><br />Director Gareth Evans continue his success from Merantau (2009) by
upping the intensity in such bigger way. The location itself creates
some unintentional claustrophobic atmosphere to make sure those cat and
mouse fights have really nowhere to hide. Shaky-cam and quick cuts are
used perfectly to maximize viewers&#x27; involvement into dynamic sense of
rhythm. So, you feel like capture those moments with your own taste
before transform &#x27;em all into some certain reactions like grasp,
goosebumps etc.<br /><br />Jakarta born, Iko Uwais clearly made the most gigantic impact with his
extraordinary fighting skills on display which known as Pencak Silat,
our very own traditional martial-art. Yeah, you might compare him with
Thai&#x27;s Tony Jaa from Ong Bak. Combined with cold-blooded Donny
Alamsyah, the duo are serious combo to beat. High-experienced actor,
Ray Sahetapy also nailed his role as a super villain Tama with slick
face expressions and dreadful voice tones. Another name who stole the
show is Yayan Ruhian whose crazy act as Mad Dog might be remembered by
the fans of the movie for a long time.<br /><br />Violence is definitely an issue here, so it couldn&#x27;t avoid to be rated
R. Bath blood between one-on-one or group combatants are everywhere in
the building. Sometimes you just don&#x27;t see it clearly in front of your
eyes because flashy editing from Evans are smart enough to present what
should be seen or not without losing any meaning of it. &#x22;Hardcore&#x22;
music scoring from Aria Prayogi and Fajar Yuskemal successfully brought
the audience into silent mode for most of 101 minutes intriguing action
with less predictable twists along the way.<br /><br />Even though the budget is fair low, approximately $1,1 million, it is
effectively spent into every department of the movie. Basic storyline,
however, outplayed by convincing choreography from the casts. The Raid
is a non-stop action from start to finish, let the final battle alone
is near flawless. Absolutely impressive to keep audiences on the edge
of their seats, even still breathless when the credit titles rolling. A
must-see in the cinema to feel some rare &#x22;vibrant&#x22; experiences.
Respectful Evans has deliberately sent the message towards
international viewers that lesser-known Indonesian movie industry is
about to change in the next few years.<br /><br />http://databasefilm.blogspot.com
