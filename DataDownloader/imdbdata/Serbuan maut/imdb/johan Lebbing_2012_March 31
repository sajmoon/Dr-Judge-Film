This is an excellent actionmovie......a &#x22;this is how you make a great
actionflick&#x22; movie. Non-stop action, and also very bloody. All i can
say is, go and watch this very, very cool movie. I saw the actionpacked
movie &#x22;Ajeossi&#x22; ( Man from nowhere ), and th&#xE0;t was for me one of the
greatest korean films ever ( the movie is in my personal top 10 list of
best movies all time ).....i was truly stunned how the koreans can make
such movies like that. But, the indonesean filmmakers are also very
good in making actionflicks, like this one. I had never a dull
moment....this is how you make an action-movie. Go ahead and watch
this, you&#x27;ll be stunned....i was.
