When The Raid : Redemption hits the cinema in Indonesia on 23rd March
2012, the movie goers gone wild, the hype that has been build from last
December really really help, the media also help to promote the movie
with a various praise and extensive buzz, but the most helping part
is.. the internet. The Raid gets the Most anticipated Indonesian movies
ever since the Director made a blog about the upcoming project of his
movie called the raid, then it goes to a local forum in Indonesia
called Kaskus (which also happens to be the biggest forum in
Indonesia), and before long, the attention come to this project until
eventually this movie proved itself in a premiere in a local festival
called INAFFF (Short for: Indonesia Internasional Fantastic Films
Festival). The Raid gets a Massive praise from the early review, and
went abroad to a foreign festival where it too get a critical acclaimed
and won the Midnight Madness Award in TIFF (Toronto International Film
Festival), and This, is the Beginning of the successful story of The
Raid.. But enough with the wikipedia..<br /><br />The Raid tell us a story about a group of a local SWAT-look-alike
Police Squad, consist of 18 man including a rookie member Rama (Iko
Kuwais), trying to Raid a 15 floor height Apartment Block that shelter
the most wanted bad ass criminal led by a Crime Lord called Tama Riyadi
(Ray Sahetapy) and two of his most trusted man, the brutal Hit-man &#x27;Mad
Dog&#x27; (Yayan Ruhian) and Tama&#x27;s right hand man &#x27;Andi&#x27;. The SWAT Team,
led by Sergeant Jaka (Joe Taslim) and supervised by Liutenant Wahyu
(Pierre Bruno), then got trapped by the alarmed resident, and must
fight for they survival. a very recycle bin plot. But sometimes, when
the other part of the movies is so shining, the plot doesn&#x27;t matter
anymore.<br /><br />&#x22;Please, enjoy yourself..&#x22; said Tama the Crimelord while he instructing
all the criminal to find and kill all of the SWAT Group with the
intercom that broadcasts in the whole apartment. And soon, The massive
Horde of criminal are raiding them back with guns and knife and machete
and a martial art skill that they have. This movie promises us action
and blood, and thats what it delivers, A gunfight scene and a martial
art called &#x27;Silat&#x27; with a fatal move featuring of bone crunching, blood
spilling, neck breaking in about 3/4 duration of the movie. Its soo
brutal and violent that the foley artist must be having a hard time
finding correct sound to fill the brutally martial arts scene. Speaking
of that, the results of that fighting sound effect is actually great, a
mandarin martial art films great, and the fact that this movie is from
Indonesia, i think the foley artist should get an award for his work in
the local awarding festival.<br /><br />The fighting itself is absolutely mesmerizing. The beautiful &#x27;Silat&#x27;
Martial Art choreographed by Yayan Ruhian and Iko Kuwais, and with the
mix use of quick cut, editing, and camera angle are creative enough to
refresh the genre and entertain the viewers, the fatal move is so
brutal and yet realistic that will keep you glued to your seat for the
entire movie. You may know how the character is gonna be dead, but what
you don&#x27;t know is how. And with a great background music composed by
Fajar Yuskemal and Ario Prayugi (in Indonesian Version), The Raid is
really delivering the action with a guaranteed satisfaction.<br /><br />One thing that The Raid lack of is, the dialogue. it is so corny if you
understand Indonesian. But, if you don&#x27;t speak BAHASA, you might find
it okay. The cast are okay, but not so good. the veteran Ray Sahetapy
is just brilliant. His deep voice, his gesture, and his sometimes
innocent words are the living breath of Tama the Crime Lord. While Iko
Kuwais is not convincing enough for me as a SWAT team. But its only a
minor flaws that are forgettable when you see this movie.<br /><br />This is a new level of Indonesian Cinema. It may look just awesome in
Hollywood industry, but it means a lot for the Indonesian film
Industry. its not just the action that made us, the indonesians, watch
it and praise it, its the production value of the film. The value that
we hope will be followed by all Indonesian movies afterwards.<br /><br />------------------sorry for the grammar.. i know its bad, but i think
you know what i mean :)
