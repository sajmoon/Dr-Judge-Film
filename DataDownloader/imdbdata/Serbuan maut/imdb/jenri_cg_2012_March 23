when I arrived at The cinema at my home town to day, it currently show
6 movies, The Hunger Games, John Carter, Man on the ledge, Woman In
Black, Ghost Rider Vengeance and The Raid. So I decided to go for the
local first (yes I&#x27;m in Indonesia) and Hollywood Blockbuster 3D for the
last, which something that I regret at the and of the day. <br /><br />The Raid is actually a lame movie, compare with The Hunger Games for
ex. With a simple plot, something that you already seen in many
Hollywood movies before, and a very corny dialog, it seem that its
being written in English and translated to Indonesian.<br /><br />But Holly S*it man the action is **c**** Awesome....<br /><br />I&#x27;m actually hold my breath for nearly 60 minutes of this movie.
Because that is what this movie is all about. breathtaking The scene is
very tense, minute to minute. It&#x27;s brutal that visualize in a beautiful
choreographs. The Best Action Movie I&#x27;ve seen in decade. Yes I know,
Hard Boiled, Oldboys and even Tony Jaa&#x27;s cannot do what this movie did
to me. I&#x27;m planning to watch it again tomorrow. I had to, the action is
just worth some more viewing. <br /><br />And why I regret watching this movie first, because It made the rest of
that day completely dry. When I watch John Carter after this movie, I
felt really boring. Because I can still felt the knife that stab a man
2 times in the chest and rip off a man knee.<br /><br />so if you are a twilight fan (idiotic teenage girl and gay) this movie
is not for you. but if you are made completely of testosterone, go
watch this movie, It is made for you.
