The Raid: Redemption is a jarring piece of genre filmmaking set to a
furious pace. Arms, legs, necks and backs get &#x22;all jacked to hell&#x22; from
start to finish with barely a moments rest. However, behind the havoc
lies an impressive and undeniable poetry of movement on display by the
talented actors and stuntmen. They are a company of dancers, flawlessly
executing some the most exiting martial arts set pieces seen in recent
years, and Iko Uwais, in the lead role as Rama, is their &#x22;ballerino&#x22;.<br /><br />The Raid is economical in the area of plot, favoring mayhem over
exposition. A drug lord (Ray Sahetapy) has set up shop on the top floor
of a high-rise apartment building he controls. If police can defeat the
kingpin&#x27;s minions, they stand a chance to take him down. There is
double-dealing, treachery and a predictable plot twist baked into the
story, but it all falls second to the nonstop action that defines the
film and stands to cement director Gareth Huw Evans&#x27; status as a cult
hero. If you enjoy martial arts and action and don&#x27;t mind the
occasional exploding head or broken spine, this one is for you.
