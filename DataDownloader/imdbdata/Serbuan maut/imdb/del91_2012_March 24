It baffles me that a subtitle &#x22;Redemption&#x22; must be added to the name of
the movie, which is already perfect as it is - &#x22;The Raid&#x22;. Adding the
subtitle to the movie merely adds nothing more but confusion, as the
audience will be looking for a character looking for that trait. Roger
Ebert in his review gave the movie 1 out of 4 stars and expressed his
bewilderment over this issue. As if the subtitle will make the movie
sound cooler than it already is.<br /><br />No matter. &#x22;The Raid&#x22; is quite essentially one of the most brutal and
violent, and most relentless since John Woo&#x27;s &#x22;Hard-Boiled&#x22;, action
thriller ever made. Think the 30-minute shootout in &#x22;Hard-Boiled&#x22; and
fight sequences in &#x22;Ong-Bak&#x22; and &#x22;Tom-Yum Goong&#x22; combined and stretched
into 90 minutes and you get &#x22;The Raid&#x22;. It is a gung-ho exercise in
style and choreography. To criticize the plot is in futility. It&#x27;s
killed or be killed. Simple but effective, like it&#x27;s lead character
Rama, the film aims straight for the jugular.<br /><br />Responsible for this rush are rapidly-rising Indonesian martial-arts
star Iko Uwais and Welsh director Gareth Evans, the same team who
brought us the impressive &#x22;Merantau&#x22; years ago. Like &#x22;Merantau&#x22;, &#x22;The
Raid&#x22; is chock-laden of adrenaline pumping action sequences and
elaborately-choreographed Silat-infused fight sequences. Unlike the
former, however, &#x22;The Raid&#x22; unleashes Silat at its brutal
bone-breaking, head-busting, neck-snapping, gut-slashing,
knife-stabbing, kneecap- crushing best. Uwais clearly establishes
himself as a now-dominant force in the martial-arts movie industry, and
can proudly rank himself up there with fellow modern martial-arts pain
mongers Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa (whom he resembles apparently). He also
manages to give out some acting chops, unlike most martial-arts stars
today. Evans is also on the same path in terms of action-filmmaking,
his frenetic and kinetic direction really rivets the film into a
visceral viewing experience.<br /><br />Thanks to some gritty cinematography and production design, &#x22;The Raid&#x22;
immerses the audience into the situation at hand, although (sadly I
have watched the American release) the music score does not somehow do
the job in some scenes. The ending, I feel, is a bit of a cop-out. Too
often modern action movies end this way, and I really hoped it would be
like how the 80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s action films ended - with a bang instead of a
puff.<br /><br />Does the film glorify violence? There is certainly non-stop brutal and
sadistic bloody violence that it could be called a game-changer for
action films. I would have to say that - yes, the film does indeed
glorify violence, but in that 80s-90s way in which the clearly-
established-as-evil bad guys are mowed down relentlessly by the good
guys as the audience cheers in support of the heroes. The same thing
happened here. The audience I went with was small, but they were all
whooping whenever a goon gets dispatched with style.<br /><br />&#x22;The Raid&#x22; could be a hit, if the marketing would improve. Is it one of
the best action movies ever made - a game changer? Not really. But it
is definitely one of the most brutal and relentless of recent times.
Let&#x27;s hope Hollywood doesn&#x27;t come-a-calling so soon...<br /><br />Overall rating: 69/100
