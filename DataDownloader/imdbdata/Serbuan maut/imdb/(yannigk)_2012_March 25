OK, let me start by praising Iko Uwais. Of all the actors, this guy
fits the character flawlessly and is a highly likable actor. I thought
I&#x27;d root for Joe Taslim (Jaka) better because of his better looks and
taller figure but Iko is perfect.<br /><br />The movie in terms of story: interesting. The premise is very simple, a
bunch of cops trapped in a hellish building filled with the devil&#x27;s men
who knows silat and dead set on killing the cops. However, I can&#x27;t
really tell whats going to happen next, and there&#x27;s enough twists that
actually works, even if they were rather clich&#xE9; (the rookie, the
corrupt officers, the help from a friendly neighbor, the .. i should
stop.. or i&#x27;d spoil the movie). There&#x27;s nothing new in terms of plot,
but that&#x27;s not really a big problem. I sure do hope Gareth can find
better writers to write the story next time.<br /><br />What I do like is the pacing. It goes boom boom boom boom! and then it
rests a bit before going into suspense mode, scary mode, and then boom
some more.<br /><br />Line delivery? Not very good. Some lines were obviously translated from
English (it&#x27;s written by Gareth himself) and some sounds quite cheesy
(overused in other movies), like A: &#x22;Why us? why now?&#x22; B: &#x22;Why not?&#x22; Or
&#x22;I need to get in, my wife is sick&#x22; And a bunch of others..<br /><br />Secondly, some of them are not professional actors and as an Indonesian
watching an Indonesian movie without subtitles, I couldn&#x27;t catch most
of the things they said! I wished there were subtitles!! I wished there
were Indonesian or English subtitles so that the foreigners in indo can
enjoy the movie as well! (although there&#x27;s one guy with a manado accent
who talks funny, obviously a joke which will not be noticed by
foreigners) They either talked really quickly, or had poor
articulation/enunciation that I couldn&#x27;t hear what they said and had to
ask my sister, who also didn&#x27;t catch what they said, and had to ask her
boyfriend. The only one actor whom I can hear clearly even when talking
fast is the gang boss (Ray Sahetapi).. A veteran actor, obviously
trained for acting.<br /><br />By the end of the movie we also concluded that the Indonesian
vocabulary in terms of curse words is so very limited. The word
&#x22;anjing!&#x22; (means &#x22;dog&#x22;) is used over and over, by everybody.. And the
word &#x22;bangsat&#x22; (a bedbug) a few times.. &#x22;Babi&#x22; (pig) once, &#x22;kampret&#x22; (a
small bat) once... They all basically means the same thing &#x22;Bastard&#x22;...
So, this either means we are a really polite culture.. Or that they&#x27;re
trying to avoid censor.. Or that the translator for gareth&#x27;s script has
not enough vocabulary list... or maybe I really didn&#x27;t get the badness
of those animal curse words..<br /><br />I mean I can think of many English curse words that is not too dirty..
Like.. Scum, filth, bastard, jerk, son-of-a...., prick, damn, what the
heck, slime.. OK I don&#x27;t really know how to translate those words into
spoken Indonesian either so...<br /><br />The fights were great. I can&#x27;t comment on the choreography because I&#x27;m
not a professional, but it puts you on the edge of your seat, so I
think that speaks for itself. They hit hard, they fall hard, they kill
hard, they die hard. I thought that some fights could be sped up a bit,
as some moves looks like it lags a bit in terms of syncing, but only by
a bit. If not, it adds a real touch to the physicality of the movie.<br /><br />Most of the girls shrieked and made wriggling sounds during fight
sequences (yes, one really shrieked out loud), and many sighed a
relief, almost awkward laugh, when those fight sequences end. Which, in
my opinion, means that the fights were a great success.<br /><br />As an animator I felt the CG was a bit...hmmm... CG blood is slightly
overused, but still acceptable, but one shot stuck out like a sore
finger to me, the one where one guy falls over and lands on a balcony
ledge. I really wanted to fix that animation.. Hahahaa... But again,
that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a trained animator, as other people in the cinema
gasped in their seats thinking that was real etc.<br /><br />All I know is, it lived up to my expectations (a minimal story fight
movie). I look forward to Iko, Yayan, and Gareth&#x27;s next collaboration,
which is this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0hYVksfyrQ Again, if
you&#x27;re an action movie fans, you&#x27;d probably like it.
