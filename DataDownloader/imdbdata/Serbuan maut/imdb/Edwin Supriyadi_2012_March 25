Among us there must be an ever watched romantic comedy films in the
cinema while-do mention &#x22;ooowwwhhh!&#x22; on romantic scenes. It is &#x27;almost
identical&#x27; occurs when watching The Raid on the big screen, most of the
audience-do mention (shouts) &#x22;wuanjengggg!&#x22; Haha! Once was willing
titled as &#x27;Serbuan Maut&#x27; for domestic distribution is indeed thrusting
action scenes that make the audience swore and more swearing! I watched
The Fighter and Warrior which present the tightened the audience to
watch the live alike battle martial arts fight. However, The Raid able
to make more glaring eyes witnessed the martial action almost without
pause.<br /><br />In contrast to Gareth Evans who had served in Merantau (2009), a film
premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival is concocting all
kinds of battles and fights, as well as presenting a gun battle. It is
still promoting martial arts fighting action, but this time free use of
sharp weapons (indeed anything!) and far more brutal than ever shown in
Merantau.<br /><br />Enthusiasts of the genre of action films must have been familiar with
all the style of similar films from around the world ever. American
action films off course have a different style from European action
films. Asian action movies, particularly Hong Kong, usually the most
prominent because of the strong element of self-defense and always
looked real on the big screen. Well we&#x27;ll find a mix of all styles in
film action film The Raid; action of an armed attack is felt America /
Europe be continued with Asian martial arts fighting action. This
produces a combined massive action scenes are very-very horrible! A
background of Gareth Evans who was born in Wales - England but with
childhood joy watching action films of Hong Kong production may partly
explain the action formula presented in The Raid. Choreographed action
scenes and cinematography Gareth arranged with Iko Uwais and Yayan
Ruhiyan for six months before the official start shooting generate an
excellent visualization of action scenes.<br /><br />Among the action scenes that can make the audience breathless, The Raid
slightly poor in terms of story. The story was only explaining the
relationship between the main characters and tuck the twist which not
too surprising (although not easily predictable). The story is a
formula that has been common in genre films like; humble hero, raid,
trap, crime boss watch dog who is hard to beat, twist the story, the
truth / goodness still wins. It&#x27;s OK. And Gareth has chosen to sell the
actions.<br /><br />Performance of the actors in The Raid may be divided into two
categories: the character role and the action role. Action role
presented so dogged by Iko Uwais (Rama) and Donny Alamsyah (Andi). Joe
Taslim (Jaka) who appears as the commander can also look fierce with a
lot of improvisation from Judo. But the top champion of action should
be pinned to Yayan Ruhiyan who plays Mad Dog a cold, a bit silly, but
super fierce. My advice, never close your eyes when watching the
&#x27;threesome&#x27; scene of Mad Dog with Andi and Rama! Henky Solaiman was
always able to steal the show though here only appears briefly as a
father who is concerned about the safety of his son. But the audience
will be mesmerized by the appearance of Ray Sahetapy who plays Tama, a
local Mafia boss character who is very relaxed, but cold and cruel.
Shown eating instant noodles in short pants when facing the caught
intruders, Ray is able to make my skin crawl because it looks so real
and it may be a representation / characterization of real local
criminal boss! Gareth Evans once again finished the film with the
ending &#x27;open&#x27;. Although without a convinced story, one thing that can
be obtained from The Raid is that in this world no man is pure good or
bad.
