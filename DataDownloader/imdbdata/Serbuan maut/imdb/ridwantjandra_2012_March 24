The Raid aka &#x22;Serbuan Maut&#x22;, A spectacular action film filled with
scenes of sadistic and bloody in though with &#x27;Silat&#x27; movements that
make you in awe.<br /><br />The story is quite simple, A SWAT team was sent to arrest a criminal
kingpin who lives in an apartment, which happened in the apartment was
managed by him, and filled with vicious criminals, and hardship in
their invasion of the action begins once known by residents of
apartments, finally the massacre after massacre occurred from one floor
to another floor.<br /><br />This film just sells action &#x22;Silat&#x22; &#x26; Bullets, do not think too much
with all the gaps, because you are not given a chance to think (and
breathe) to see all the fight scenes with all the terrible and bloody
gore. Like watching a perfect action video game, filled with full
scenes of bullets shooting and fist fights.<br /><br />The film also slipped some humor, unfortunately Indonesian may be just
the person who would find it funny when hear the dialect from of one of
the goons dialog.<br /><br />Ray &#x27;Tama&#x27; Sahetapy is the only one I think is was good in the acting;
he could make criminal sadistic characters, crazy and authoritative.<br /><br />Regardless of the deficiencies that exist, this film deserves to be on
the watch for fans of action films and is very dear to the miss it.<br /><br />Hopefully in the &#x27;Brandal the next sequel, there is an improvement on
the story and acting...<br /><br />Once Again, don&#x27;t miss this movie !!!!
