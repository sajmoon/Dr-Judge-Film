First, i don&#x27;t know what the film is until my girlfriend ask to to
watch this awesome movie.... This is the first Indonesian movie with
best Dolby Digital so far I know... best sound design ever... i like
the movie scoring when Doggy kill Jaka. i like how the film scorer make
the scoring try to mute all of sound effect just using some pad in
lower key to produce a sound like &#x22;whhhooooooooooooooo&#x22; come out from
the theater sub woofers... its really fantastic. it can make the
audience feel the tension from this act...feel how the pain it is. <br /><br />congratulation... i prod of you guys (the film maker) hope there will
be another Indonesian movies like &#x22;The Raid&#x22; :)
