1999_August 1 

This was a pretty good movie.  In the beginning, I was yawning and was like,
Is this ever gonna get good?  But then it did, and it got so good that I
wish it was longer.  There's some parts that are really, really funny, and
the ending is so unexpected that I was just LMAO.  I went to see the movie
cause Alyson Hannigan is one of my fav actresses, and I must say I wasn't
disappointed.  She rules!  And she's so different from the roles I'm used to
seeing her in.  Go see this movie!
