1999_July 11 

This has got to be the funniest movie that I can remember seeing. It is
only
Sunday and I've seen this movie twice already! 3 minutes into the movie,
the
viewer knows it is going to be a great movie. Can't wait for the sequel
(If
you pay attention to the scene at the end in the diner, they leave it open
for the possibility for a sequel in college)
