I watched this in a hotel alone the first time, laughed out loud until it
hurt.  The second time was with four women.  I didn't think they would
find
it as funny as I did, but they proved me wrong.  They were in hysterics.
I
think it was funnier the second time.  Not sure if it was watching it with
other people or what.  We had to rewind it several times because we were
laughing too much, if that's possible.<br /><br />Very funny film. Four of Four Stars.
