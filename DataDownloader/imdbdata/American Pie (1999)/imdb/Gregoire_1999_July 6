1999_July 6 

I thought that this was a very funny movie.  The situations were comical
and
I am sure true to home for this generation of high school seniors. Since I
am 52, I was probably the oldest one in the sneak preview on July 5.  If
you
are a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on TV, you had an added shock to see
they character played by the actress who plays &quot;Willow&quot; on
Buffy.
