This movie is lots of fun. It has some offensive jokes in it... VERY
OFFENSIVE, but it makes up for it with some romantic scenes as
well.<br /><br />The movie is wild and over top with lots of original moments. The best thing
about this movie that it's repecting the characters and lets them develop to
good and decent people.<br /><br />A very nice feel-good movie. Better watch it with friends.
