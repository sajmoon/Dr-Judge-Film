1999_June 17 

I saw the film a couple of weeks ago at a test screening and I have to say
that the negative reviews here are unfounded.  Maybe the film isn't very
intellectual and resorts to some &quot;bathroom&quot; humor, but I don't go to
comedies to be enriched as a human being - I go to laugh.  So far this
year,
I have not seen a funnier movie than &quot;American Pie,&quot; and that includes
&quot;Austin Powers 2.&quot;  When it was over, I actually felt satisfied - when's
the
last time you could say that after watching a movie?  It's been a while.
I
don't see how these people can trash a film that actually delivers.  Trash
&quot;Instinct,&quot; sure, but not this.  Much as I hate to put money into the
studio
that gave us &quot;Patch Adams,&quot; I plan to buy a ticket and see &quot;American Pie&quot;
again.  Seeing such a fall-down funny movie with a large, loud audience is
an experience in itself.
