1999_July 19 

I thought American Pie was a compilation of many different films I've seen
in the past all put together to make up the funniest movie I've seen since
&quot;Dumb and Dumber.&quot;  It had the gross humor of &quot;There's Something About
Mary&quot;
and the highschool setting of &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; just to name
a
few.  I thought the movie was well made and it was nice to see a fresh
crop
of young actors making such a surprising movie without needing a big name
actor to bring in the publicity.  The content did that for them.  Thumbs
up!!
