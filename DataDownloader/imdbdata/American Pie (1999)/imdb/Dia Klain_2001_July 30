In this popular story on sexual frustrations of teenagers there are no
really whitty lines, no interesting, unique, or intricate characters, no
real plot to speak of. No artistic directing. What there is is a bunch of
cheep laughs gained by totally stupid activities. Even the supposed
perversities are not all that perverse. Those who will like it already know
they will like it before they saw it. In my believe if there is a straining
for the mindless idiotic laugh &#145;tis altogether better to skip it and watch
Scary Movie instead, which, at least, presents some amusing parodies.
