1999_July 19 

This movie has been compared to Something About Mary, but
it's
much sweeter and less relentlessly offensive than that film.  Yes, it tries
to shock, but it just isn't in the same &quot;anything goes&quot; league.  For that
reason, I liked it a lot better.  It's not as funny as I expected, but it
was a lot more substantial, and that's not a bad thing.  Great performances
from a lot of
young people to watch.  My major complaint is that Natasha Lyonne was
inexcusably under-utilized.
