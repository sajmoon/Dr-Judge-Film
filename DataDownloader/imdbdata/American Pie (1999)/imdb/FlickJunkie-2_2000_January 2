Over the years there have been dozens, maybe hundreds of high school
hijinks
films, most of which are sophomoric caricatures which try to outdo each
other in the grossness of their cliches.  American Pie has run away from
its
pubescent pack by capturing high school the way it really is.  Four years
of
frustrated preoccupation with sex; what it is, who's done it and how to get
it.  This movie is hilarious, mostly because it depicts the essence of what
it is like to be wrestling with the confusion of emerging sexuality while
trying to convince everyone else that you are cool.<br /><br />Director Chris Weitz has found the right balance between sexual obsession
and teenage self consciousness.  The fact is no-one is as experienced as
they pretend, and they're scared to death of the embarrassment it would
cause if everyone knew.<br /><br />The skits are mostly funny, sometimes raunchy, sometimes touching, but
always right on the mark emotionally for that age group.<br /><br />Jason Biggs (Jim) takes the cake (pie) when it comes to comic prowess in
this film.  Alyson Hannigan is priceless as the nerd girl refugee from band
camp.<br /><br />This film is a must see good time.  Check your maturity at the front door
and just enjoy.<br /><br />
