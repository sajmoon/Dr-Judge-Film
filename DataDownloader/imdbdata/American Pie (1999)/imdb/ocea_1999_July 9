1999_July 9 

I was laughing practically from start to finish during this movie.  I had
high hopes of this movie being hilarious and usually I get let down, but
not
this time.  The humor is a little on the twisted side but that is what is
great about it.  Movies before hinted about the subjects but this one
takes
it head on.  There is also a few life lessons hidden behind the humor.  It
is a must see if you like to laugh.
