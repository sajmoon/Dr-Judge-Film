American Pie (1999, Dir. Paul Weitz) <br /><br />Jim, Oz, Finch and Kevin are four friends who make a pact that before
they graduate they will all lose their virginity. The hard job now is
how to reach that goal by prom night. Whilst Oz begins singing to grab
attention and Kevin tries to persuade his girlfriend, Finch tries any
easy route of spreading rumours and Jim fails miserably. Whether it is
being caught on top of a pie or on the Internet, Jim always end up with
his trusty sex advice from his father. Will they achieve their goal of
getting laid by prom night? or will they learn something much
different.<br /><br />Before &#39;American Pie&#39; was released, the amount of sex comedies for
teens was very small. Now, American Pie isn&#39;t just a breakthrough
comedy for its many young stars, but also a breakthrough for sex
comedies. The characters are so lovable and really make you feel
connected to them. The casting choices were spot on. No other actors
could possibly be imagined playing the characters. Everyone can relate
to the characters in some way. There are some great lines in the film,
especially from Eugene Levy, who is the best character of the series.
There are some great gags which can look repulsive too. It&#39;s a
fantastic comedy to watch, but not really the type of film to watch
with parents. Only if they know what goes on in a teens life.<br /><br />&quot;Tell me he did not just get out the chair.&quot; - Finch (Eddie Kaye
Thomas) &quot;He got out the chair.&quot; - Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)
