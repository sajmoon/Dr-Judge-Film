1999_June 24 

Every movie I've seen since Shakespeare in Love has been a disappointment,
but this one is the worst yet. I really expected this to be memorable,
witty
- a satire skewering high school &quot;values&quot;. instead it just reinforced
every
stupid idea and stereotype that I expected it to shoot down. ultimately,
the
moral: even losers get laid, and this makes them, magically, no longer
losers; and, yes, sex is the be-all and end-all.
The movie begins with a masturbation sequence that becomes the motif -
and,
yes, it's funny at first, but how many times can a father realistically
walk
in on his son, and how many different ways can the same gag be repeated
before it gets stale? the majority of the kids in the theater with me
hooted
and screamed just as loudly each time, so i guess i'm in the minority, but
i
got very tired of humor in the form of simple gross-outs.
Don't get me wrong - I thought Something About Mary was hilarious; but
Mary
had a good script, good acting, ingenuity, and an engaging plot. this
movie
has none or very little of the four (with the exception of Natasha Lyonne,
who is above this movie the same way Jeneane Garofolo was above 200
Cigarettes).
If you're looking for a good movie, forget this one. I'll offer an
alternative - just as soon as I can find one myself.
