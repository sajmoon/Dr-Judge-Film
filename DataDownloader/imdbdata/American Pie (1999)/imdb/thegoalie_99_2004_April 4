2004_April 4 

Every man is ashamed to carry the heavy burden of being a vergin.  As men,
we tend to think if we ain't getting, it won't come.  It's this think that
helps make &quot;American Pie&quot; an honest and brutely funny exploitation of what
we'll go through to have sex.  The story's about four friends Jim (the
oustanding Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols), Oz (Chris Klien), and
Finich (Eddie Kaye Thomas).  As the four approach the end of their senior
year, they come to a horrifing realization: they may end up going to
college
as vergins!  It's the taunting of recently defowlered geek Sherman (a smug
Chris Owen) to force the boys into a pact: to lose their verginity by or
at
prom.  So sets in motion the events leading up to the big night.  Each of
the four guys has there own scenario: Kevin is trying to convince long
time
girlfriend Vikki (Tara Ried) that he loves (and he's not lieing either!)
and
it's okay to have sex.  Oz is trying to become a more sensitive guy, which
leads him to &quot;Goody, Goody, Choir Girl&quot; cutie Heather (the adorable Mina
Sivari).  Finich manages to spread rumors throughout school that he
is...um...&quot;gifted&quot;.  And Jim.  Poor Jim.  First, he gets caught watching
porn, then he has an embarissing talk with his father (the brilliant
Eugene
Levy), onstintlly pines over forein fox Nadia (the sexy Shannon
Elizabeth),
And...well I won't spoil it.  Then of course there's Stifler (Sean William
Scott), Oz's jock friend who constantly torments Oz about Heather and
Finich
for...well, just for being &quot;s*** break&quot;.  But of all the girls in this
movie, my favorite is band geek Michelle (cutie Allyson Hannigan), whose
hand with her instament!<br /><br />Looking at all the charecters, its not hard to relate to any of them (for
me, it's the shy, ackward, and neive Jim how I root for).  And that's what
makes this movie great: charecters.  With the exception of Stifler, non of
the guys in the movie are protraid as horny jerks.  Instead, they are so
caught up in the manly image of having sex, that they don't realize till
the
end that it may not that big of deal after all.  In the process, we see
two
male charecters evlove from kids to men.  Oz's realtionship with Heather
helps him to put things in his life into perspective (the lacross/choir
scene is the best example of this).  Kevin's journey is to realize what it
really means to &quot;love&quot; someone (i.e. Vikki).  While Jim and Finich evlove
as
well, it's not with the same depth as Oz and Kevin.  One of the film's
highlights is the father-son relationship with Jim and his father.  While
these are at times halarious, they display the fathers mission: teach his
son the real world of sex.<br /><br />Writer Adam Herz gives the charecters and story a sencere and truthful
outlook on not just sex, but with high school, relationships, and growing
up.  But it's the Weitz bros. who close the ball game.  Refusing to make a
&quot;Farrley Brothers Clone&quot; of a movie, they don't try to make EVERY joke as
discusting as possible (though some are bad).  Also, they don't want it to
seem that the whole world hates the film's heros.  It wants the best for
them and wants them to be happy, but they have to fall on their face once
in
awhile.<br /><br />I do have some complaints about this movie though.  First, I don't like
the
charecter Jessica (Nastasia Lyonne).  Yes, I know she severs as a
confidant
to Vikki, but she just doesn't work for me.  Second, the charecter
Michelle
plays a big role in the movie, so why is she seen so sparingly?  Finally,
the film follows too many &quot;Teen Flick&quot; clichas (thankfully, those doppy
cliches from other movies don't jump to the forefront too
often).<br /><br />But in the end, I have to say that I loved &quot;American Pie&quot;.  It's a crude
comedy with heart, and in ranks as one of my favorite teen flicks (right
behind John Hughes' &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;)
