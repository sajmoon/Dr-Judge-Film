By no means was this a fantastic film, yet it was pretty funny at the same
time. However, if you're strapped for cash and trying to pick and choose
movies to see this summer, you can save yourself admission and just
download
the trailer. There for your eternal viewing pleasure are the funniest
moments of the film. Also from this you can essentially figure out the
entire movie, one of the more predictable in history, before you even set
foot in the theater. All in all, however, a fun movie. 7 out of
10.
