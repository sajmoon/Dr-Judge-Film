2000_February 1 

I just saw the nc-17 version and I am trying to understand what made this
movie objectionable to any audience.  There were a few rather crude scenes,
but nothing we don't encounter everyday on television.  I expected to see a
real skin flick and only saw a short scene with bare breasts.  Ratings
people, get a life....I don't like teen movies where the teens look like
tweens and older.  This film is grossly overrated.  The infamous &quot;Pie&quot;
scene
was a joke.  Does anyone believe that the erection he has is real?
Hollywood relies too much on pseudo-realism and this movie isn't.  There is
no redeeming social value and little entertainment.  I was
disappointed.
