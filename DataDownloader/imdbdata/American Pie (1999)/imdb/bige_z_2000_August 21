Damn I love this movie. Since the first time that I watched it, I still love
it. I probably have seen this movie about 100 times, and i still laugh as
hard as I did the first time that i watched it. The best part of the movie
is when the &quot;Flute Girl&quot; is riding on Jim and says and I quote, &quot; What's my
name B1TCH!&quot; Awww man, that made me bust out with tears of how funny it was.
Damn, if you haven't seen this movie, or you didn't like it, or dont like my
comments, BITE ME! hahahahaha
