1999_July 6 

In a year of- no wait, scratch that- in a decade of major league
disappointments in the genre of teen cinema, Universal Pictures has
finally
delivered a flick that lives up to the standards of such raunchy classics
as
Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porkys.<br /><br />American Pie is a genuinely funny film. While it seems as though most of
the
gross out humor is a blatant result of the success of There's Something
About Mary, the laughs truly are quite original and not forced. The film
is
reminiscent of when John Hughes was writing in his prime in the mid-late
'80s, back when teen comedies actually appealed to teens with true emotion
and hysterics.<br /><br />While the script is very well written, the cast is really the driving
force
behind the film. American Pie would not have been half as funny had there
been &quot;IT&quot; boys and girls such as Freddie Prinze and Jennifer Love in it.
Actors such as Jason Biggs and Natasha Lyonne are the true stars to watch
out for nowadays. The expressions, deliveries, and characterizations are
priceless all around the board. Each individual actor expresses his/her
character with a certain sense of pragmism and originality that it's hard
not to like any one of them.<br /><br />I don't think I really need to discuss the plot or some of the best scenes
in the film because they really have to be seen to be appreciated. Just
make
sure that while going to the local multiplex to catch the latest big
budget
filmmaking disaster of the '90s, you save a little room inside your
cerebrum
of entertainment to catch an outstandingly funny, smart, and emotionally
satisfying flick that might not be sold out on two screens.<br /><br />
