1999_September 5 

At the time at which I write, American Pie has not yet hit the Australian
box office. I, along with a few lucky punters taking part in a promotion,
was pleased to discover that the Mystery Movie at our local cinema was this
film (thank god it wasn't Big Daddy or Deep Blue). Anyway, I remember this
one time, at band camp...<br /><br />What can I say? The whole thing is almost a conglomeration of cliches but
I've studied films in cultural studies that twist familiar things to make
them interesting and original - like American Pie. I think all the 'bad'
guys (Stifler and Sherman) get what's coming to them, as does Jim though
he's actually pleased. Everything works out rather nicely and surprisingly -
I mean, how many people thought things were going to be resolved about
halfway when Finch seemed to have everything under control, Jim has the
Czech girl over his house, Oz had 'won' the girl and Vicky had finally
decided to do it with Kev? But the film ploughed on and these situations
started to change and I was like, so how are Jim and Finch supposed to get
laid now? But with very clever twists it all gets resolved. Love this
resolving that's running rife in movies these days!<br /><br />Well, I must say it was an enjoyable film, utterly hilarious at parts (the
apple pie is just one bit). You gotta love quotes like &quot;Scotch in the
cupboard on the right... aged 18 years - just the way I like it.&quot; (Stifler's
mother) and little things like Jim's 'strip' which almost saved him from
humiliation (the deftly aimed shirt). I'll shut up now. Go and see it or you
won't know what anyone's talking about.<br /><br />I remember this one time, at band camp...
