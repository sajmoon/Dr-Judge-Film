After having read some negative comments about this movie, I was
positively surprised. It would have been easy to make a total fiasco
out of such a movie, but this movie is well balanced and well made. The
characters are likable and the acting good. Some of the gags are
original, and I like the style of humour. It deals with teenage
sexuality without overstepping the line for vulgarity and without being
embarrassing. Another reason I liked it - and the reason for taping it
- is that I hope it can break the barrier when it&#39;s my turn as a father
to explain certain facts of life to my children in a few years. The
movie shows teenagers that it&#39;s normal for everybody to be shy and
awkward when first encountering love and sex, and that those who are
bragging all over the place do it to project a false image. The movie
shows what works and what doesn&#39;t work when looking for a girlfriend,
and that certain pranks that go over the line can have serious
consequences. It also shows teenagers that they are not weirdos if they
have sexual desires or fantasies. That said, not everybody will like
it. Certain will find the humour too gross. Others will find it too
puerile.
