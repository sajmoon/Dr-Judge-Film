1999_July 11 

i just saw the movie today and i loved it... every single minute of it
had
me tear up because the movie is just toooooo damn funny. i was lucky not
to
have seen it with my girlfriend. this movie is best viewed with a couple
of
friends, cause you can laugh harder when your friends are laughing with
you.<br /><br />although this movie is rated R i still think anyone who's in or every
went to high school should see it. this is a movie teens DO NOT WANT TO
MISS. even an old guy (around 40) sitting next to me couldn't stop
laughing.
this movie included every urban legend of teen porn there is. IF YOU THINK
THE PREVIEWS GAVE AWAY TOO MANY GAGS, BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY !YOU HAVE SEEN
NOTHING YET! i will surely see this move again. i'm tired of credic's
opinions.  those old people would rather watch `gone with the wind` FIVE
times than `ace ventura` once, so don't believe them when they say
`american
pie` demoralizes american people... blah blah blah... go see the movie and
all you'll get in return is a great two hours of fun.
