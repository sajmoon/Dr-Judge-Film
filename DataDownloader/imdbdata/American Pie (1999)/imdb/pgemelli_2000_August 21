What are they doing making a sequel to this film.  American Pie was a
classic...our kids will be watching this movie.  Why would they trash a
classic and tarnish its legacy just for some money?  There are no
unanswered
questions from the first movie, and there is no need for more.  American
Pie
II will be one of the worst sequels ever, mark my words.  If you thought
Ghostbusters II was bad, wait for this.  I will see this movie out of
respect for the first one, but I can see the handwriting on the walls.  On
a
good note, there's no way this movie could ever be as bad as &quot;Loser&quot;.
Ouch!
