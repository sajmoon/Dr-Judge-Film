this is the guy equivalent of a chick flick. it's completely self-indulgent
and over the top but in a guy kind of way. it's not a good movie, but it's
great brain candy. it's a 10 if you're looking for a funny, beer-drinking
party movie; it's a 4 or 5 at best if you're looking for something that
makes you think a little and doesn't have a completely predictable ending.
