I really thought this movie was excellent. Now all the outraged parents
that
can hardly believe I am saying this please hear me out.  If you want us
teens to just sit around and pretend we don't know anything and all the
world is just &quot;ducky&quot; fine they we would be lying to you.  American Pie is
a
relality comedy which is very rare. It was so hysterical because it was SO
true.  I had tears rolling down my face from laughing so hard. I would
highly recommend it to everyone who wants a good laugh and to anyone who
is
not embarrassed easily. Just a note: Don't see it with the rents!!!!
