If you don't like this film, you most likely don't like sincerity. This film
is by far the most open-minded film on sex ever made in the
US.<br /><br />Sex in movies instilled moral panic in Sweden in the 50's, and I must say
that the nudity in this one is about as lame as any Swedish film from that
era. The talk isn't much more revolutionary.<br /><br />I laughed my ass off at this movie. It was funny, heart-felt and is probably
a lot more akin to the truth about what's going on inside a high-school
guy's head.<br /><br />What bothers me most is that people tend to think this film actually wants
kids to go on and do it, the quicker the better - don't you get it! It's
irony: I-r-o-n-y, look it up. With that kind of understanding of movies, one
could as well say that every movie about concentration camps tells us to
commit large-scale murder. Strange thinking, or what?
