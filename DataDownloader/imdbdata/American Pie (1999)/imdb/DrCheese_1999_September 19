1999_September 19 

This is truly genuine, sweet-natured comedy under the gross outtakes!  I was
somewhat disappointed that the 'pie' incident  didn't take place on the
kitchen table.<br /><br />Over all Excellent performances by Jason Biggs, Tara Ried, Thomas Ian
Nicolas and the guy named &quot;Oz&quot;!
