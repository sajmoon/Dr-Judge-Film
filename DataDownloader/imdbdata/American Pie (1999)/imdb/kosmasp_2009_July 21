With American Pie a new era of Teen comedies began. In the Porkys
tradition (sort of), this revitalized a sub-genre, that seemed derived
of new ideas. But the mix of characters, their story (promise/oath to
each other) and their embarrassments to achieve said goal(s), a new
breed was born.<br /><br />While the showing of flesh (naked body/ies) seemed to be a problem for
the censors in America, the movie got a &#x22;12&#x22; (equivalent to the PG-13
in America) rating in Germany, in it&#x27;s &#x22;unrated&#x22; form. Some of the
stars seemed to have a bright feature ahead of them, but most of them
didn&#x27;t do anything. The most popular one, although not represented much
in the first installment, was Sean William Scott (aka Stiffler).
Shannon Elizabeth and Co. kind of &#x22;dissapeared&#x22; after a while and don&#x27;t
seem to make many movies nowadays.<br /><br />But that doesn&#x27;t take away the fun that you can have with this movie.
So if you&#x27;re not too prude, just go ahead and watch this. Despite all
the sexual gags, this still got a heart
