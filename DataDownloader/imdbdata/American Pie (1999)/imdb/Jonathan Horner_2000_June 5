I don't know what all the fuss is about &quot;American Pie&quot;. Ok, it's funny in
parts but it's not hilerious. This movie is very over-rated, to be honest, I
found parts of this movie boring, plus some scenes are just too &quot;romantic&quot; I
just wanted to throw up! <br /><br />But American Pie does have it's good points as well. Some scenes are quite
funny (the &quot;Pie&quot; scene) and some scenes make you cringe.<br /><br />This movie is ok but nothing spectacular. Warning never watch this movie
with your parents, it's highly embarrasing.<br /><br />6/10.
