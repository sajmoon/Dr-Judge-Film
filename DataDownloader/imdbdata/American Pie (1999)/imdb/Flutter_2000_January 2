2000_January 2 

Okay - so I admit - it wasn't my first choice movie - I'd gone with a
friend
and missed the start time for the film we'd intended to see.  But who
cared?
American Pie was great - I laughed all the way through.  I'd gone in
expecting to watch a toilet-humour fuelled attack of the teens and came out
thinking I'd finally seen a film which managed to capture the brain
function
of my friends.  It wasn't packed with big-breasted low brain-cell count
girls, and the guys weren't of the all-American type.  I laughed with my
mates, and cried with my date.  What more can you ask?
