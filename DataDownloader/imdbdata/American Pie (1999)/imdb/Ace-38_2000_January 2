&quot;American Pie&quot; starts off with a bang, and gets a bit shaky from there.
This story of five friends who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom
night is often hysterical, occasionally dull, but always
interesting.<br /><br />Jason Biggs leads the cast as Jim, a young man who is growing increasingly
frustrated with being a virgin, and goes to great lengths to lose it.
Let's
face it, this guy is forever going to be remembered for the hysterical pie
scene, but has other embarassing moments as well, either always being
walked
in on by mom and/or dad or a beyond description funny internet snafu.
Great
job by this first timer, and I can't wait to see what he does
next.<br /><br />Chris Klein (&quot;Election&quot;) plays &quot;Oz&quot; as he's called by his friends.....this
mr. popular lacross player is probably the most interesting character in
the
film, with an absolutely adorable characterization.  His attempts to woo
choir girl Heather (Mena Suvari (&quot;American Beauty&quot;) are so sweet and
genuine
that it adds a needed dose of humanity to this otherwise crude
comedy.<br /><br />Since we're on the subject, Mena Suvari plays good girl Heather to the
hilt.
A stellar singer and somewhat distrusting of Oz at first, she eventually
realizes there's more to the boy than first thought, and she falls for him.
This young woman is gonna be around for a long time to come, and is gonna
be
a major player before long.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good, Tara Reid (&quot;Urban Legend&quot;) gets a better
character here, and does a good job, Shannon Elizabeth as the sexy exchange
student Nadia, Eddie Kay Thomas as the nerdy Finch, Seann William Scott as
the rude jock Stifler.  All good characterizations and believeable as
people
you went to or go to school with. Alyson Hannigan (TV's &quot;Buffy&quot;) was easily
the biggest surprise for me, the nerdy character (much like Willow)
suddenly
gives way with THE line in the movie.....towards the end, pay special
attention!!!<br /><br />Two others stood out to me.....Eugene Levy as Jim's dad, hysterical as he
tries to reach out to his son concerning sex.  He is a scene stealer and
was
easily the highlight of the film.<br /><br />The other was Natasha Lyonne (&quot;Slums of Beverly Hills&quot;, &quot;Detroit Rock
City&quot;)
As good an actress as she is, she was woefully underused in this one.  She
rarely is on screen, and is giving advice to the others in short spurts
when
she is.  Ms. Lyonne deserved better than that, and that is my only
gripe.<br /><br />&quot;American Pie&quot; is a good coming-of-age movie for the 90's, but is often
very
off color and crude.  If you're easily offended, try to either avoid this
one or watch it in sections.  If you want a funny teen sex farce, and don't
mind the crudeness, this one is for you!<br /><br />3 1/2 out of 5
