To put it simply, you cannot expect much from this movie. A guy
masturbates with a pie. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve heard anything so
ridiculous, I actually feel dumber just seeing this movie. In my
opinion it is a stereotypical sexually focused movie for teenagers.
There is nothing I did like about this movie, the plot was awful, there
was no character I genuinely liked or could connect with and the humour
was crude and immature. All humour within the movie is focused on sex
or sexual content. In my opinion I can&#x27;t see the hilarity behind
someone wanting to have sex with a food or being walked in while doing
this. The characters and situations which occur are very unrealistic
and I believe this movie is an example of how little creativity and
intelligence people require these days to create or act in a film.
