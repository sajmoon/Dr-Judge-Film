American Pie follows four teens in their senior year of high school.
After experiencing some daunting sexual experiences, they decide to
create a pact that will increase their chances of scoring before the
year ends. The four set a goal to lose their virginity on prom night,
for the sake of their own good.<br /><br />This film has a near-perfect formula &#x96; a variety of characters that are
evident in high schools (making the film easy to relate to), original
and funny jokes that run throughout the entire duration, and an
interesting conflict (if somewhat farcical). Could have been funnier
though. Standout characters in the film are Jason Biggs as the
protagonist Jim, Alyson Hannigan as the geeky Michelle (who has a
hilarious obsession with telling anecdotes about band camp), Seann
William Scott as the high school jock Stifler, and Eugene Levy as Jim&#x27;s
erudite yet slightly dim father.<br /><br />Although the beginning was great, the end was kind of a disappointment.
It was y predictable with what was gonna happen. Everyone watching
knew, they were gonna all end up loosing their vg. Also too much
romance, not enough comedy for me. IMO Superbad was much superior to
this because of the characters, there were many funnier jokes and it
was longer and more realistic. American Pie&#x27;s characters were high
school seniors but they looked way too old (could have passed for
college/university students)...ALL together it was great movie, real
old movie LOLOLOLO
