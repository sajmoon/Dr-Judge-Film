1999_July 29 

Don't worry about the whiners and fears of offense.  This movie has the
right mix of humor and style to guarantee this movie joins the rank of
&quot;Hollywood Nights,&quot; &quot;Diner,&quot; and &quot;Sixteen Candles.&quot; One day you will blow
off a day in the sun just to watch the edited version for twenty minutes or
so for some good ol' laughs at youth and reflections on
innocence.
Can people be serious about not liking this movie?
It has Eugene &quot;Shmengy Brother&quot; Levy for cryin-out-loud.
