How come so many people on here have a bad opinion about this one? i
thought
it was great!! Everything about this movie was great. What a way to finish
off the 90's,with this movie! As far as I'm concerned, this was the
funniest
movie of the decade. I've seen a lot of funny movies, but this one takes
the
cake or pie,whichever you choose. Not to mention that they had some good
looking actors! If you haven't seen this yet, You're missing
out!
