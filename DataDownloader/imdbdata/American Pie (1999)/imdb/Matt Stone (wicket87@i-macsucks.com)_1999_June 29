1999_June 29 

First off, this was one of those movies like Something About Mary...Mainly
filed with gross-out, sex-related humor...THE BEST KIND!!  Around every
corner, this movie surprised the hell out of me...I found myself hooked
after the opening sequence...It was so damn funny and embarrassing.  One
other point that I would like to make about this movie, is that you see
growth in all of the 4 main characters....the most in the jock, Oz...then
Jim, the dork...then Shit-Break, Finch...then the only one w/a girlfriend.
This movie wasn't all humor, and eventually showed you that sex isn't
everything.  At that point you're kinda like wow...neat, and it seems that
the movie is over....but then it goes back to the hilarious, laughing your
ass of humor.  I was fortunate enough to see an early version of this
movie,
and can't wait to see it at theaters, to see if they changed
anything...good
luck, and you haaaaaave to see this movie!!
