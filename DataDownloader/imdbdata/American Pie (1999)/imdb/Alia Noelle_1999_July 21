1999_July 21 

This is quite easily the best movie I've seen all summer. I'm 17 and I
don't
care what anyone says, this movie is real...really funny. Adults can't
quite
grasp the fact that this is what life is like, in fact this movie is only a
tame version of todays teenager. I love it and if you live in the states,
it
is for sure worth sneaking in to, if you are under age.
