But that's only because I've seen some really _bad_ movies lately (like
Jawbreaker).  Much like South Park, this movie will only appeal to those
too
young for its &quot;R&quot; rating.  About the only high point was getting to watch
Alyson Hannigan play a total nutcase.  Otherwise, it was just plain
_bad_.
