1999_August 14 

This movie has to be the most hilarious teen film of all time. Funny
performances and snappy dialog make this a cool movie experience. The best
thing about this movie is that it cast un-known actors and was able to
make
this movie a huge hit.<br /><br />The performances were great. Jason Bigs stands out amongst all of them. He
blends funny dialog with very funny physical comedy. I hope to see him in
more films in the future. Alyson Hannigan who has a small but funny role
is
also great. She says the best line in the movie. ( you have to see it just
to see her say that line)<br /><br />The actors worked exceptionally well together and I really enjoyed the
film.
Go see it.
