I have and enjoy the soundtrack and had high hopes for the movie but I was
really disappointed. It wasn't even particularly good for a teenage
exploitation movie which is hardly a high art genre.  Finally, near the end,
it started to pick up. I guess I'm too old (41) for this kind of movie and
the gross-out jokes were way too much.<br /><br />However, the soundtrack CD is great!
