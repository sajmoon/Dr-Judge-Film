Many horny high school students throughout history have tried to solve the
pie equation. No! Not the 3.14 one, but the one that makes them as
shagadelic as an overmojoed Austin Powers. My friends that would be called
the &quot;American Pie &quot; equation. These and many more hilarious pursuits are
rekindled in a very funny film called ( Yes! You guessed it!) &quot;American
Pie.&quot; This hilarious gem is about four high school students who make a
pact
to lose their virginity by graduation ( or in other words solve the
&quot;American Pie&quot; equation.) The movie contains some outrageous scenes such
as
a powerful laxative that will make you pee in your pants, a new meaning to
the term the world wide web, and a beer that is definitely not less
filling.
To rephrase the great Forrest Gump or in this case I will call him Forrest
Hump- &quot; Life is like an American Pie, you never know how horny is going to
get.&quot;
