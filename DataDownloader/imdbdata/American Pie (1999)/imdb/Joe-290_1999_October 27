1999_October 27 

This film is really funny. Its all that is needed in a good teenage comedy.
Its a hilarious film but just for teenagers. All scenes are very good, well
done and really funny. The scene with the internet is just the best to look
out for. The best for young teens with blazing hormones and the best for
those who love good fun. A great creation and very original but as many
movies will never be a classic. It has nothing much to offer in the world of
movie business but still great fun for anyone young especially. One to
watch. 8 out of 10.
