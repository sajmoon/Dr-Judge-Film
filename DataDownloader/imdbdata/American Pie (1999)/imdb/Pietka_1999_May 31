1999_May 31 

This movie has some dynamite one-liners and running jokes, but don't
mistake
it for a comic masterpiece.  Masturbation gags are good for a few yuks, in
both senses of the words &quot;gag&quot; and &quot;yuck.&quot;  The movie would pretend to
offer
a cross-section of high school life, but rest assured that most of the
nation's youth hasn't de-evolved that far yet.  We may cackle at the jokes
and the opening scene with the scrambled channels strikes home too, but
apple pie is traditionally still a dessert.
