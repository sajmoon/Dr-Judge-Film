1999_July 7 

When I went to see the special sneak prevue, for the movie I knew It was
going to be funny.  I didn't know however, how much I was going to love
that
movie.  Granted a lot of the jokes, are crude, but they made everyone in
the
theater laugh.  That's what a movie is supposed to do, entertain people
and
American Pie did just that.<br /><br />It's more then just a bunch of guys trying to get laid.  It shows how four
very different types of guys come of age, during the last couple of months
of school.  It shows how important friendship is during high school and
even
though girls may come and go, friendship is a very important thing during
your years of high school.  The movie showed that.  The movie was great,
any
on 15 years or older, I would suggest you go out and see this movie,
because
American Pie is a fantastic movie.
