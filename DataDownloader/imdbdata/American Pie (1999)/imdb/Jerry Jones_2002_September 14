*** 1/2<br /><br />Starring: Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Chris
Klein.<br /><br />Four high school students, all still virgins, make a pact that by the end of
graduation, they will get laid.  That is the ingenious plot behind the pie. 
The slice of (McDonald's or Homemade?) pie  delivers fresh and original
laughs, along with the most memorable scene with a striptease and a
pie.
