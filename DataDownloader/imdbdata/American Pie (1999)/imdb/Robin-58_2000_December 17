2000_December 17 

I was surprised to see the amount of negative reaction to this movie. I saw
it, and laughed almost the whole way through. The only problem that I had
was that I couldn't accept the cast as being an average age of around 17,
but then again.....who ever cared that John Belushi was way too old in
Animal House ? My recommendation, by it/ rent it/ relax/ kick back/see it
with a crowd of friends.....it won't change your life, but it'll make you
laugh.
