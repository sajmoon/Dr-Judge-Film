1999_July 5 

It's about time high school is being portrayed as what it is.  People talk
about sex at high school, a lot.  This film is highly realistic in that
aspect.  American Pie is the other side of the coin which is occupied by
Saved by the Bell.  Saved by the Bell deals with the homework, principal,
SCHOOL related issues of a teenagers life, while American Pie deals with
the
sex, beer, LIFE related issues of a teenagers life.<br /><br />This movie is not as funny as There's Something About Mary, but it is
better.  When you watch Mary for a second time and know all the jokes, it
just isn't a good movie.  In Pie, there's a human side to the story which
will pull you back to watch the movie again.<br /><br />Some of the comments here would lead you to believe this whole movie is
about masturbation, but I can only recall two scenes (maybe 5 minutes
tops)
which dealt with masturbation in the entire movie.  I did see a finished
version however, so that may be why.  Definitely a must-see if you can
remember the LIFE related part of high school. 9/10
