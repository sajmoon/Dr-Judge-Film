There's Something About Mary in high school, also read as, &quot;More things I
really don't want to see on a movie screen.&quot;  I'll really be glad when this
current crop of American film-makers grow up.  For that matter, I'll be
happy when the current generations of the American public grow up. 
&quot;America: The Teenage Years.&quot;    What, people are sexual?  Stop the presses.
 Get over it already.  I had no desire to see this movie when it was in
theaters, but kept hearing such good things about it I decided finally to
check it out.  I think I'll go watch The Philadelphia Story again to cleanse
myself.
