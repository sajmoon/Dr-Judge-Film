Firstly, dispel any notion of this being a 'gross-out' teen comedy. Yes,
its' LAUGHS do come from the unending array of compromising situations that
we have ALL been in, but I believe the core of the film is about more than
just cheap gags... In fact, if you look closer and scratch the surface,
you'll see that, like '10 Things I Hate About You' or 'Never Been Kissed',
this is a touching teen rom-com with genuinely intelligent things to say
about the flush of young love and the excitement of first sex. Thankfully,
the genre was followed up by gems true to the ethos like 'Road Trip'.
Sadly,
the movie snobs will forever tar this film with the same brush as the
appallingly awful 'Scary Movie'. Forget about it, guys, this film is more
mature than you might first realise...
