D: Paul &amp; Chris Weiz S: Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie
Kaye Thomas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Seann William Scott, Natasha Lyonne,
Eugene Levy.<br /><br />This is the story of 5 friends, Jim, Oz, Kevin &amp; Finch (Biggs, Klein,
Nicholas, Thomas) who are having trouble getting &quot;Laid&quot;. So one day while
failing to get it at a party, make a promise, to get laid before they
graduate. Now with the help of all 4 of them combined into one try to help
each other get to the promise land.<br /><br />Overall very good for a teen flop around. Jason Biggs is very good as the
incredibly stupid Jim. Though it did push you to the limits on gross out
humor.<br /><br />Co-Starring: Jennifer Coolidge, Chris Owen, Clyde Kusatsu, Lawrence
Pressman.
