1999_July 30 

In a season that has been saturated with nasty humor (&quot;Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; and &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut&quot; being the
chief offenders), the lack of tact in &quot;American Pie&quot; is at least more honest
and justified. This is a fair treatment of American teens, a good
examination of their follies and their virtues and the hormonal imbalances
that taint their relationships. It's also Eugene Levy's best film --
granted, that's not saying much -- and a springboard for Jason
Biggs.<br /><br />A little too much dependency on bathroom humor and intermittent slumps in
the writing put this at a solid 8/10.
