Fed up with their lack of success with the opposite sex, four teenage
boys make a pact to lose their virginity before leaving high-school.<br /><br />In 1999, the teen sex comedy&#151;a genre that had last flourished in the
early to mid-80s&#151;returned with a vengeance when American Pie became a
runaway success at the box office. Directed by newcomer Paul Weitz, and
featuring an almost unknown (at the time) cast, the film had &#39;em
rolling in the aisles thanks to its no-holds-barred, gross-out humour.
Masturbation; oral sex; premature ejaculation; diarrhoea; intercourse
with baked goods; the accidental ingestion of baby gravy: nothing was
considered off-limits to these guys if it had the potential for
hilarity.<br /><br />However, what made American Pie particularly special was that, despite
the fact that the film&#39;s humour consisted primarily of wall-to-wall
vulgarity, it also managed to be kinda sweet in the process. The main
characters, a group of likable high-school geeks who are faced with the
seemingly insurmountable task of getting laid, are not presented as
vacuous ass-holes with one-track minds, but rather as young adults who
are simply coming to terms with the responsibilities and pressures of
adulthood: something that most people have to deal with at some point
in their lives.<br /><br />Of course, from a bloke&#39;s point of view, it doesn&#39;t hurt that the film
also features some rather gorgeous women: Tara Reid is oh-so pretty;
Mena Suvari is doe-eyed and innocent; Shannon Elizabeth is smoking hot
(and nekkid!); and Alyson Hannigan is there for all of those who dig
nerdy chicks. Something for all tastes, it would seem.
