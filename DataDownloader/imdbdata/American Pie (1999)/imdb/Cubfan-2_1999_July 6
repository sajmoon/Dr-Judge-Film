1999_July 6 

Porky's this ain't, even though the subject matter is similar. But the four
guys who want to lose their virginity before graduation in this film are
likeable and real, unlike in the former flick. What's more, it isn't as
crass as it could have been, maybe because the girls here are smarter and
the boys aren't totally without feelings. Other than that, there's no true
redeeming social value, which is all good and well because it's July. It's
also funny much more often than not, and even sweet at the end. One more
thing: Alyson Hannigan steals the show as the dork who's more than she
seems
to be, and the now-famous line involving the flute isn't even her best
one.
