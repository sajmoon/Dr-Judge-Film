American Pie is funny, but this movie was way too over rating. Critics treat
this movie like it was funny as There's Something About Mary. This movie
wasn't that funny.<br /><br />They show so much on the tv commericals which ruined most of the movie for
me. Don't believe the hype, this movie wasn't as funny as the people said it
is. Its not a bad movie overall, but not a good one.<br /><br />**
