American Pie pretty much displays the downfall of society, and I'm
not being iconoclastic about it. How could such a collection of low
brow jokes and bathroom humor be considered entertaining? This
film is nothing more than garbage, which is sad because at least
garbage could be studied in regards to sociological conditions of
familial households. As for this film, I can't find anything remotely
pleasing to say.
