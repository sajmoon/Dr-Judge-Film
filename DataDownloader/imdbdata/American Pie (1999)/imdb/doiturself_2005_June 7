I wasn't sure that I would like this movie because I thought it would
be incredibly dumb. However, I watched it with a friend who saw it and
i couldn't believe how much I laughed. I loved seeing some Waiting for
Guffman and Best in Show alums in the movie. Eugene Levy is a comedic
icon he is truly funny as the all-too understanding father to a
sexually frustrated son. Also Jennifer Coolidge as Stifler's mom...
classic. The only part that really, truly grossed me out to the point
of almost gagging would have to be the infamous pale ale. Just they set
up the perfect build up to the moment. Me and my friend were yelling
back at the scream for him not to drink it every time he would put it
to his lips. Gross. However, this will definitely go in the cadre of my
favorite teen-sex comedies.
