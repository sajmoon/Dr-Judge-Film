This is a fim which doesn't try to prove anything except that laughter is
very good for the soul.  The writing is slick and although oscars may not be
winging their way to the movie, fans will be. Some memorable lines which
kids all across the world will be quoting. Little more can be said as there
is no structure to the genius. The acting is great particlularly Chris
Klein, the running time perfect and the overall mood is sweet. Just like
American Pie.
