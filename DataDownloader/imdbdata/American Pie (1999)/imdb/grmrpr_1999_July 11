1999_July 11 

This movie is by far the best comedy I've seen in 1999.  And it will
pretty
hard to top it.  Gross, but funny and definitely this year's Something
About
Mary.  The second best movie I've seen this year behind GO!.  Phenomenal
acting, dialogue and cinematography made this movie a true treasure to
watch
