1999_July 5 

I went to bed about two hours after coming home from a sneak peak of
AMERICAN PIE, and my stomach still ached -- not from some of the gross-out
bits, but from laughing so hard at them.<br /><br />The acting in this film is brilliant -- everyone plays their characters to
a
T.  The fact that the actors had a good script helped,
too.<br /><br />My only complaints about it are that it:
1) the first half is a little slow
2) at times, it becomes too much of a teen-exploitation, i.e. SHE'S
ALL
THAT, CAN'T HARDLY WAIT.  But then again, this delves deeper than SHE &amp;
CAN'T ... perhaps after a second viewing will I up my ranking of this film
to 9.<br /><br />But, without question, this deserves to be high up on your Things To Do
List.
