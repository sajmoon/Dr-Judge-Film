Even without referring to the 'pie' incident, this is one hilarious movie.
Somehow, the acting and antics of the actors and actresses manage to
convince me that they are 16 and not in their 20's. Though I couldn't
remember doing all those things in the movie just to get sex, I can imagine
what 'desperate' teenagers would do to get it. Some of the ways they thought
of weren't available at my time (eg, web cam), but I was sure hoping they'd
succeed. :) While you won't call this a great movie - it is after all a teen
flick appealing to hormonal teenagers - it is still a great movie to watch
and enjoy, especially, I guess, if you are a young couple.
