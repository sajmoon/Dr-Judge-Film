Be warned, American Pie is a romantic comedy with its heart in its dick,
but
it is throughly enjoyable and extremely hilarious.<br /><br />American Pie (1999) follows the story of 4 sex-obsessed teenagers who are
desperate to get laid. So they make a pact that they must lose their
virginity before they graduate. On the way to doing it, the guys have
hilarious problems, including broadcasting themselves naked on the
internet,
f**king a pie and several others!<br /><br />American Pie is a 1999 must-see!!<br /><br />Oh, also, look out for Alyson Hannigan (Buffy), Tara Reid (Urban Legend,
Cruel Intentions), Mena Suvari (American Beauty) and Chris Klein (Here on
Earth, Election) - they are all really good actors.
