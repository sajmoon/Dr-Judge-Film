1999_July 28 

I laughed TWICE during this movie. TWICE! All the funny parts were in the
trailer. Don't get me wrong- I'm totally down for a good teenage sex comedy
with gratuitous nudity and assorted hijinks. But this had to be one of the
most haphazardly written, badly directed flicks I've seen in a while. The
situations made no sense, neither did the characters. The actors (save for
Chris Klein) were annoying and embarrassing. The whole flick seemed like it
was written on the back of cocktail napkins. And what was with all the
sappiness? Give me a break-- and give me ELECTION-- or even UP THE CREEK any
day. ** out of ****
