Being somewhat cautious about watching this film due to the
overhyping of the extremely poor blairwitch project , i did feel
the americans were going to do it again . Laud about something
that really doesn't deserve it . I was wrong , this film was
easily the funniest film i had seen this year and lived up to
all the hype i had heard . Although the humour was smut riddled
and the toilet based humour was putting There's something about
mary to shame , the whole film worked and certainly gave us a
Porky's or Screwballs for the millenium . The actors carried
their parts of with ease and gave the viewer a squirm factor not
felt for a long time . Nothing more to say except for we want
