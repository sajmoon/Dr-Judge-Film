1999_July 14 

One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Absolutely worth the cost of
admission. Although the humor is vulgar and sophomoric, that is the whole
point, and it is creatively and and well done. American Pie is an all
around
fun movie to see, and as long as you aren't expecting anything deep or
profound, you will leave the theater with a smile on your face, and
something to laugh about for the rest of the evening.
