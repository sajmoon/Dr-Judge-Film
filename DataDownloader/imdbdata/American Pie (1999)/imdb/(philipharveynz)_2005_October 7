I watched and loved this when it came out, I remember it being side
splitting funny. Now re-watching watching it 6 years later while in my
30s I was pleasantly surprised that it hadn't lost it's charm, and the
jokes were still funny. I didn't split my sides like I did the first
time but that's often the case when you have high expectations. Yes
much of the jokes are gross out, but not to the extent of the films
that followed that really have taken it too far. The dialogue is well
written and in many cases rings true from my experiences at high
school. Tthere are very few jokes that miss the mark, and the sound
track is great as well. Highly recommended.
