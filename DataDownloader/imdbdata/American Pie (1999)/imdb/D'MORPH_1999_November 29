1999_November 29 

Had lots of funny bits that I laughed at.(I'm kind of partial to toilet
humour!!!) Some parts were rather unnecessary (cheetah-gal in main
character's bedroom naked) but overall this flick was probably the best
laugh I've had for a while, since seeing 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me'. <br /><br />If you want to laugh at the rediculous antics of sexually frustrated young
males still living at home with their Olds, this movie is a Must
See!!!
