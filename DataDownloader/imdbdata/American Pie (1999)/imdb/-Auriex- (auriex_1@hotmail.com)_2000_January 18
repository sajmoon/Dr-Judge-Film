I first saw this movie as it was probably intended to be viewed -- sitting
in a room with a few of my male college friends.<br /><br />For the film itself, I feel that it speaks true to a lot of the stereotypes
portrayed in many peoples minds.  Talking to a few of the people that have
seen the film, they usually touch on the point of how they feel that the
&quot;High-school&quot; theme was
extremely exaggerated throughout the movie.  I would agree with that to an
extent, though I do believe that a lot of the underlying principles
portrayed in the film strike at the heart of what high-school does to the
mentality of some of the kids there.  That they only touched on one of the
aspects of our glorious education system...<br /><br />But my small rant is over -- and to sum up, I truly enjoyed this film and
would recommend it to any that feel they can handle it's mature content.  I
don't need to delve in to what I mean by 'mature content'; most of the
people that went to see this movie already knew what the main climactic
scene in it was.<br /><br />9 out of 10<br /><br />
