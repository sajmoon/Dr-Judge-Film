American Pie was the funniest movie of the summer.  While its humor was as
disgusting and inappropriate as any other movie released in the past
years,
it delivered with the laughs needed to make it not seem to matter.  While
I
don't think this movie is appropriate viewing material for people under
16,
I found myself laughing harder than I have in years.  While character
development and casting could be found as a small problem, overall the
characters were much better casted and acted than any of the other teen
flicks.  American Pie was a real laugh, and the humor was as below the
belt
as it gets.
