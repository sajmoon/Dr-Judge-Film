In American Pie, the frat-boy, gross-out humor gets laughs, but not because
of any especially clever writing. It gets our attention by saying things
we've seldom heard on screen before. They had to outdo THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT MARY, right? One movie's hair gel puts head on another movie's beer.
It's PORKY'S for the new millennium. The simple story has four high school
friends with hormones raging, obsessing about sex. How to lose one's
virginity before prom night, only two weeks away? Get busy, guys.<br /><br />Jim, who has been interrupted by his father while putting a tube sock to new
use, has few romantic prospects. Kevin seems to be better positioned as he
already has a girlfriend, albeit one who's keeping her thighs wide shut. Oz
is a handsome lacrosse player who decides that being sensitive will help him
make the score. Finch is so uptight that he must go home to go to the
bathroom, but gets the help of a co-ed in spreading rumors of his generous
endowment. Will they or won't they? Therein lies the obvious rub. The girls
in PIE are given more dimension than the standard for juvenile sex comedies,
which is some sort of progress. The fresh cast is quite agreeable,
especially Shawnn William Scott as Stiffler and Natasha Lyonne from THE
SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS. Eugene Levy performs a marvelously deadpan cameo as
Jim's clueless father.  <br /><br />Remember to keep your eyes on the flute.
