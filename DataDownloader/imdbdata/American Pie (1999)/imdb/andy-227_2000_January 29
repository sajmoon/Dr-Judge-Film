2000_January 29 

After all the hype and the amount of recommendations from people who said
this was a great comedy, my friends and I rented &quot;American Pie&quot; to see if it
lived up to the hype.  You know what, it did.  &quot;American Pie&quot; had us
laughing our asses off from start to finish.  Others have said it's not
funny because it's stupid and raunchy, but the stupidity and raunchiness of
it is what made it soar.  Laughter is always the best medicine, and
&quot;American Pie&quot; succeeds in giving us a double-dose!  None of us had seen it
before, and we were lucky enough to have rented the Unrated version first. 
We got to see, in full effect, the version of &quot;American Pie&quot; the filmmakers
wanted us to see.  There's not many differences between the two
versions(after reading about them on the internet of course), except the
largely talked about &quot;pie&quot; scene, which was pretty sick.  Still, to be
frank, I thought that the Unrated version couldn't be any raunchier than R
rated version.  It's silly how protective the MPAA feels they have to act
for us.  I don't know.  People complain that this isn't any funnier, better,
or sicker than stuff like &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;.  I was satisfied with &quot;American
Pie&quot;, and I thought it was very funny.  Go rent it, and rent the Unrated
version.  That's the &quot;American Pie&quot; the world was supposed to
see.
