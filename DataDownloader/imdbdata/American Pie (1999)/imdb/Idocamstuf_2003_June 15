This comment is mostly for Roger Ebert and that James Bertinelli guy.  It's
very interesting that most of the big critics liked this movie, I found it
to be one of the most insulting, unfunny pieces of trash ever made, with no
redeeming qualities.  There is one funny scene, the one where they give the
kid the exlax, and that is it, as good as it gets.  It just dont get it, I
thought &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; was a classic comedy, it had a plot, many, many
laughs, and some heart, but this had none of that, and its considered a
classic, I dont think so.  2 out of 10.
