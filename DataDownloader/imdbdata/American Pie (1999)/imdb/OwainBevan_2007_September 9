Ordinarily, I avoid American teen movies like the plague. But a good
movie is a good movie, and this is one of the best examples of this
normally obnoxious genre. Its basic premise &#150; a group of high-school
leavers endeavour to lose their virginity before setting off for
college &#150; is a fairly simple one. It is in the quality of the comedy
and (some) of the central characters that sets American Pie apart. The
story centres on Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) and his attempts to get
beautiful exchange-student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) into bed. The best
supporting roles (and side stories) come from the high-brow (and
slightly pretentious) Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Steve Stifler
(Seann W. Scott) who both provide additional colour and depth to
proceedings. To be frank, I found Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin&#39;s (Thomas
Ian Nicholas) stories to be fairly bland affairs, straight out of a
teen magazine (they were virtually redundant in American Pie 2). With
its American college rock soundtrack and its almost National Lampoon
mindset, American Pie does feel a little dated today. Nevertheless, it
contains enough quality to make it worth a viewing.<br /><br />Owain Bevan
