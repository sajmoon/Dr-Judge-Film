This movie is absolutely terrific!  It is full of laughter and classic
moments and will leave you p***ing your pants!  The characters are
extremely
lovable and realistic and the film captures the moments of first time
expreriences perfectly.  Definitely a must see for all teenagers and
definitely worth a look a second, third, fourth and so on
time!
