1999_June 23 

Not only is this the funniest movie of 1999 (Austin Powers was good, but
not
this good), but you leave with a good feeling after watching it.  All the
performances were solid, given the material they covered.  And even though
the film revolves around teen-agers, I think you have to be in your
twenties
to truly appreciate the characters' take on their dilemma.  What also
impressed me was how the pop music in the background fit each scene
accordingly in tempo and mood.  Some people may be put off by some of the
sight gags, but that's why it's rated R.
