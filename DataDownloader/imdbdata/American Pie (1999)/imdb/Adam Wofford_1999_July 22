1999_July 22 

This movie is the funniest movie I've ever seen for one simple reason -- it
takes a realistic look at what being a high schooler was like and adds in
some outrageous situations.  The candid dialogue and physical comedy are
tops.  A+ performances by all the fresh new cast and a great script make
this teenage story far from a &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;....  Everyone who is in, or
remembers what high school was like MUST see this movie [but don't take the
kids].
