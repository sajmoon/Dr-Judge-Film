1999_July 19 

I originally went to this movie because I wanted to see Jason Biggs act. If
I went again, it would be because I loved the movie itself. It's more than
just a shock-show of toilet humor. It's actually full of lessons on life and
love. I was pleasantly surprised at Oz(Chris Klein)'s transformation. I
laughed and nodded my head at the heroes' mistakes. I could empathize with
them. Although it's naturally a little exaggerated, being a comedy and all,
it's pretty honest about what goes on in high school. And more than making
me laugh, it made me think. It doesn't hurt that just about all the actors
were stunningly good-looking either. :) I definitely recommend this movie
for parents as well as teens over 16. You'll love it and learn from
it.
