People say American Pie is a &quot;movie teens will enjoy and will think it is
hillarious.&quot;  Well...I am 17 years old and I somehow did not laugh once. 
This movie is awful.  It is beyond awful.  Who the heck wrote this garbage??
A horny 17 year old guy??  Oooh lets see who could lose their viginity
before graduation!!  If we go to College and we are virgins we are losers!!!
Give me a break!!  If people have to write a teenage sex comedy, the least
they could do is write and intellegent teenage sex comedy..but I don't think
Hollywood is capable of doing such a thing.
