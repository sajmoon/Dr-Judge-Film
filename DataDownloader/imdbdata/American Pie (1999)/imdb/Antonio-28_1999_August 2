Excellent movie.
Though initially suspicious of this movie (how can a stupid Hollywood comedy
about high school kids be any different
than all others), I ended up delighted. This is something different. What
makes the film great is an excellent cast (the youngsters from this film are
unbelievable) and the absence of that stupid consumer-society predictability
that colors all
those commercial Hollywood productions. The extent of predictability still
found here is excused by our sympathy to
the protagonists and so familiar troubles they go through.
A thumb up. Bravo!
