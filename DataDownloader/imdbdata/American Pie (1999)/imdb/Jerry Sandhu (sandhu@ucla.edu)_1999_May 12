American Pie is what great teen films should be and what they once were.
In
a time when lame films like She's All That and Varsity Blues portray teens
in an unrealistic and insulting fashion, American Pie gives an honest look
at teenagers and their thoughts about sex.  However, not only are the
characters actually believable as typical teenagers, but the movie
presents
itself an a hilarious fashion.  This movie contains some of the crudest
jokes I've seen, but they all work, and it's actually plausible that
teenagers might do these things.  The acting and dialogue are questionable
at times, but one thing is for sure--this movie is filled with non-stop
laughter.  For once a (teen) movie that is 1) realistic 2) filled with
jokes
that actually make you laugh out loud and 3) enjoyable for both teens and
adults...just don't watch this with your parents.  As a teenager myself, I
haven't laughed this hard since There's Something About Mary, I don't plan
to again all year.  Sex, nudity, and countless masturbation jokes, what
else
could you ask for in a movie?
