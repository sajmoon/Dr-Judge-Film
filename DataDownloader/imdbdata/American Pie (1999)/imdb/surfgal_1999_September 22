American Pie has got to be the funniest movie ever made. I thought Happy
Gilmore was but this movie just kicks arse!!!! It has the spunkiest bunch of
blokes ever- Oz, Jim and Kevin. I walked out of the cinema totally in love
with the guys and still in tears from some of those scenes like the first
sock scene, the pie scene and the music scene where Oz says &quot;it came from
the heart&quot;. The story line is very clever and everyone involved with the
film should be proud. Ever since i saw it 3 days ago all the punch lines
have been going through my head and all my friends keep talking about it and
we laugh ourself silly. I loved it so much that i am going to see it again
and again and as soon as it comes out on video i am buying it. Everyone go
out and see it because it is the best movie i have ever seen.....shocking
and graphic but excellent.
