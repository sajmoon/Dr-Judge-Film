1999_May 14 

If you think this movie is one that is only intended for the &quot;hip&quot; teen
audience...think.  This movie offers some great laughs and good acting.
The
cast is basically made up of unknown teen actors (except for Natasha
Lyonne
and the girl who plays Willow on Buffy).  There are many great one-liners
and it's packed full of hysterical situations.  From reviews that I have
seen of this movie, a lot of people are comparing it to Fast Times at
Ridgemont High.  I would say it's more like a Something about Mary about
the
teen dating scene rather than about thirtysomethings.  Anyone who
appreciates good comedy and gutter humor should definitely see this
movie.
