1999_July 12 

This film had us laughing from the beginning to the end.  In fact, out of
all the films we have seen this year, including Analyze This and Election
(both very good), American Pie is the funniest hands down.  Not as clever
as
Election, but hysterically funny.  Jason Biggs (Jim), Chris Klein (Oz) and
Eugene Levy (Jim's father), were particularly good.
