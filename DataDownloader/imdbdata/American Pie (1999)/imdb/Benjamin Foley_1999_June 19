Four Young men explore the wonders and challenges of sex in this comedy
about growing up. The story follows these men as they make a pact to loose
their virginity before graduating high school and quickly learn that it is
easier said than done.<br /><br />American Pie is a very raw and graphic film and can be disturbing at
times. For most young adults the movie will come off as hilarious and good
while most adults will find it repulsive and degrading. I sat in a theater
between two other critics from another local media firm and a group of
recent high school graduates. While one group cringed at the raw nature of
the story the other cheered and yelled profusely. The movie completely
butchers the idea of &quot;love&quot; and pushes on the idea of sex rules all. This
movie will be a huge success among the young and a huge point of argument
among the adults. If you have a week stomach i would not recommend this
movie under any circumstances. On a scale from 1 to 5 tickets I would give
this movie a 5 just because it depends on your age and maturity level
whether you will like this movie or not.
