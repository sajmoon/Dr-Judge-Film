American Pie lives up to its intriguing television previews and movie
trailers. American Pie brings back the Teen Sex Comedy genre that defined
1980s cinema. Crude, loud, blunt and shockingly hilarious. The critics
will
hate it, the cynics will condemn it, but no matter what anyone says,
American Pie is a movie that passes boundaries. It lacks inhibitions which
makes it even better. I loved it.
