I went to see American Pie when it came out during the summer.  Boy, I
wish
I hadn't.  It took me right back to the place I didn't want to be:High
School.  It's not the bittersweet lamentation kind of high school movie.
It's a movie that will make you think of all the jackasses you had to
spend
180 days with year in and year out.  Bad stuff.  Rent &quot;Election&quot;
instead.
