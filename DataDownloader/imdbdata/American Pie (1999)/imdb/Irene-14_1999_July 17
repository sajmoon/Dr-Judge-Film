If you can get a really big laugh out of toilet humor, and these 4 guys
escapades to get laid, then this is the movie for you.  I went to see this,
and it was excellent.  Yet, I'm in High School, and have a very simple mind.
It starts out with these guys, who, after a party where the testosterone is
in overdrive, decide to create a pact to get laid before graduation, and
they decide that prom night is the lucky night.  Each one has their own idea
of how to get a hottie in bed. One draws to their sensitive side, another
tries to get anything in any way possible, and is afraid.  It goes on that
through their &quot;journey&quot;, there are trials and obstacles, and on prom night
everything goes crazy.  They each go with their dates to a party afterwards,
and it is there that &quot;It&quot; happens.  My favorite character has to be the band
nerd (because I am one myself) who starts everything with something from
band camp.  We are too alike, and that really frightens me, but for the
twisted and strange people of the world, this is our movie.
