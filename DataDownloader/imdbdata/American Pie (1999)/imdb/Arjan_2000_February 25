2000_February 25 

I actually saw the movie one hour ago and I am not that enthusiastic about
it. Maybe it was the people I saw the movie with; 15-year olds, young
couples in love, screaming and playing with their cell-phones... Or maybe it
was just the movie.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I am not THAT old, I am 22, but the movie was full of
cliche-jokes and morals. The moral maybe was the most annoying part of the
movie: it is love that counts, not sex, blah, blah, blah, yada, yada,
yada.<br /><br />Come on: this is a TYPICAL American comedy... like we've seen zillions of...
I am not even gonna sum them all up.<br /><br />Anyway... some parts were nice like the whole thing with the dad (the flick
made such an impression on me I even forgot most of the character's
names).<br /><br />But there were some promising young actors in the move. One of them I
remembered from 'American Beauty', Mena Suvari (geeze what is her next move
going to be called...? it must start with 'American' that's for
sure).<br /><br />It was amusing but only occasionally. It was surely predictable as well as
too moralistic (as I mentioned before). I hope you Americans with the number
one country on teenage pregnancies and the hatred against gay people would
look better on European movies and stop making these moralistic nothings.
This is the year 2000 for crying out loud! Stop the double standards and
hypocricy... but you are nice people.... don't get me wrong...<br /><br />I'd say: a 6 out of 10...
