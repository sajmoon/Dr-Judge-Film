I haven't seen a trashy American high school comedy as good as this one
since the mid 1980's, and this sort of humour has made a welcome comeback!<br /><br />Think of &quot;Bachelor Party meets National Lampoons Animal House&quot; and you will
end up with American Pie.  If vulgar humour is your thing, you will split
your sides with laughter - American Pie has some of the funniest scenes ever
seen.<br /><br />Sheer class.
