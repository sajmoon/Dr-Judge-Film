The first time I saw this movie I thought it was the best movie ever. But
when I saw it for my second time (on video), I was really disappointed.
Don't get me wrong... this still is a very good movie. I think I just got my
hopes up about it being as good the second time around. I'm a big fan of
teen movies, and this one is a good watch.
