1999_August 1 

What could have been an incredible and insightful teen comedy/coming-of-age
story flounders due to poor execution.  While there is a larger amount of
content and insight than usual for these kinds of movies, the majority of
the humour is lost as the timing for almost all the jokes falls completely
flat.  At least the characters are strong enough to make the movie
interesting, but good characters alone do not make a good
film.<br /><br />Final score is 3/5; it is redeemed somewhat by the amount of insight, but
that still doesn't quite manage to get it where it should
go.
