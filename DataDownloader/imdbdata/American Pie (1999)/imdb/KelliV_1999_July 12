1999_July 12 

American Pie is a great sex comedy.  I would have to agree with another
critic in saying that you can't truly appreciate this film unless you're
past all that (ie., high school).  I also think that you can't really
appreciate this unless you spent all four years of high school in the 90s.
This film plays on the &quot;hang-ups&quot; that are trademarks of the time.... the
pressure to get laid, masturbation, the use of the internet and other
technology, etc.  The shock value in this film was amazingly high, which I
thought is what made the film what it is.  It was a great parody of what
the
general public thinks of high school nowadays.
