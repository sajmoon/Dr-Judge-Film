1999_September 19 

If only I had seen this film when I was in high school.  I haven't laughed
so much, and have had a movie I could relate to so much since &quot;There's
Something About Mary&quot;.  However, this movie is not for everyone.  I got the
feeling that this film is dedicated to all the teens out there who are dying
to get laid, and haven't got a clue how to go about it.  This film brought
me back to my high school days, and made me wish I was in my senior year
once again.  If only I knew then what I know now.  If you want to relive
your teenage days - go and see this film.
