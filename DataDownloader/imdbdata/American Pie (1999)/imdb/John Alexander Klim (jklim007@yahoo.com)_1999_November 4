1999_November 4 

Frustrated and thirsty for sex, four Michigan high schoolers make a pact to
lose their virginity by the time of their senior prom. Hysterically and
boldly funny, American Pie brakes new boundaries in the field of raunchyness
portraying scenes of masturbation, strip teases, father-son talks and more
masturbation. Hilarious from start to finish with great character portrayals
of a high school jock, an elegant neat freak who hates to use public
toilets, the school &quot;sextololist&quot;  and a nervous/curious American teen who
longs for the next step. With a killer soundtrack to boot including songs
from the late '90s, Pie is a must see because I think we all have been in
their shoes...
