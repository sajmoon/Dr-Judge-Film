American Pie was a great movie, I was really surprised by it. Alyson
Hannigan (Michelle) was amazing even though she had a small part. Jason
Biggs was also hilarious. I was afraid the movie would be cheesy, but
instead it was funny, raunchy,honest, and intelligent.  It was one of the
best movies this summer.
