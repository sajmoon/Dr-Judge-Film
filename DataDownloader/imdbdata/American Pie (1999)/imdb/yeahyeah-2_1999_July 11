This is a definitely favorite for anybody that enjoyed There's Something
About Mary.  But, even more than that, this movie is about high school,
and
how we all were and are.  The comedy is raunchy, but amazingly believable
and funny.  The characters are very well developed and represent all the
people from high school.  American Pie will truly go down as one of the
classic high school movies and as one of the big hits of this
summer.
