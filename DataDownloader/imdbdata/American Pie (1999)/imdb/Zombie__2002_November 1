I laughed more when i saw Philadelphia. When you're 6 you have poop and
p***
humor, when you're a teenager you have sex and semen humor(apparently...),
only if you're an oblivious, obnoxious, immature, sex crazed teenager can
you find humor in a scene where a guy has &quot;sex&quot; with a pie. Even I'm 17
and
cant for the life of me understand how anyone can find this movie amusing.
Except teenage boys(and confused middle aged men) who likes to look at
half
naked teenage girls, or women in their late 20's playing
teenagers.<br /><br />basically its a movie about a group of teenagers who wants to lose their
virginity before they graduate high school. What perverted hollywood
executives came up with that idea?? Stupid plot, stupid movie. Who
could've
guessed? Don't waste your time, money, sanity on this what i fear will
become an American cult movie in 10 years.<br /><br />I pray that one day a director will update the concept of &quot;teen movies&quot;,
movies that will actually portray how it is to be a teenager. I cant
relate
to this movie even SLIGHTLY and I'm guessing neither can any other
teenager.<br /><br />2/10
