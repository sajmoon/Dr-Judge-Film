1999_July 10 

This was not the amazing comedy that it boasted to be.  It was very funny
and had the lewd humor to it that was expected from it's previews but it
had
more depth to it.  An actual crafted plot.  What really saved the movie
for
me was that at the end the boys realized that sex wasn't all as important
as
they were making it out to be and called the pact off - then all went and
had sex anyway.  I really liked the mini lesson on how you can never
really
prepare - it should just happen.  The montage at the end was beautifully
crafted.  This is a funny date-movie.  There are some pretty gross
sections
in the movies - but you'll see them coming, it's just waiting for them to
happen is what it is all about.  Eugene Levy was excellent in this as the
Dad who wants to tell his son and seem cool at the same time.  Although
highly unrealistic at times the film showed some the morals that all
movies
about students should - I'm not going to say what they are - you'll have
to
find them for yourself.
