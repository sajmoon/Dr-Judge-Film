1999_July 19 

Seriously, this has to be the funniest film I've ever had the privilege of
watching. There's not one dead spot, plenty of characters that get fleshed
out (pardon the pun) very thoroughly, and some scenes that will go down in
teen-comedy history. (The pie, of course...) A good bit of the humor is
low-brow, and nearly all of it revolves around sex, so I wouldn't recommend
taking the littlest of the little kids to this. But for adults of virtually
any age this is a sure ticket. What a riot! This puts &quot;There's Something
About Mary&quot; completely to shame.
