American Pie is my number 21 movie. The first time I saw it I did not like
it that much, I just found it was quite amusing. But the second time I could
almost not stopped laughing, because I noticed all those jokes that are in
there. And there are many of them. I almost have to like this movie, since I
am a 17 years old guy, and I love it. It maybe is one of the funniest movies
I have ever seen, featuring one of my favorite characters : Jim played
hilariously by Jason Biggs. I heard that there will a second American Pie. I
am really looking forward to it, and I hope it won't be less funny.<br /><br />Good points : Jason Biggs, many different characters, the girls, story, hope
for a sequel, comedy, beginning, ending, soundtrack, score, ideas,
screenplay,<br /><br />Bad points : sometimes to emotional, I think<br /><br />All in all, I rate American Pie 9.5/10 and recommend it to comedy fans. It
is one of the greatest that there is. See it!!!  <br /><br />CU; Rinho.
