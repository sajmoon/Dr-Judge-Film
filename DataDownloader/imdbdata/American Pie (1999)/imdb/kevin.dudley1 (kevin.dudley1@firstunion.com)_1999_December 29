1999_December 29 

rented both the unrated and r-rated versions with some friends just to
compare and was extremely suprised. the pie scene in the unrated version
(which had him laying on the breakfast bar on top of the pie) seemed less
risque than the r version in which he was standing up and the pie was
hanging off of him after his dad caught him. other than a couple of
different camera angles, there was hardly nothing different. i actually
found the r rated version to be slightly better.
