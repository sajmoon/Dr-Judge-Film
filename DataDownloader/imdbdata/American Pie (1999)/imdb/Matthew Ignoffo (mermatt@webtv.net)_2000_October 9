I have to admit that while this comedy is adolescent and raunchy, I loved it
and saw it several times. Then I bought the DVD and listened to the
commentaries. If a teen sex comedy can be a classic, this is it. The
outrageousness is done so offhandedly that you just have to
laugh.<br /><br />The talented young cast does a delightful job with the material, making this
the third part of a truly strange trilogy that also includes the weird
AMERICAN PSYCHO and odd AMERICAN BEAUTY. The three films together pretty
much define America at the turn of the 21st Century -- heaven help
us!<br /><br />The film is as American as the apple pie which is raped so blatantly. Pity
the poor pie -- and then laugh yourself silly.
