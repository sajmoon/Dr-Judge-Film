A group of high school students (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian
Nicolas and Eddie Kaye Thomas) are trying desperately to lose their
virginity at their prom night. But each student have different
experiences with the relationship... they have with their girlfriends
or the young woman... they encounter. But none of them... realized that
losing their virginity and especially growing up is tough.<br /><br />Directed by Paul Weitz (About a Boy, Down to Earth, In Good Company)
made an hilarious coming of age teen comedy about growing up maturely
and sex. This was the first film to make sex, just as hip for the young
girls instead of the usual horny teen boys. The young cast are
especially good but Eugene Levy as one of the boy&#39;s father has some of
the funnier moments in the film.<br /><br />DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good
Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This DVD is the unrated version. DVD
has an hilarious commentary track by the director, screenwriter Adam
Herz, actors:Biggs-Kaye Thomas and Seann William Scott. DVD also has
behind the scenes featurette, outtakes and more. This was one of the
most successful comedies of 1999, it was so popular and well received.
There was two successful sequels were produced in 2001 and 2003.
&quot;American Pie&quot; is certainly one of the funnier sex comedies since
&quot;Porky&#39;s&quot; but this movie has an bigger heart and it is more realistic
as well. Don&#39;t miss it. (****/*****).
