What a colossal waste of time this piece of refuse was!! If you are
interested in seeing every bodily function performed, this is your movie.
Let's see... We had saliva, urine, vomit, bowel movements, and semen.  We
also had zero character development, juvenile plot exposition, and every,
I
mean every teen movie cliche imaginable.  We had the Mrs. Robinson effect,
the jock plays sensitive, the sex wagering, the ragging on nerds, the
elitist scotch drinking teen, the bumbling parents, the drunken divorce,
band nerds, etc.  Come on Hollywood, this movie stunk.  I am quite sure 13
and 14 years olds will love this stuff, but no one else should.  Ignore
those who think this is the best movie of the year or some classic
throwback
comedy. It is certainly not.
