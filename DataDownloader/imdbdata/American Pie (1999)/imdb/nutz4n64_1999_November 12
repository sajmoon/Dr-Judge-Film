1999_November 12 

The past two summers have been very good to me movie-wise.  &quot;American Pie&quot;
was by far the best movie of the summer of '99.  There was barely a moment
when I could stop laughing.  And the pie scene (I'm sure everyone knows
what
I'm talking about there)makes the &quot;Something About Mary&quot; hair gel scene
look
like something out of a Walt Disney movie.  Do not miss this
one.
