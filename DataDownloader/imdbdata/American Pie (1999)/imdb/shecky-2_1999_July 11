Okay, I've never seen Porky's.  Not on video, I've seen it on TV.  Every
reviewer in the country is calling American Pie &quot;rehashed Porky's.&quot;  And
yeah, it might be, but who cares?  It's a new generation, and, to be quite
honest, American Pie was good.  Damn good.  Entertaining and
everything.<br /><br />What distinguishes American Pie from other high school comedies?  There's
no
unlikeable characters.  It gives you such a great feeling because you've
known the characters in the movie when you were in high school.  The
characters do what you expect them to do.  When Jason Biggs' character has
a
naked girl in his room, you yell at the screen for him to go to her, just
like his friends persuade him to do.<br /><br />The dorky guy that you know is lying about having sex, the butthead
athlete
that you like because he's so funny and stupid, the pretty cool athlete
that
straddles being king of the school and being himself, the guy who is just
obsessed with sex, the dorky guy that hangs out with the semi-popular
click,
the couple that has been dating forever but aren't having sex, the chick
that is so smart about life, the band geek that's got a wild streak.
These
are all characters we've known, and that's why it's easy to relate to
them.<br /><br />The power of American Pie is that it is not an artistically done movie,
and
it doesn't try to be.  It knows it's not going to win any awards.  It is a
low-budget comedy with Eugene Levy that's main purpose for existence is to
entertain.  And really, isn't that what all films should do?
