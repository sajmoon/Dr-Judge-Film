Much better than the usual teen-sex-glitz-farce. I watched the unrated
version of &quot;American Pie&quot; on DVD the same week I also watched &quot;10 Things I
Hate About You,&quot; and the contrast between the two was clear. Both movies are
a little gross for some tastes, and probably will concern or even offend a
portion of the population. But beyond that kind of knee-jerk &quot;tut-tutting&quot;
in the media there is a very good reason to enjoy &quot;American Pie&quot;: It's a
very good movie.<br /><br />I avoided &quot;American Pie&quot; in the theaters because the trailers and the
reviewers focused on the &quot;hi-jinx&quot; aspect-- clumsy, self-absorbed boys
running amuck while trying to satisfy their physical urges without regard to
any higher values such as love, relationship, appreciation of their fellow
human beings, etc. At the urging of my parents, however, I watched the DVD,
and was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie indeed had a heart. As
well as a bunch of crude, funny material-- solid comedy.<br /><br />Without revealing the outcomes of the &quot;plot&quot;-- let me just say that the
characters undergo a believable redemption and maturing that would be a high
point in any &quot;chick movie.&quot; I hesitate to give praise here at others'
expense, yet I think it is important to note the vivid contrast of this fine
and good hearted movie with another teen sex flick: &quot;10 Things I Hate About
You,&quot; which was released about the same time. &quot;10 Things...,&quot; as with so
many movies in this genre, was mean, low-spirited, and viciously hostile. It
was an insult to the audience, especially in its vulgar depiction of
adolescent boys as perverts and buffoons, and adolescent girls as greedy,
ego driven bitches. That's bad!  It perverted what is otherwise a normal
part of human life-- wholesome, randy good humor.<br /><br />&quot;American Pie&quot; has a good heart, and a good eye. See it and laugh, but don't
be surprised if you also get a tiny bit edified at the same time. Oh-- the
commentary track on the DVD is also great-- The director, the writer, I
think, and several of the actors all appear together with spirited good
humor and genuinely informative info-- that alone is worth the DVD
price!
