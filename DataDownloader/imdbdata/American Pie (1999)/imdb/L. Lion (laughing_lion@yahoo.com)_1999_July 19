1999_July 19 

It's been a long time since there was a teen sex comedy - most of the teen
movies coming out lately have been so cynical (Jawbreaker, 10 Thing I Hate
About You, She's All That) that you kind of forget the Porky's/Risky
Business genre exist.  If Risky Business is the high point of the genre and
Porky's the lowpoint, American Pie is much closer to RB.  The characters
are
dealt with in a fashion that isn't highbrow, the filmmakers continually
surprise you with how the situations evolve, especially regarding the Czech
exchange lovely, and there is nothing mean about it, although it depends
too
much on social embarrassment for its laughs.  Only one sincere gross-out
joke that just doesn't work and has been done before and recently,
regarding
a bodily fluid.  The high school characters feel real to a certain extent.
I wasn't charmed by it, but parts were charming.  If I were in high school
now I would have loved it.  B.
