Man you know one day i turn the TV on at night (i was really young, 12
i think) and there it was starting the &quot;American Pie&quot;. I don&#39;t really
understand it by the time, it was just a funny movie, when i see it
again by the age of 16, i knew that this movie was the funniest thing i
ever have seen. All the boys in the world have passed for this phase,
that&#39;s why this movie is so funny, is not something weird, it&#39;s just
natural, and the scenes are amazing unexpected but they are a
possibility. I laugh since the beginning till the end... Since that
time i saw this movie a lot of times and i still laugh of the jokes,
even more... The actors have a nice performance, especially Sean
William Scott in Stifler&#39;s role...that really brings a &quot;thing&quot; to this
movie that no other have...<br /><br />Tiago
