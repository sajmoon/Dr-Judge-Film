Sex by itself is not funny. Nor is anything else, for that matter. The
key to comedy is appropriately setting up and executing the jokes.
Fortunately, &#x22;American Pie&#x22; has all the requisite elements.<br /><br />Four best friends, Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas
Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have a problem: They are
seniors approaching graduation, and they still haven&#x27;t gotten laid.
Their egos are hurting, but when the biggest geek, Sherman (Chris Owen)
gets laid before they do, they decide enough is enough. The four make a
pact: each of them will have sex before the Senior Prom.<br /><br />The key to this kind of comedy is pushing boundaries. &#x22;How did they get
away with this?&#x22; will enter anyone&#x27;s mind at more than a few points in
the movie (the prudish MPAA notwithstanding). All the characters are
curious about sex, but they don&#x27;t know how to respond to it without
looking like geeks. This kind of awkwardness is good mining territory
for comedy, and the creators of &#x22;American Pie&#x22; exploit it for all it&#x27;s
worth. The result is a riotously funny comedy that will have even the
most tightly-wound doubled over in laughter for much of the time.<br /><br />But what really elevates &#x22;American Pie&#x22; from the usual raunchfests
(other than its funnier than most of what Hollywood shells out), is
that we actually begin to care about the characters in the film. None
of them are especially well-developed (this is an ensemble comedy), but
they are likable and more importantly, surprisingly real. We recognize
Jim&#x27;s infatuation with the Nadia, the sexpot foreign exchange student.
We understand how awkward Oz feels talking to a girl completely
different from him for the first time (Mena Suvari). We empathize with
both Kevin&#x27;s fears and uncertainties, and those of his girlfriend,
Vicky (Tara Reid). And strange as it may seem, we can see a bit of
ourselves in Finch&#x27;s refined taste.<br /><br />The acting is actually very good. Jason Biggs has the social
awkwardness down pat, and quite frankly, no one shows complete and
utter embarrassment like him. Thomas Ian Nicholas is good as Kevin,
although he is rather flat in his &#x22;big moment&#x22; speeches. That shouldn&#x27;t
be entirely faulted on him though, the dialogue in these scenes isn&#x27;t
especially well written. Chris Klein is rather flat as Oz, the jock.
He&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just that Oz could have used a little more energy.
Eddie Kaye Thomas is great as the tightly wound Finch.<br /><br />The girls are great too. Shannon Elizabeth is wonderful as the sexpot,
especially because she knows the effect she has on Jim. Tara Reid is
good as the girlfriend who wants everything to be perfect when she
loses her virginity. Mena Suvari is especially good as the mature
good-girl who, despite everything, falls for the jock. And Natasha
Lyonne is terrific as Jessica, the sexual know-it-all who is on hand to
give advice.<br /><br />There are three other actors that deserve mention. Eugene Levy is
hilarious as Jim&#x27;s Dad. The teenage years would be smooth sailing if
every teenage guy&#x27;s dad was Mr. Levenstein. When he finds out about his
son&#x27;s interest in sex, he&#x27;s not horrified, he presents him with porn!
Seann William Scott benefited most from his performance as the
obnoxious and egotistic Stifler, who&#x27;s so stupid that he doesn&#x27;t
realize that no one actually likes him. Jennifer Coolidge is hilarious
as Stifler&#x27;s Mom (more than that I will not say).<br /><br />If you want to really laugh (and laugh hard), &#x22;American Pie&#x22; is a great
way to go.
