  &quot;American Pie&quot; was a good way to confront important teenage issues.  Some
examples include sex, sex, and, uh, sex.  &quot;American Pie&quot; was a pretty funny
movie.  It was great to see history in the making.  I'm not saying that this
was a really important movie, but it put fuel on the ever-kindling fire of
dirty teenage flicks.  Without &quot;American Pie&quot; movies like &quot;Road Trip&quot; and
&quot;Scary Movie&quot; wouldn't even have been considered for production.  &quot;American
Pie&quot; didn't really pioneer dirty flicks, see the Farelly brothers for that,
it did though provide a precedent for the already mentioned
movies.<br /><br />  Although &quot;American Pie&quot; was somewhat meaningful for pubis movie goers, it
really was just an excuse for teens to see nudity.  Some teens aren't
blessed with Cinemax and Showtime, God bless those forsaken souls, and have
to appease their carnal requirements.  This film was just an excuse to
provide a little bit of water, in the ever dry throat of teenage lust.  Some
scenes and situations were less than raunchy though, and showed the
importance of relationship as more than just physical but it showed that
mutual likeness can be lovely.  Returning to the risque scene, some scenes
weren't appropriate for most young teens even, and kids these days here and
retell more dirty jokes than Rodney Dangerfield and Saturday Night Live
writers combined.  <br /><br />  So, if you're into raunchy teenage comedy, you'll like &quot;American Pie.&quot;  If
you're a young teenager who doesn't know what snowballing is (very obscure
term, see &quot;Clerks&quot;, great movie, to find out you fledgling dirty
terminologists) or if you're not sure what pea-braining is (I made that one
up), don't see it.  Wait till you see movies like &quot;Dumb &amp; Dumber&quot; or &quot;Fast
Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (Just kidding, don't see that one!), and then allow
yourself to relsih in the brilliance of vulgar teenage writers inspired by
Southern Comfort and Bong Residue.  If you're a parent screening the movie
for a sleepover or something like that, pretend that you never heard about
this film.                Choose Wisely and Enjoy!
