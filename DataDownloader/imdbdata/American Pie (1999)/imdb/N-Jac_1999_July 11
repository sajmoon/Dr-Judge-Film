1999_July 11 

This is a wait-for-the-rental kind of movie.  Definitely not worth my $7.
This movie is the result of what would happen if Larry Flynt took control
of
the 90210 plot lines. It was funny in a perverse sort of way -- I'm sure
my
14 year old brother loved it.  Most of the actors look like they're at
least
28 years old. Guys, don't take your girlfriends to this
movie.
