1999_July 23 

If I had to use one word to sum this whole movie up, I wouldn't be able to
do it. Words that come to mind are: hilarious, hysterical, raunchy, real
and
living. Since I'm still in highschool, most of this stuff is gonna make
sense to me sooner or later. If I live it or don't live it, it's still
funny
as hell in the movie.<br /><br />The actors were great.  After seeing Rookie of the Year's Thomas Ian
Nicholas all grown up, I would keep saying &quot;the rookie is finally gettin
some play!&quot; Well if you were there, it would be funnier to you. And if you
had the mind of my friends and I, you would understand. Enough with the
inside jokes, this movie is a classic. Whether you are in highschool now
or
graduated years ago, as long as you were at once a fun loving teen, I
GUARANTEE you will love, laugh and cry for this movie. Well not sad crying
but hysterical laughing crying. i'm out.
