2000_January 3 

Although this movie doesn't delve too deeply into anything meaningful, the
characters were likeable, the plot was entertaining, and I'm sure it will be
charmingly dated in a year or two. These are all the makings for a cult
film. And I mean that objectively, not as a complement or an
insult.<br /><br />The film follows high-school-aged boys through their rites of passage into
manhood: the quest to get some. The antics are relatively extreme and always
appropriate for the moment. I found myself saying &quot;Oh Jesus&quot; as much as
laughing, though. Look for the apple pie scene!<br /><br />I'm reminded of the 1987 film, The Allnighter, with yummy Susanna Hoffs and
Joan Cusack. I've caught The Allnighter late night on cable once or twice in
recent years, and I simultaneously find my eyes glued to the TV and my
deepest innermost self completely embarrassed for myself and for the cast. I
think that that's the ultimate fate of this movie.
