American Pie is what great teen films once were and what they are supposed
to be.  In a time when lame films like She's All That and Varsity Blues
are
making big bucks, American Pie actually comes through as an extremely
hilarious and very entertaining film.  Not only is the movie filled with
non-stop laughter, but the characters and the message they send are fully
realistic and plausible.  This, by far, is the funniest movie since
There's
Something About Mary.  Nudity and countless sex/masturbation jokes...what
else could you ask for in a movie.
