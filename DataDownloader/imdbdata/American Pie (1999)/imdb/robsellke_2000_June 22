&quot;American Pie&quot; is one of those movies that looks really crude and stupid in
the previews, but turns out to be sweet and actually good in reality.  There
is nudity and a lot of things that moral people would consider &quot;questionable
material&quot;, but that is also funny.  Despite a few ridiculous situations, the
movie is actually surprisingly in tune with high school kids and realistic. 
The plot is basically this, four high school senior boys make a pact
together to lose their virginity by Prom Night.  A lot of mix-ups happen, as
well as humiliations and popularity shifts among the other seniors.  One
thing that I don't really think is realistic, though, is the fact that the
students all remain more-or-less friendly and don't really go for each
other's throats all of the time, despite the fact that they have all been
terribly humiliated and embarrassed.  This leaves the film a little more
innocent, though, and doesn't really hurt it much.  So, in conclusion, this
movie was funny and pretty much realistic, with a few sip-ups.
