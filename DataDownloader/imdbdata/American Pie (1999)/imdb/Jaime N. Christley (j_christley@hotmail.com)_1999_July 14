1999_July 14 

The director and the writer, Paul Weitz and Adam Herz respectively, will
do
anything for a laugh -- that's good, as it turns out, because this movie
has
a great many laughs in it.  There's not much of that restricting,
suffocating &quot;logic&quot; stuff around, but &quot;American Pie&quot; is immensely
enjoyable.
I mean, almost none of the things that happen in this film would ever,
ever
come to pass in real life, but it doesn't matter.<br /><br />For starters, the characters aren't all one-dimensional.  Thankfully,
they're two-dimensional, so right away it has an edge on 60-70% of all the
movies ever made.<br /><br />Moreover, it's heart is in the right place.  Most high school movies these
days are all about cruelty and malice, especially towards (and among) the
women.  Not the case here.  This is the first conventional high school
movie
I've ever seen that made me smile so much (I say conventional because
&quot;Rushmore&quot; still trumps every one of them).<br /><br />Furthermore, it's very funny.  I wouldn't dare give away any of the really
great gags (we've all seen the trailer -- that's not the one I mean), but
I'll say this:  Weitz and Herz are extraordinarily skilled in audience
manipulation, which is to say that they know how and when to spring
unexpected surprises upon us.  They also know how to use foul language for
punch, rather than punctuation.<br /><br />The soundtrack is another positive.  It's all about joy and high energy --
even music from Third Eye Blind and Barenaked Ladies that suffers from
radio
overplay fits the mood appropriately.
