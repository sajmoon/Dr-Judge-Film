American pie on the outside seems like one of your coming of age movies,
but.... take another look.  If you don't want to be challenged in thinking
out plots or storylines, watch this.  Basically it's about a couple of high
school kids who want to &quot;get laid&quot; before the end of the prom.... (sound
familiar?)  Some good laughs along the way though.
