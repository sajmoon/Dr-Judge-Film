&quot;American Pie&quot; is one of the FUNNIEST movies in a very long time. I don't
think everyone will enjoy it, but if you need a few (make that a lot of)
good laughs, you will love this film. When I left everyone was talking
about
coming back for more. They were also reciting the more memorable lines in
the film. The cast did a great job as did the rest of the crew in
producing
a great piece of comedy that will attract many repeat viewers. One
suggestion for those who have yet to view it, go with a group of friends,
leave your mate at home!
