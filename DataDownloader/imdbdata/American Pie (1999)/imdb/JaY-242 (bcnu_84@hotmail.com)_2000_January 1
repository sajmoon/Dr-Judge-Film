American Pie is definitely a raunchy comedy. You realize this, five minutes
into the film. But also, I think anyone who sees it, realizes it is just a
movie, and it shouldn't be taken too seriously. During the summer, the
critics, as well as the press, thought this film was meant to expose
teenagers. Although this may be true, all teens who see this, know that is
is a comedy, most of the things that happen in the film, already happen in
high school today.
It's plot basically involves four high school boys, who make a pact to loose
their virginity before their high school prom, which is in about three
weeks.
Only one of the young boys has a girlfriend. From there, it gets even
funnier. The cast, which turned a lot of un-known's to stardom, was great.
Jason Biggs really has a lot of potential, few will forget his famous 'pie
scene,' nor will you forget Shannon Elizabeth's character, Nadia, after she
exposes herself on the Internet.
Watch this film with your friends, or a date, but definitely not with your
parents!
