I am a recent college grad and got to see this movie with a friend I hadn't
seen since we graduated high school together.  This movie really hit the
spot and gave us an opportunity to talk about our glory days in high
school.
Many seem to complain that sex is too often the topic, but unless you
don't
remeber because your too old or are ashamed, sex is a major issue to most
at
that age.  The only way I can see people not liking this movie is because
you did not share these experiences back in your day.  Finding your first
love, losing your virginity, and being in the tightest group of friends you
ever had and ever will have because you grew up with them for so long.  And
that &quot;next step&quot;.... it can prove to be the last time you have the
opportunity to have as much fun like the characters in this movie seemed to
have.  I can only imagine those who hate this movie being one of the band
dorks or the likes of the &quot;Shermanator&quot; and I feel sorry you missed out on
the experience and wild ride high school could have been.
