This film has got to be the biggest pile of rubbish I've ever
seen.<br /><br />The characters were unbelievable and totally unlikeable.  These were the
sort of people I would go out of my way to avoid.<br /><br />The &quot;gags&quot;, or rather the situations I had to imagine the writers thought
would be gags, were unfunny in the extreme.  They seemed to try to use
shock
tactics rather than genuine comedy.  Unfortunately, they managed to
neither
shock nor amuse me.<br /><br />In conclusion.  What a waste of time.
