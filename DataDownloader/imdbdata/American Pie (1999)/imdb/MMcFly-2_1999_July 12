1999_July 12 

I had a feeling that &quot;American Pie&quot; would be funny, but I did not expect
to
enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />Yes, this story about four high school seniors attempting to lose their
virginity is hilarious, crass, and raunchy, with jokes about flatulence,
self-love, and various bodily fluids, but still manages to have believable
characters and a smartly written script.<br /><br />The members of the ensemble cast all give fine performances, particularly
&quot;Election's&quot; Chris Klein as a jock who tries to find his sensitive side,
&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer's&quot; Alyson Hannigan as a talkative bando, and
&quot;SCTV&quot; veteran Eugene Levy as a father trying to teach his son the ways of
the birds and the bees.  The cast members are believable as high school
students, and even brought back some memories of my days in high
school.<br /><br />Be warned that this film has a high gross-out factor and uses little
restraint with sexual humor.  However, unlike last year's overrated
gross-out hit &quot;There's Something About Mary,&quot; the laughs are virtually
nonstop, and you do not see all of the funniest gags in the
trailer.<br /><br />The script is very clever, and actually is a tad sentimental amid all of
the
offensive goings-on.  The film is peppered with pop-culture references,
and
even pays homage to films like &quot;The Graduate&quot; and even &quot;WarGames.&quot;  The
film
even delivers a good message.  The four guys learn during their quest for
the dirty deed that having strong feelings for someone you truly care
about
is equally as gratifying.<br /><br />I really couldn't find anything wrong with this film.  I thoroughly
enjoyed
its nonstop humor, likeable characters and clever script.  Just keep in
mind
that this raunchy &quot;Pie&quot; is not for all tastes.
