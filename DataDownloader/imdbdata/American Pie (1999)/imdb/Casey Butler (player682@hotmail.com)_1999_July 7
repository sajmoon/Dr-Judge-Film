1999_July 7 

Well, I too saw the sneak preview of this delightful movie positioned
around
the quest of four high school seniors to get laid before graduation.  If
you
think the premise is vulgar, then you may not want to read on, b/c this
movie is not for you.  Not only does it put There's Something About Mary
to
shame with it's liberal use of bodily fluids, but it surpasses it through
its hilarious performances and unforgettable scenes.  To put this movie in
a
nutshell would be to label it a documentary about teenage sexual angst.
Needless to say, there are many things in this movie that resemble soft
porn, minus the cheesy music and bad acting.  The movie does do a very
good
job of displaying the different attitudes towards sex and quite possibly
(this may be a long shot) love through its use of great characterization.
Chris Klein, last seen in Election, brings another genuine performance to
the screen, along with Jason Biggs, who's new to me but obviously a pro
already, and Thomas Ian Nicholas, a wide-eyed poster boy for Clearasil.
But
the standout performance, although small, has got to be Alyson Hannigan as
a
naughty nerd who provides the movie with its most memorable
shock...believe
me, you'll know once you see it.  Yes, the toilet humor is abundant, but
the
script is equipped with nonstop laughs and clever interludes.  If you
enjoy
comedies and aren't embarrassed by the sight of naked women and
masturbation, then you have got to see this movie.
