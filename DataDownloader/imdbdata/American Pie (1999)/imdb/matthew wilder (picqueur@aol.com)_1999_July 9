1999_July 9 

Some wonk at Universal woke up one Monday last August, went to his desk,
picked up the phone and said, &quot;Gimme SOMETHING ABOUT MARY for
sixteen-year-olds&quot;--and now we have this wedge of comic raunch, a schizoid
vacillation between the WB-sweet and the Farrelly Brothers salty. It's a
very bad and quizzically likable movie--endearing mostly for its talented
cast, a group of game, fizzy youths you wish you were watching in
something
else. The movie lacks the guts of my favorite eighties horny-teen movie,
Boaz Davidson's coarse and then strangely lachrymose LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN
(1982), but even the cloying stuff feels heartfelt.  The best
performances:
Eddie Kaye Thomas as a pint-sized version of Aaron Eckhart in a Neil
LaBute
movie; Chris Klein, reprising his saintly jock from ELECTION; and Natasha
Lyonne, reprising her mouthy malcontent from SLUMS OF BEVERLY
HILLS.
