Most people think this movie is just another coming of age teen movie
with an abundance of toilet humor. While that is partially true, if
you&#39;re smart you can look deeper and realize that this movie is
actually pretty deep and clever social commentary. In the same way that
South Park uses crude humor to make fun of current events, this movie
makes fun of many current events. There are many examples of satire in
this movie and that is why its my favorite movie ever.<br /><br />Unfortunately this film is often misunderstood by un smart people and
that is sad. But don&#39;t be an idiot when you see this, because you
should see this movie its fantastic and funny, but analyze it and
realize that there is more to this movie than you realize at first.
