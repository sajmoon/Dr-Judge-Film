1999_July 14 

I saw South Park last week, so not much surprised me tonight when I saw
American Pie.  The masturbation jokes hit right on the mark.  We can all
relate to it.  There's really not much to say about the plot without
giving
away too many of the surprises, so I won't say much.  The biggest surprise
award goes to Alyson Hannigan, who accomplishes more than any other actor
with her limited screen time.  She does the same in Dead  Man on Campus.
As
far as nudity, there really is not that much, but for those of you who go
for that (and who am I to judge?) you probably won't be disappointed.  The
toilet humor midway through the film involving Finch is the only weak
point
in this fresh, funny, honest, smart, and often side-splitting motion
picture.  See it.
