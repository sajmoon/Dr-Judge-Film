2009_August 20 
It is one of the most beloved comedies of the last decade, seemingly
revered by all members of Generations X and Y; the first of a series
that supposedly includes no less than three inferior sequels; AND the
popularizer (if not the originator) of the term &#x22;MILF.&#x22; It also
jump-started the careers of actresses Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson
Hannigan, Tara Reid and Mena Suvari. So I thought it was high time that
this baby boomer finally caught up with 1999&#x27;s &#x22;American Pie,&#x22; and you
know what...this film really is some funny stuff, and had me--a hard
person to make laugh out loud--laughing out loud any number of times.
The film&#x27;s plot, about four soon-to-be-graduating high school guys
(Jim, Oz, Kevin and Finch) in pursuit of the Holy Grail (i.e., losing
their virginity by the night of the senior prom), may seem like a
familiar one, but it is fleshed out with likable and amusing characters
and benefits immensely by a brightly clever script. Among the funny
scenes are any that include Eugene Levy as Jim&#x27;s embarrassingly decent,
well-meaning father from hell (the scene with the dirty magazines is a
riot!); the plight of poor Finch in the ladies&#x27; rest room; the initial
making of the boys&#x27; pact; and, of course, any bit with &#x22;the
Shermanator,&#x22; the most hilarious would-be (nerd) Lothario until
&#x22;Superbad&#x22;&#x27;s McLovin&#x27; came down the pike eight years later. The film
has a raunchy exterior and a sweet soul, and ultimately gives its
audience the mixed message that sex is always better when it is
combined with true love. Especially if one really loves warm apple pie!
