On a scale of 0 to 100; I gave American Pie a score of
77.<br /><br />Before watching American Pie you must be warned: your sides will hurt from
laughing too much, and this laughter will come from mostly crude and rude
jokes that come with endlessly imaginative actions and fantastic
one-liners.
And after watching it you also must be warned: you will never, ever, ever
under any circumstances eat apple pie again, so make sure you have a slice
before you watch this laugh-a-minute teen comedy.<br /><br />At a high-school party, four friends Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian
Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) find that losing
their collective virginity isn't as easy as they had thought. But they
still
believe that they need to do so before college. To motivate themselves,
they
enter a pact to try to be the first to &quot;score.&quot; And of course, the senior
prom is their last best chance. As the fateful date draws near, the boys
wonder who among them will get lucky. More importantly, do they really want
to do it at all?<br /><br />To get the flaws over and done with; Natasha Lyonne is underused, and it is
a shame because she is by far the most interesting character in the movie,
she has some great quotable parts in the script (`It's not space shuttle
launch, it's sex'; `I like to keep my options open') and hopefully, in the
up-coming sequel, she'll get more time on-screen. There is also a largely
unfunny toilet &#145;gag' with the character of Finch, the scene totally steals
from Dumb &amp; Dumber, and crapping scenes have been done much funnier and
much
better. Okay, back to the good stuff, the cast is fantastic, Biggs is a
great find (unfortunately he kind of ruined his career with some dumb
comedies after he invested the part of Jim), Klein is sensitive and
believably hip, while the chick-a-dee's like Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and
ultimately Buffy's Alyson Hannigan, who manages to steal the entire film
with only one line. This is one blast of a fun movie, I can guarantee
you'll
be chuckling and smiling a long time after watching it.<br /><br />If not perfect, American Pie is easily the best teen sex comedy of 1999.
Highly recommended any time, any day.
