1999_July 11 

I was surprised.  I had seen the trailers, as did everyone, supposedly
giving away the movie's finer moments.  A few are in there, but there are
many more enjoyable ones.<br /><br />The plot is a little thin, I'll give it that.  (I like a little meat on my
plots ;)  Acting is sufficient, casting is about on-target, and the whole
thing is a little too long.<br /><br />But is it funny?  On the whole, yeah.  It's not sophisticated humor by
far,
and it's very much in-your-face, but a good number of the scenes had me
laughing out loud.  The biggest caveat is that I probably would have
enjoyed
it more if I was about 16 and still in high school.<br /><br />But male high school seniors as virgins?  Proof that this is fictional.
4.0/5.0 stars.
