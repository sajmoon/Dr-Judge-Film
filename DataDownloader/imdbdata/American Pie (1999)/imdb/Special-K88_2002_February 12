Wildly over-the-top, boldly honest, laugh-out loud funny teen comedy
centers around four hormone-driven high school guys who make a
desperate pact to lose their virginity by the night of their senior
prom. Their antics to win the bet soon get out of control as they all
must learn the hard way how to wine and dine their prospective female
companions. The film is sure to please because of its gross-out gags
which, while a bit extreme, are genuinely funny and convincing
portrayals of teenage sexuality. The comedy cleverly avoids turning
mean-spirited despite the sometimes raunchy subject matter, and there
are plenty of likable, memorable characters and situations. An ideal,
good-natured teen comedy. ***
