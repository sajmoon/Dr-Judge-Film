&quot;American Pie&quot; could have been a lot of things it could have been a mean
spirited comedy or a pointless gross-out picture but it is neither. It
manages to be funny with out being insulting. I didn't want to see this
movie when it came out but now I am glad I did. For anybody who likes comedy
this film is a must. Also, Mena Suvari is a babe!!
