American Pie was the FIRST teenage/high school flick I saw in my life where
watching it actually made me feel old.  I was 23 pushing 24 when I saw AP
in
theaters in '99.  Before that I could still watch teen flicks and even high
school flicks, even though I was no longer a teen and no longer(thank God)
in high school.  No problem whatsoever.  But I guess in '99 I realized it
had been 6 years since I was in high school, and these goofy teen flicks
got
repetive and boring to me.  The teens in the theater were laughing their
heads off, probably thinking that AP was brand new and original, when in
reality it is old, old, old, tired and cliche.<br /><br />I saw AP with two friends, one guy was exactly my age and I looked at him
and knew he hated AP for the same reasons I did.  My other friend was still
20 at the time, and he was laughing his head off.  Poor guy, I guess he can
be forgiven, when you are 20 a lot of people still think of themselves as
&quot;teens&quot; and can still watch movies like this.  I know I could,.....until
23.
Millions of REAL teens in 1999(unlike my friend who was 20) will cherish
&quot;American Pie&quot; as &quot;their film&quot; a hallmark of their growing years and
something that made them &quot;come of age&quot;.  I guess I had &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;
and even &quot;Clueless&quot;.  But AP will always be remembered by me....it was a
coming of age piece for me.  It was the first teen flick I watched where I
just sat and stared at the screen trying to remind myself to laugh and stop
feeling so old watching this.  Since AP, I realized I could NEVER watch a
teen flick again without feeling like an old geezer.  Trust me, you think
it
won't happen to you....wait till you turn 23, or even 22.<br /><br />
