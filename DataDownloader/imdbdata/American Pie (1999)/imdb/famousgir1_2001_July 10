American Pie is an hilariously original fun comedy about sex-craze teens.
The film definitely has it's moments and the whole cast are great
especially: Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, Natasha Lyonne, Seann William Scott
and Mena Suvari. I'm really glad that they are all coming for the sequel
which I can't wait to see and who knows their may even be a third
installment of American Pie. I give the film a 10/10
