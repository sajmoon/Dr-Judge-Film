1999_July 12 

I have read the other reviews left by other users and professional
critics.
Most agree that this movie is funny however some disapprove of this movie
because its vulgarity and because of its targeted audience.  I believe
that
this movie is pretty vulgar but not to the point that it becomes
non-tasteful and obscene.  As far as the targeted audience of teenagers, I
believe that this movie is suitable for any teenager 15 and older. The
truth
is teenagers today are pretty vulgar and so most teens can relate to many
of
the situation in this movie (at least most guys can).  The issues dealt
with
in this movie have been discussed and acted out among teens for the
longest.<br /><br />If you're against this movie because it's vulgar you need a reality check!
If you have teens, then listen to their telephone calls, snoop though
their
stuff, check their computer, and I bet you will be shocked!<br /><br />The fact is that this movie just reflects teens today and what teens are
doing today are the same things teens have done in the past!  The only
difference is today is a little more high tech!   Besides, if you take
away
the vulgarity then alls you have left is a boring movie that promotes
&quot;good
values&quot;,  (a movie that no one would watch).  With the vulgarity you have
a
funny, believable, movie that promotes &quot;good values&quot;.
