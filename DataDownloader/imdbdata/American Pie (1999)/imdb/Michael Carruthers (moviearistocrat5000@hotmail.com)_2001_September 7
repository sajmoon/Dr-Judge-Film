AMERICAN PIE (1999)
Rating: 8/10<br /><br />I like this film a lot and I don't care who knows it. It is funny, romantic,
dramatic, truthful, funny and did I mention it's really, really funny.
However, I was disappointed by the Un-rated version. It didn't have much
changed from the old movie, maybe a little bit more explicit, but please!
They could've at least made it sound as good as the cover promised. Don't
worry too much though, it improves on the first movie's sexual details, and
you'll still find the film as enjoyable and as rewatchable. Now, back to the
film. The star-studded cast all do fantastically, bringing their characters'
sexually desperate, teen angst feelings blazingly alive. Most are newcomers
who have had small roles &#150; Tara Reid in Urban Legend or Chris Owen in
October Sky &#150; but they are all promising roles as good as this one in the
near future. The script is repeatedly clever with its hilarity and although
drink will be coming out your nose, for the most light-hearted people, tears
may be coming out of your eyes. All in all, this is a &#150; I'll repeat it again
just so you understand fully &#150; REALLY funny film that won't appeal to
everyone, but for all viewers who are looking for some raunchy fun, don't
miss American Pie! It is well worth the time and money.<br /><br />
