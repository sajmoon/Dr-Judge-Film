2001_June 17 

This is a disgusting movie. I was horrified by it when I saw it. I was
more
frighten than amused by the jokes and gags. It is quite evident that this
was made for the young generation as they are the only ones who find this
funny. I am 18, and is both disgusted and horrified by this. If this is
what
will sell, I wish to have no part with both my generation and Hollywood.
There is not one amusing scene in this garbage. I have a better time
watching grass grow then sitting though this. At least the grass has
enough
decency not to be gross when growing. To sum this all up, this is modern
day
rubbish that attracts to the simple and closed-mined.
