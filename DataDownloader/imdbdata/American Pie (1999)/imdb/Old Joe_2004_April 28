While this movie might be a very funny look at the very taboo subject of
sex, I feel it is the right time for me to give my opinion on what was a
very popular teenage film. This film had a cast that was extremely funny
and
a story that should and does appeal to many teenagers. However I am going
to
also throw some ideas to young people, that think sex is just a game or
something which has to be dared, pressured or made a pact on in a group to
do, to thus gain the greatest human conquests, of getting 'laid', (a term
I
totally disagree with).<br /><br />In this coming-of-age comedy, a group of friends at the end of their
senior
year make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. In their
outrageous
attempts to fulfil this mission, they come to some surprising, hilarious
and
often touching realisations about themselves, their friendships, their
notions of love, romance and their relations with the opposite sex. As the
fateful date draws near, the boys wonder who among them will get lucky.
More
importantly, do they really want to do it at all?<br /><br />This story was very funny the first time I watched it, in a packed cinema.
Yet as I have gotten a little older, my feelings on the movie and what it
is
about have changed quite substantially. Having the four main characters
try
to find glory with a girl has been done so many times, but then again I
can
see this film had some sort of originality to it. I did like the direction
this film took, under the guidance of the Weitz brothers.<br /><br />The cast this film had, while rather unknown in talent, was extremely
good.
I enjoyed the role that Jason Biggs took on especially. To think that his
character Jim was bagged for almost everything he did, it was even more
courageous to act it. I remember in an interview, he said he had no
problems
doing the 'pie scene'. I am not sure I would have been so calm about it.
Jason has gone on to do movies such as the disappointing Loser and a film
called 'Boys and Girls'. The other obvious favourite in this film would
have
to be the gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth. She was very good as exchange
student
Nadia. The scenes she has with Jim are priceless, but alas of course he
'blows' the chance with her.<br /><br />Other members in the cast include the innocent Heather (Mena Suvari). She
was a different member of the movie's group who stood out a little bit,
and
made the right decisions for herself. The better role the Mena has done
would have to be in American Beauty, where she was a lot more liberated in
what she did and said. Finch was played Eddie Kaye Thomas, and I can
relate
to the way his character is treated in American Pie. He is the supposed
'brains' of the group, yet outside of the classroom he was made a complete
idiot of.<br /><br />The other standout role in this film (if you it can have such a thing?)
would have to be that of Stifler (Sean William Scott). He was the bragger
of
the film, saying he can score with any girl he likes, which in reality is
probably true. Why I don't know? Sean has also appeared in other films
such
as the crazy 'Dude where's my car', which I did not like, 'Road Trip' and
in
the tense thriller 'Final destination'.<br /><br />Yet we have other roles such as Vicki (Tara Reid) and her onscreen
boyfriend
Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols). While Jessica (Natasha Lynne), the flute
toting
Michelle (Allison Hannigan) and Oz (Chris Klein), round out a pretty good
cast. Yet the one person who was a little older in this movie, but still
very good, was Jim's Dad (the hilarious Eugene Levy). He was so funny,
that
he could almost be my favourite of the whole film, with his adlibs just
great.<br /><br />Yet this film makes a great mockery of something is meant to be so
special.
If people around the world try to lose their virginity, because others
around them have, then I am afraid to say that sex has lost all it
sacredness and value. Yet also think about what the consequences are of a
sexual relationship. The AIDs virus is a deadly part of our society now,
as
are other STDs. Then what about unwanted pregnancies? They are common
occurrence these days, which is a real problem. I am not so sure that this
film worries about issues such as these, instead trading them in for a
good
laugh instead. Can people see where I am coming from?<br /><br />This film also reminded me a lot of films such as the totally funny
'Mischief', starring the gorgeous Kelly Preston. I remember reading that
this film was based a little bit on Mischief. It also felt a bit like
'Fast
times at Ridgemont high' and the brilliant 'Breakfast Club'. In that way I
say that American Pie was good, yet it also had originality that it could
only have.<br /><br />I have heard many people who loved this film, especially young immature
teenage boys (who else but the silly looking boys hey?). Yet I met one
girl
who said that after one hour of viewing this movie she told me that she
had
to leave the cinema. I am not surprised by this reaction. As a Christian,
I
feel that sex is a gift that was given to us by God. Yet the general
public
abuses something so special by making it a very selfish act. We are not
making love any longer, but sleeping around to get better names for
ourselves. If people can not see that American pie does this to a very big
extent, then our younger generation are more na&iuml;ve than I
thought!<br /><br />CMRS gives 'American Pie': 4 (Very Good Film)
