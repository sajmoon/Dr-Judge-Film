2001_April 22 

A film that followed on from &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; in a return to
the gross-out comedies of the early 1980's.<br /><br />This film totally disregards it's female characters, and has no plot
whatsoever. It's just a compilation of situation gags, some better than
others. Designed to titillate and amuse 14 year old boys. I prefer my comedy
more intelligent.
