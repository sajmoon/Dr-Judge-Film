American Pie was undoubtedly a huge success financially. It gave hope to the
struggling teen comedy genre and for the past two years we've had to endure
rip-offs even worse than this.  The movie feels as fake and tasteless as a
Mcdonald's pie, with almost no genuine comedic moments. Worst yet, near the
end we get a moment where our hero, Jim says he's sick of talking about sex
and isn't so excited to have it anymore, while the supporting characters nod
their heads in agreement. The moral about taking time to have sex is
particularly pretentious in a movie like this, and is even more undermined
by the fact that they all have sex in the last 15 minutes.  Jason Biggs, as
we have seen recent films can barely carry a film without humping a pie, and
his career is already burning out.  Unfortunately, American Pie 2 will be
released this week, which is sure to make a lot of money. American Pie not
only stands as a vastly overrated movie, but one of the worst to ever
inspire a sequel.
