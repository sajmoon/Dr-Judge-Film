1999_July 7 

The funniest movie I've ever seen!  The entire audience at my theater's
sneak preview was roaring.  this is for very mature teenagers and adults
only.  Some of the one-liners were the best written ever for a movie.
Very
quick witted &amp;  well written.  My only complaint is that the ending wasn't
as
good as the body of the movie.  It semed to fizzle.
