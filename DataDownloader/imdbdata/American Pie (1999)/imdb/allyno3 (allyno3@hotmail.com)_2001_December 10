I remember going to see this twice at the cinema.  It was the first day it
came out.  I found &quot;American Pie&quot; a genuinely amusing comedy, although it
may have been the crudest comedy I had seen at the cinema at that time, but,
unlike Me, Myself &amp; Irene, this only poked fun at things which you thought
wasn't funny but you yourself had to go through, while other, so-called
comedies (such as the above) just shock for the sake of it.<br /><br /> Really, it is very lightweight, and possibly not as shocking or hilarious
as many made out, but as a sex education, you won't get many better films,
or come to think of it, a film as funny as it.<br /><br />
