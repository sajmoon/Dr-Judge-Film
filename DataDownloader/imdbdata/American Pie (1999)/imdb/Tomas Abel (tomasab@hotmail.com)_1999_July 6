1999_July 6 

If you hear people telling you not to see this movie, just turn them off,
walk away, don't listen. Some are going to say - &quot;...the jokes are just
tired...&quot;, &quot;...too many sex and masturbation jokes...&quot;, and one of my
favorites &quot;...it just isn't deep enough; has no message...&quot;. For crying
out
loud, tell them to that people do have sex and they do masturbate. So why
not put it on the big screen? Tell them that no matter how hard they will
try to make sex and masturbation go away they will never succeed because
they both are a natural part of a human life cycle. Sex, nudity and jokes
sell - that's what American Pie counts on and it is right.<br /><br />The cast of virtually unknown actors gives a great performance and for
those
who only go to see a movie for &quot;positive messages conveyed to the world&quot;
the
film does even have one - at the end the characters realize that life is
not
just about sex. Some of them even fall in love with their movie partners
(only to be separated later when they go to college, but that's a
different
story).
So, please all you people who have no clue why you go see a comedy, get
one
or don't go. You have your right to have an opinion, but you're not
necessarily right (at least in this instance). American Pie (and most
other
movies) is not meant to convey positive messages to the youth, scold
people
for having sex, nor encourage them to have sex. Am. Pie doesn't glorify
sex,
nudity, or alcohol, it simply points out the obvious - they are all there,
right here, in our very lives. It's a comedy that is close not just to
teenagers but to adults as well, because so many of both groups can
relate... All the &quot;message seekers&quot; should try to see this movie with open
eyes and stop being so &quot;goody-too-shoes&quot;. For them, there's something
about
high school that they dislike and I am not going to elaborate here on what
that is...
Great Comedy...
