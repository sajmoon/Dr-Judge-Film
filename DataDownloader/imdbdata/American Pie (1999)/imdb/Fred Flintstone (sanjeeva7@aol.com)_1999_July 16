1999_July 16 

This movie brings back memories to 80's classic movies.  For instance
compare Fast Times at Ridgemont high when Judd Nelson  fantasizes on the
toilet vs. Jason Biggs and his tube sock.  Or how about Belushi and his
speech in Animal House (was it over when the German's bombed Pearl
Harbor...) vs. Thomas Ian Nicholas' let's get laid before prom pact.  You
know when you are in the 90's when there is a scene in the movie
broadcasted
over the Internet with a webcam.
