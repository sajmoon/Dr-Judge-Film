This film made me laugh in places, but not all through it, I 
agree with another reviewer this is an overrated film. The
characters no one cares about, and are poorly acted. The film
makers tried to make this a coming of age story, which they
should not have done, they should have kept it as a teen sex
comedy. In the end this movie is an &quot;Animal House&quot; wannabe
