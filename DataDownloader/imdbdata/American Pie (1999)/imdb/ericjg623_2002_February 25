2002_February 25 

This is the first DVD I have rented where I simply reached a point where I
refused to watch any more. It was about 25 minutes into the movie, where the
father of one of the boys walks into his bedroom with a bag full of porno
mags and start explaining their, uh, &quot;use&quot; to his teenage son. I mean, talk
about a cringe moment! I have already endured the &quot;accidental drinking of
the beer with the used condom in it&quot; scene followed by the barfing over the
girl scene, but I have hit my limit. This movie is going back into its case
and back to the video store with the rest unwatched. <br /><br />I mean, it's not like I'm some kind of prude when it comes to my viewing
habits. I loved &quot;Married ... With Children&quot; and most of Kevin Smith's films,
but this falls into the category of being crude and disgusting without being
creative or funny. <br /><br />2/10
