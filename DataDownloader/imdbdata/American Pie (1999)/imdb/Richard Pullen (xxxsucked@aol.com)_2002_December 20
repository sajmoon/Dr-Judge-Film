American Pie is a funny film, the fact is that most people that see it some
how try associate themselves to the character with cries
of...<br /><br />&quot;That is so me!&quot;<br /><br />Half the time its not, but that doesnt matter!<br /><br />Jason Biggs is good as Jim, the shy kid on his mission to &quot;do&quot; Nadia (Molly
Shannon). Sean William Scott is the other notible performance as
Stifler.<br /><br />The others however are wooden too much of the time!
