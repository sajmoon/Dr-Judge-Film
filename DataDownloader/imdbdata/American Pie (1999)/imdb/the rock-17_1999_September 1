1999_September 1 

Warning: This Review Contains Plot Material<br /><br />I really liked this movie a lot.  A lot of the scenes were great (including
the now infamous Jason Biggs and the Pie scene), and the acting was
hilarious and excellent.<br /><br />I thought the two strongest characters who really made this movie extremely
entertaining were Eugene Levy and Alyson Hannigan, and I don't think many
people disagree with me there.  Eugene Levy, playing Jason Biggs' father,
was just downright hilarious as usual.  Seeing someone like Eugene giving a
sex-ed role like he did was just so funny.  Like when he saw the condoms in
his sons room, or the opening scene (I still laugh thinking about this) when
he walks in on his son....I just can't get enough of how funny Eugene Levy
was in that movie.<br /><br />The same goes true for Alyson Hannigan.  Seeing her play the &quot;geek&quot; (no
offense) on TV's Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, a show that I love, and then
seeing her change of character in this movie is hilarious.  At first, you
see her pretty much resembling her dorky character in Buffy, but then she
suddenly changes, and she becomes a totally different person.  It has to be
one of the funniest things I have seen on the silver screen in a long
time.<br /><br />I really liked this movie, and I recommend it for anyone who wants to be
purely entertained, because this is what American Pie does, and in a very
big way.  Go see this movie soon.  My grade: A-
