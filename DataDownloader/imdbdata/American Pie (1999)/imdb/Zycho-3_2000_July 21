I loved American Pie! Unlike any other teen flicks, it mixes sexual crude
dialogue with lovely and touching romance. There are absolutely no faults
at
all, the cast was perfectly chosen and made me fall in love with half the
gals in there, while the production and screenplay were done very well.<br /><br />American Pie is a cool, hip, funny, sexy, cute and amusing comedy that
will
make you laugh your head off, and see how much better teenybopper flicks
can
be. I highly recommend you see it if you want to laugh your head
off!<br /><br />Rating: 10
