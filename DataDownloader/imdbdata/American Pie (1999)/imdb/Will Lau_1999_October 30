I loved this movie! This movie is what dreams are made of. Amazingly funny.
I thought the comedy genre was dead but this jump starts it back to life.
Its like There's something about Mary only 10 times funnier. Very clever
plot line tells the tale of a group of typical north American teenagers who
just want to loose their virginities. Is that really too much to ask? The
entire movie was funny from start to finish. The acting was outstanding.
Plus its got that girl that plays Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV
show. She's so cute! Quite possible the funniest movie ever made in the
history of man.
