I think you really have to be a teen to truly enjoy this movie.  I am 17,
and I thought it was terrific.  It had a brilliant cast even a good lesson
in the end.  I don't think adults really understand this type of humor.
They find it shocking.  I didn't really find it all that shocking.  I
recommend that all teens see this because it's a great movie.  Great
movies
don't necessarily have to be real smart ones, because sometimes the stupid
things are what makes a movie great.
