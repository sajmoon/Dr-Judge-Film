1999_August 15 

This is not some silly fantasy about getting some; this is the real deal.
An
accurate portrayal of all that late pubescent angst which generally
culminates in a less than satisfactory experience. Consequently, this film
culminates in a thoroughly satisfactory movie going experience. It is a
remarkably masterful work by a talented group of people.
The script was honest, natural, and very funny. I would not be at all
surprised if Adam Herz' writing is nominated for an academy award. 1000
years from now, when an inquisitive anthropologist wants to know what it
was
like to be seventeen in the late 1900s this could be part of the
definitive
reference trilogy along with &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; and &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont
High&quot;.
Well done! Let's see some more!
