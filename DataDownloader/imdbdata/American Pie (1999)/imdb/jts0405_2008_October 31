The first American Pie really set the ground work for the others to
follow. Although there are too many to count now and a million
different Stiflers you still think back to the first pie movie. It
really lead the plot through the sequels and spin-offs. If I ever catch
this one on TV I will turn to it right away because it is truly a great
teenage sex comedy. The two sequels to follow were not as great as this
because it is the piece of pie that sliced it open for the others to
follow through. I enjoyed this movie a lot and recommend seeing this
before any of the other knock offs or sequels. Jason Biggs really pulls
through as the nerdy high school guy that is just trying to get a
little action. So if you haven&#39;t already seen this then see it sometime
soon.
