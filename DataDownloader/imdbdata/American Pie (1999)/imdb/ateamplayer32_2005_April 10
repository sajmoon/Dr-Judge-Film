American Pie is one of the many great films of the 90's. It goes into
the minds of high school teens and shows whats really goes on. With its
awkward funny moments and lovable characters this is a must see. You
can relate all the characters to you and your buddies back in High
School. Although it has a very loose plot it makes up for it with its
hilarious scenes of what guys think sex should be and how much they
want it. I kept wanting more and it kept delivering more great humor.
It also includes a good romance scene or two. I recommend this for
anyone who likes their humor with some nudity and perverted actions. On
the other hand it has some cheezy jokes and some bad displays of
acting. Its almost hard to notice the mistakes in this film because you
are trying to maintain control of yourself as your cracking up. Jason
Biggs delivers a great performance as Jim Levetstein, the nervous guy
who isn't so lucky with girls. I could relate to so many of the
characters on so many levels, and i think you will too. 3 stars
