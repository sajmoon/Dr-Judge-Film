1999_July 10 

I can't believe he porked a pie!  I saw this with my girl, who despises
the
recent proliferation of teeny-bopper films as much as I, and we had a
ball.
Though we both were nursing terrible hangovers, we laughed ourselves to
tears throughout the film.  I can't remember laughing so much at a movie
while sober, and I don't think I've ever seen her laugh so hard outside of
a
pool hall.  Though the film took the discovery and yearning for
fornication
to absurdity, it's best not to search for any profundity here.  This is a
fun film, so sit back and enjoy it.  And don't worry when the film begins
to
recede into kitsch morality and sensitivity, for you are saved at the
moment
of finally dismissing the movie by the band-camp girl.  This is an
audience
participation film, though, so watch it with a good one.
