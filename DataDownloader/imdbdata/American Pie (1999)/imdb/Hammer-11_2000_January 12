I rented this movie because everyone was talking about how funny it was. I
was very disappointed. The movie is full of shocking toilet humor and it
has
nothing in it for anyone over the age of 13. Unfortunately, you wouldn't
want anyone that age to watch this kind of filth. I don't mind this kind of
teenage sex comedy done well, but this movie is just dumb. It's basically a
'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' effort ruined by a South Park mentality.
Shame on us for encouraging this as filmmaking.
