1999_July 12 

Most comments I have read about this film point out only the &quot;gross-out&quot;
elements.  What people seem to be missing is this is one of the most
realistic films dealing with the subject of teenage sexuality.  Yes, some
scenes are juvenile.  However, the film also portrays safe sex and
realistic
sex--not the usual &quot;acceptable&quot; Hollywood sex (Jack and Rose have sex
after
knowing each other for only two days in Titanic, where were the Puritan
critics then?).  It seems sex is only OK in films if it is glamorous and
has
no mention of condoms.  As a 23 year old female, I appreciated the
realistic
portrayal of high school boys as I remember--horny and clueless.  However,
these boys do learn some respect for women, at least more than they had at
the beginning of the film; and, the girls do not allow them to get away
with
their disrespect and juvenile actions.  I think this is not a bad film for
high schoolers, as it contains no violence and is actually quite
entertaining.
