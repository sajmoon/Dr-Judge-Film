&quot;Porky's&quot; or &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High,&quot;  are two
of the greatest movies of this caliber.  American Pie, which does a great
job in following suit, is one of the most refreshingly entertaining movies
I've seen in the last several years.  It contains many pranks as well as
many schemes that backfire, and plenty of humor to get the politicians in
an
uproar.   But I was very surprised at the fact that the movie carried many
redeeming messages with it.  IE, sex, although enjoyable and sometimes
being
the only goal of horny youngans, is not the most important thing in life,
they only think it is. I know I'm not alone in my theory.  Many of us were
once horny teens who at the very least, THOUGHT about doing unspeakable
things to simulate the act of sex.  And if you laugh while watching this
movie's depiction of this very point, put yourself into that
category.<br /><br />Movies about high school have been on the lame side for the last 5 or 6
years.  American Pie will hopefully start a rebellion against the &quot;She's
All
Thats&quot; of the world.  I say this because I get offended when directors
portray high school as this adult world where everyone knows the score and
seems to be so organized and on top of things (ie Dawson's Creek, Beverly
Hills 90210).  Myself, along with most of the other 440 people in my
graduating class (as well as the rest of the country's high shcool
population) didn't know anything, now looking back on it.<br /><br />American Pie is a movie for anyone who was once a confused and curious
teenager in high school, guys and girls alike. The bluntness of the humor
may suggest it's only for men.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.  Under all the
bits
and pranks, you will find an actual movie with loads of charm that is well
worth your time.
