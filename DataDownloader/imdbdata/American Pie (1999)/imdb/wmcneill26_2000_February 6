American Pie is closer to the truth than most people want to admit. Anyone
who pans this movie is probably doing so because they either forgot what it
was like to be a teenager or grew up in a convent.<br /><br />Of course certain scenes are exaggerated, but that is what movie making is
all about. Real-life events are stretched out to the extremes of
believability.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I've made similar pacts with friends, spied on
good looking women, and still turned out fine. Loosen up people, this is a
very funny movie.
