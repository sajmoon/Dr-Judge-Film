When American Pie was in the theaters a couple years ago it was then the
king of shock movies.  They took the overdone sophomoric teenage sex
obsession and made it fresh and funny.    This film is like a sexual
Jackass.  American Pie is still relatively funny, but it needs its shock
value which will be lost as time drags on.  Its still a hoot.  Quite a hoot.
