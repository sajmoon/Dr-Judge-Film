If this movie really reflects the american reality, then I feel very sorry
for american youth.<br /><br />Can't say much about the film itself - it's somewhat funny at times, but
overall is vulgar and obnoxious. The plot is far-fetched (at least from my
perspective) and acting is mediocre. I gave it a generous
3/10.
