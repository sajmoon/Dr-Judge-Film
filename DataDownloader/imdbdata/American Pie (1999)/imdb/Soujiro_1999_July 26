1999_July 26 

I really remember very little of this movie.  Not because I wasn't paying
attention, but rather because the writing was so light and fluffy, I never
really got a feel for  who the main characters were.  This is a movie about
events and actions rather than emotion or even thought. <br /><br />There are definitely some funny moments in the film, but I never really
laughed out loud.  I think that perhaps if I were a junior high student, I
might enjoy the jokes a bit more.  The film feels like an 80's teen comedy
with a few sexual jokes thrown in.  I liked the character of Stifler, the
profanity spouting cretin that all of us have to deal with at least once in
our lives.  Eddie Kaye Thomas reminds me of a young Nicholas Cage in his
role as Finch with a kind of lazy charm.  The music is fairly standard for
this type of film.<br /><br />I try not to go into a movie with any expectations, but this movie was
really disappointingly average, sickeningly sweet, and unrealistic.  The
main characters in The Wood, a movie with a similar premise, are much more
interesting, believable, and intelligent.  Frankly, even the characters in
Tarzan have more depth and personality.  I only recommend this movie to
those who enjoy shutting off their brains for a couple hours (not always a
bad thing to do).
