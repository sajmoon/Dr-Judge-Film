This is, undoubtedly, one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while,
(barring 'American Pie 2' and 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'), though, if
I may suggest, if you're going to buy it, you MUST ABSOLUTELY get the
unrated version of this and its sequel, because in lowering it to R rating,
they take out some of the greatest scenes and jokes in the movies. Just my
humble opinion.
