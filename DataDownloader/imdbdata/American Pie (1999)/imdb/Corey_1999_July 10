1999_July 10 

First and foremost, this movie will send you into fits of laughter, but
there is an undertone which suggests something deeper.  I would be a liar
if
I said this was not a comedy of heroic proportions, and I would also be
dishonest in saying that it did not disgust me.  But hey, it's the closest
thing to high school I've seen since Fast Times At Ridgemont High.<br /><br />Jason Briggs delivers an astounding performance as the &quot;awkward guy&quot;, and
the other members of the cast are talented as well.  There are a lot of
unseen messages in this film, but the one that shines in the end is:  It's
not all about sex.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this film for kids, and it isn't a family-oriented
experience, but I would suggest it for struggling teens in that stage
where
&quot;virginity is EVERYTHING&quot;.
