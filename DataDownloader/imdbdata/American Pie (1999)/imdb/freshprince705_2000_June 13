When I first saw this movie in theaters, I thought it was the greatest movie
ever made. As some of you can tell by this, I am a teenager. I watched it a
few times when it came out on video, and for the most part, it was equally
as good. A lot of older people might not like this movie, but it is an
excellent portrayal of high school students today and a laugh-a-second
movie. Jason Biggs is great as Jim, but Eugene Levy and Seann William Scott
have to be the funniest characters as Jim's father and Stiffler
respectively. Nadia and Vicky are hot, and it's hard to believe that Thomas
Ian Nicholas could go from pitching for the Cubs as Henry Rowengardener in
'Rookie of the Year' to orchestrating Sex Bible secrets as Kevin in
'American Pie' in what seemed like such a short time. If you liked 'Can't
Hardly Wait', 'She's All That', or 'Porky's', you will like this ten times
better. Probably my favorite movie; 9.5/10.<br /><br />
