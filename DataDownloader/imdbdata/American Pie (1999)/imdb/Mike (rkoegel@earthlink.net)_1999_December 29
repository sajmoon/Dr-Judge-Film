1999_December 29 

I heard this movie was really great, so I saw it and was glad I did.  It's
not as &quot;shocking&quot; nor as &quot;repulsive&quot; as I heard from many.  I think this
movie accurately portrays a teenager's struggling life and the situations
that occur.  All of the characters in this movie are funny, and likeable. 
The pie scene wasn't too explicit, but the implications were there.  The DVD
contains tons of extra so if you like this movie I'd highly recommend it. 
However, subject matter in this movie isn't exceptable for young kids, but I
think 14 and 15 year olds can handle it.
