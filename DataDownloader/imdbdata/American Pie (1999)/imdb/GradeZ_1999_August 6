There&#39;s really nothing spectacular about American Pie other than the
fact that it really is funny as hell. I found myself in a state of
general disbelief in several parts of the film (namely the opening
scene and the now infamous pie scene which both featured humor at Jason
Biggs&#39; expense). Yeah, this movie is Porky&#39;s with better writing and
more heart - but hey, so what? Who didn&#39;t love the Teenage Sex Comedy
genre when it was on top years ago? Alright, movies like Meatballs
Three sunk that ship (and rightfully so) but now the genre (as they all
seem to do) has returned with a bang.<br /><br />Looking back on those movies from the eighties, the realization occurs
that they just weren&#39;t all that funny. American Pie is very funny.
There were points while watching Pie when I couldn&#39;t hear most of the
follow up jokes to the big gags because the audience was laughing so
loud. The characters (both male and female) are certainly likable
enough even though it&#39;s not clear whether there is a future star
amongst the young actors (though Biggs deserves something for his
self-deprecation). However, proper accolades must go to veteran comedic
actor Eugene Levy who is simply brilliant as Jim&#39;s straight-laced dad.
It is their hilarious and at times very touching relationship that
really shone through for me. Call me crazy but if there is any justice
at the Oscars this year Levy will get a supporting actor nomination.
But, alas, we all know that comic actors seldom get the nods they
deserve from the academy (Murray got wrongfully slighted for Rushmore
last year in my opinion).<br /><br />Overall, American Pie is perhaps the best Teenage Sex Comedy of all
time. So, if you&#39;re starved for a delightful romp or if you&#39;ve ever
been to band camp&#133;
