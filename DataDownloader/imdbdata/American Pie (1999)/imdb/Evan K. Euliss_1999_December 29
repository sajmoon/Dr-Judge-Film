1999_December 29 

Time and time again movies come to video claiming to be the unrated, uncut
version.  The same true for the latest release of American Pie.  I love this
movie, but when I saw it on tape claiming to be &quot;The version you couldn't
see in theaters&quot;.  I was greatly disappointed.  For of what I could tell
only one 3 second clip was different even though the back of the box claimed
more of Nadia, more Pie, and so on.  I am just tired of being duped into
believing that there is new stuff on these movies.
