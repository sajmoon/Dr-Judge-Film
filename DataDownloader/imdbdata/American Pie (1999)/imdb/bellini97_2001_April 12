After hearing a bunch of good stuff about this film and then finally
seeing
it, I was disappointed by it.  The characters are pretty likable,
depictions
of high school seem pretty down-to-earth, and Jason Bigg's pie scene is
the
best thing in the whole movie, but there's nothing much else.  It's slow
and
unfunny in pretty long stretches.  The sentimental material seems to
overshadow the fact that it's a &quot;raunchy sex comedy&quot;.  It still has
plenty
of gross-out material, but barely any of it makes a big impact on you the
way &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; does, and it's not so funny either.
&quot;Mary&quot; handled sentimental AND gross-out material much better.  It's also
sad that, with the exception of Mena Suvari doing &quot;American Beauty&quot;, none
of
the main young actors who do a favorable job here (Biggs, Chris Klein,
Tara
Reid, Seann W. Scott, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas) have
done
anything good or, in the case of Thomas and Nicholas, anything at all.
Overall, the movie is overrated and unremarkable.<br /><br />** out of ****
