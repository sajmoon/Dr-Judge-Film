I recently watched the Unrated version of American Pie on DVD and it was
quite true to life and very funny. Jim and his cronies try to get laid
before prom which is exactly 3 weeks away. They try through suggested sex,
lies, and a web cam broadcast (not quite videotape). Revealing details
about
the other side of band camp included.
