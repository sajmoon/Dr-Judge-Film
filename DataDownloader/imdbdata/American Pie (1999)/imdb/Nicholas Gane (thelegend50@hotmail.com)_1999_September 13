This is a very funny, funny, funny, funny, funny movie, oh hang on, I think
I may have already said that.....
Ummm now where was I?  Oh yes, this is a funny movie.
As Jason Biggs said in a recent Australian interview, &quot;People like to be
shocked,&quot; and I think if you want to be shocked, you should definetely see
this movie.  It is truly a shocker, but only in the good
sense.<br /><br />I've been waiting to see this movie since I don't know how long, and like so
many other movies that dissapoint you when you finally see them after a
long, long, long wait, this one didn't. I'll admit, I was mainly wanting to
see Alyson Hannigan (Tell me, am I the only one here that watches Buffy the
vampire slayer, for Willow?  She's just such a cute character.) But she
certainly doesn't turn out to be the cute little Willow character that we
all know and love, which was quite interesting, and shocking to see.  I was
going to use the quote: &quot;And this one time, at band camp...&quot; but seeming
someone else has already gone and done that, I won't... (Well, it would
appear that I already have.  Oh well, you get that don't ya?)<br /><br />Well, I can't help myself, I have to say it again..... funny, funny, funny,
funny, funny.....<br /><br />And as the saying goes.... &quot;If you only see one movie this year....&quot;  well
who cares how the saying goes, see what ever movies you want to see, just
make sure you don't miss out on this one......<br /><br />Truly a 12 out of 10 effort.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br /><br />Nick.
