Candy-sweet prom drama. Everyone&#39;s terrified of growing up and sex is
the conducting rod around which plot threads and corporeal gags spark
and squelch. Cleverly, with such a coarse general premise the film
blooms; the strange exchange of revealed insecurity and galvanised
masculinity is sincerely achieved. (Also, with it&#39;s postmodern
appropriation of ideas from a 30-year history of rite-of-passage
flicks, it also manages to pave the way for the parody-anthologies of
the Noughties).<br /><br />So plaudits all-round to a new late 90s brat-pack. The film&#39;s not quite
as delicate or touching as, say, Richard Linklater&#39;s Dazed and
Confused, but you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;ve simply been watching a 90-min
riff on wanking. 6/10
