From the moment I saw the trailer for &quot;American Pie&quot; I knew it would become
a hit. When I saw it back in July 1999, I thought it was hilarious. Although
I had seen &quot;There's something about Mary&quot; I wasn't used to the new trend of
gross out comedies. After seeing American Pie I left the theater laughing
for days. This movie tops the list of gross out comedies and no one should
go without seeing it. It will offend and charm you. It's the &quot;Porky's&quot; of
the 1990s
