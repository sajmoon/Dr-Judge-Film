American Pie is a film that certain people would look at the film's cover
and thing it is not worth to see, well, you're wrong. It has many laughs and
some jokes where you have to pay attention to understand. The film opens
with Jason Biggs (Jim) trying to masturbate (with a tube sock over his
privates) while watching scrambled porn. His mother walks in to put clothes
away and say good night. She personally thinks he's trying to watch illegal
channels so Jim's Dad (that is what they have him listed as in the credits)
comes in and says it is only coming in bad until he here' the man screaming
&quot;Smack my hairy a-- b----.&quot; He immediately rips the pillow off of his son's
lap to find a tube sock over his privates. There are a couple more sick
jokes in there like when Jim's date for the prom says to him to get his
attention &quot;At band camp I once stuck my flute up my p-----.&quot; He freaks out
and she then says &quot;Don't you think I know how to turn myself off. Now I'm
getting antsy. Want to screw?&quot; And a joke about semen in a beer and someone
else drinking it. Also the Internet broadcast of a foreign exchange student
in his room topless and masturbating. In a unique way it has something for
everyone!
