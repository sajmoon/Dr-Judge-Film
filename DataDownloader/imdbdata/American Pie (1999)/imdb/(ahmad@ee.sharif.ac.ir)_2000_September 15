I just figured it out that everybody was chosen very carefully after
watching the movie for the 2nd time. Every character was appearing right
in
time and in the correct place. In addition, the movie is telling the truth
of life in a fantastic voice. It's really a masterpiece in my idea. It
takes
you back to the world we all lived in for some years. &quot;Guys! The big dance
AND graduation are coming up and we still HAVE TO get laid.&quot;
Jim (Jason Biggs) is a bright but socially inept guy whose despair at
being
a virgin only increases his foolishness. He gets little help from his dad
(Eugene Levy); his ideas of sex lectures are to thumb through a copy of
Hustler magazine with his son. When Jim's using his webcam, the movies
reaches its climax. He's playing professionally like a real virgin. The
part
he's trying to make his hair the way girls like is realistic.
However, along the way, a few lessons are learned, and at least a few of
the
boys' questions are answered, balancing most of the film's vulgarity. The
best characters used in real romantic scenes, were Mena Suvari and Chris
Klein. Their appearance was one of my personal favorites which was played
professionally in this movie.
It's the most amuzing sex comedy I have ever reviewed, with the perfect
use
of a vast variety of different characters.<br /><br />-Ahmad Anvari, Movie Reviewer - Tehran, Iran
