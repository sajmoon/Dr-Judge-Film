The first half hour or so of &quot;American Pie&quot; is a pure waste of time, very
boring, very unfunny, very desperate. In fact, the script is more desperate
than the teenagers in this film. However, after thirty minutes or so, the
film gets better, it's even cute at times, but I really don't know what all
the fuss is about. So, teenagers talking about sex, having sex -- who cares?
The funniest character is without a doubt Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) and the
best line (because it was so unexpected) belongs to Alyson Hannigan's geeky
character. Well, not very good, not very bad. Average.
