1999_July 9 

This movie did what WWW couldn't. It was entertaining from start to
finish.
Although this movie follows on the foot steps of Austin Powers 2 and Big
Daddy, I found that it was thoroughly more entertaining. The humor is not
intellectual by any stretch of the imagination (and it wasn't meant to be)
but it was well written and more importantly, well delivered.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a group of friends that make a pact with each
other that they would all lose their virginity by their prom night. What
starts out as a group of guys trying every trick in the book to bed a girl
turns out to be a self discovering journey that is riddled with humor that
keeps you laughing right up to the closing credits. While there are those
out there that may criticize this movie on its content, keep in mind that
it
is rated R and makes no attempt to hide that fact. Parents may be offended
but the reality is that this movie does depict what many teenagers go
through during the final year of high school.<br /><br />All the actors portrayed their roles admirably and a large part can be
attributed to good writing. This movie will attract a lot of the teenage
crowd (at least those that can get in) but I'm sure that adult audiences
will find it just as entertaining. This movie will definitely be compared
to
&quot;Something About Mary&quot; and the simple truth is that AP is much funnier and
well worth the full admission.
