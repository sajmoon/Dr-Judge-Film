This movie, by itself, is hilarious. It&#39;s funny for the younger set
that can immediately relate to the humor that describes, at least on
some level, the world that they live in and for the older set that can
now sit back and laugh at the way that they were (or their friends
were) when they were growing up.<br /><br />It&#39;s got a cast of younger actors who are truly hilarious and then they
also throw in the father, Eugene Levy (sp?) to make things even
funnier. His straight acting to the comedy around him is legendary, and
he shows off his skill in this set of movies.<br /><br />As noted in my tagline, this movie is funny even if you only saw it and
none of the sequels. But where this set of movie excels is in the fact
that there are sequels. It shows not only that they can find fresh
humor with all of the same characters (a winning point to this set of
movies is that it appears that the entire cast returns each time) but
that the characters can actually start to slowly show maturity
throughout the films up until the American Wedding movie.<br /><br />See this movie if you want a good laugh, get all of them if you want to
have a lot of good laughs and if you want to actually see the
characters grow over time.
