Just saw the movie and it was great!!  The humor, acting, everything was
wonderful.  One of the best teen movies I've seen in a while.  While the
guys will enjoy all of the jokes and sex, the girls will appreciate the
fact
that they shouldn't have to be pressured into having sex if they don't
really want to do it. An all-around great movie!!
