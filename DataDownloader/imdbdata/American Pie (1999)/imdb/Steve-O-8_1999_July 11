A few words to describe American Pie: It is a fairly accurate portrayal of
teenage life. It is not intended to impress the &quot;critics&quot; or to be clean.
It
uses the same language that many high school kids use and I believe most
teenagers will be able to see their high school lives unfold on the screen
before them. It essentially copes with the modern-day teenage life.
