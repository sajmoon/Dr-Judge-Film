American Pie is got to be one of the funniest movies of the year.  It is
what kids all over the country try to do at one point in there life.  I
have
to say that I did not find the movie offensive like the reviews said.
There
where a lot of older people in the movie audience that where laughing as
hard as I was.  The movie is not for younger people.  But I highly
recommend it for anyone to see.
