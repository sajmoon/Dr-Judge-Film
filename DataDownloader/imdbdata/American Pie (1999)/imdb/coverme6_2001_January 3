Being a teenager, I couldn't relate to the kids in this movie. I
mean,
would any teen go to crazy lengths to get laid? The image of Jim
doing
something really nasty with a pie was extremely gross. I kept
thinking,
&quot;God, kid, are you crazy or just plain stupid??&quot; The whole point of
this
flick is how a group of teens would do and how in order to lose
their
virginity. But for the most part, it's really exaggerated, like a<br /><br />version of &quot;Kids&quot; written by the creators of &quot;Saturday Night
Live.&quot;
