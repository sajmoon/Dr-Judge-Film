American Pie is about 4 kids trying to &quot;get layed&quot; by the time of the senior
prom. Although things aren't looking so good for them. One can't get a girl,
one gets a girl in a chorus, but isn't interested in that kind of thing, one
almost got a girl but screwed up because the girl was shipped back to her
home place (for good intentions), and one has a girl but wants to get to
know him before they get into &quot;extreme measures.&quot;<br /><br />I thought this was an extremely gross out comedy. It had pretty much
everything a funny movie should have. Although their was soem funny parts,
most of the time (mostly the ending) wasn't that funny. But if you liked
There's Something About Mary, you will like this. Starring Jason Biggs,
Chris Kleine, and Eugene Levy.<br /><br />*** out of ****
