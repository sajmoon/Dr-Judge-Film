1999_August 11 

There are movies for everyone... movies for people who like Drama....
gore... and even harmless vulgar humor.... and believe it be harmless
vulgar
humor is 'American Pie'!
If you do not like movies dealing with such.. then plain and simple 'Dont
Go
See It!' No need in coming on here and telling people they are 'sick in
the
head if you like American Pie' like one reviewer did...<br /><br />Anyways aside from people with rude comments and not taking the fact that
different people like different stuff because just maybe we can deal with
it.... 'American Pie' is hilarious!
It's been a while since I have laughed so much... True it may have a slim
plot but with this kind of movie it only can be expected... so I am rating
this movie very highly recommended, considering it is in its own
genre...<br /><br />Better than the recent 'Theres Somthing About Mary', 'American Pie'
excells
in humor as much as fun! A definite crowd pleaser... I for one know I have
never seen the audience react as wildly or with such togetherness as with
this movie... it was outrageous good fun!<br /><br />The interesting part is that along with 'sick humor' it acually deals
suprisingly well with the slight touches of 'teen' romance and not sinking
to far into just plain lust....<br /><br />Really a treat.. Enjoy it... and don't be afraid to say so... it's worth
fighting for... to keep this as one of the best movies of this year
(1999)... so far...<br /><br />
