If you want comedy then this is the film for you. This is a great film
with powerful performances from Jason Biggs and my favourite Seann
William Scott. A very funny comedy about 4 boys about to leave high
school and are having a pact of loosing their virginity before they
leave. But as any other comedy there's problems and funny occurrences
in every minute. Exelant performances from Chris Klein and Thomas Ian
Nicholas.... 10 out of 10 This is my favourite film. I don't know wot
else to write so I'm just gaining to make words up jg fog coffeecake
