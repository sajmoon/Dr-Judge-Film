2010_May 6 
I&#x27;ve been aware of this movie&#x27;s existence for many years now. Released
in 1999, it&#x27;s a romantic comedy which turned out to be an absolute
success and spawned two sequels, &#x22;American Pie 2&#x22; in 2001, and
&#x22;American Wedding&#x22; in 2003. I even remember listening to the &#x22;American
Wedding&#x22; soundtrack six years ago, but never actually saw any film in
the trilogy until this month, when I finally watched the first one. The
original &#x22;American Pie&#x22; was released the year after &#x22;There&#x27;s Something
About Mary&#x22;, another successful R-rated romantic comedy. I watched that
1998 release earlier this year and really didn&#x27;t get the hype. I knew
this film was a lot like that one, and thought it was slightly better
than its predecessor, but still vastly overrated.<br /><br />Jim Levenstein, Chris &#x22;Oz&#x22; Ostreicher, Kevin Myers, and Paul Finch are
four high school friends who are nearing the end of their senior year.
One of their fellow students is Steve Stifler, a popular sex-crazed
jock who can be very rude and insensitive. After a geeky student named
Chuck Sherman claims to have just had sex, and it appears he is telling
the truth, the four friends are shocked. Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch then
all vow to lose their virginity before graduation. Since they are
convinced that Chuck has had sex before finishing high school, they
figure they obviously can as well. In order to achieve their goal, they
will have to get themselves girlfriends before the senior prom, which
is coming up in three weeks. They don&#x27;t have very much time, so each of
them soon attempts to find a female peer and win her heart, but as the
night of the prom draws nearer, they find that trying to lose their
virginity in time isn&#x27;t so easy.<br /><br />This R-rated comedy is crude and juvenile from the beginning, showing
Jim getting caught watching an explicit channel by his parents, and I
have to admit that this made me laugh. Many more crude gags follow, and
they often made me laugh at least lightly, including the part with
Steve drinking beer which he doesn&#x27;t realize Kevin has ejaculated into,
though I&#x27;m not proud of that, and didn&#x27;t find the scene that soon
follows this, with Steve throwing up in the toilet, very funny. There&#x27;s
even a part showing Jim practicing sex on a pie, and this part probably
wouldn&#x27;t have made me laugh had it not been for his father coming in
and catching him in the act! The scene with Jim&#x27;s Dad, played by Eugene
Levy, giving his son a bunch of porno magazines, and at least one later
scene with this character giving his son sexual advice, also made me
laugh. Levy&#x27;s talent was probably a major reason for this. However,
most of the movie isn&#x27;t THAT funny, and is sometimes pretty lame, even
cruel, such as the part where many students get to see the sexual
activity in Jim&#x27;s room on their computers, and Steve giving Finch
diarrhea and leading him into the girl&#x27;s washroom to let it out, even
if I didn&#x27;t keep a completely straight face throughout these segments.
Finch even has to face Steve and many other students laughing at him
when he comes out of the ladies&#x27; room! I also didn&#x27;t care much for the
characters in general, there&#x27;s nothing too special about them, and very
rarely do I see a movie with such a stupid and uninteresting premise!<br /><br />Some super-raunchy modern comedies are really funny to me, while
certain others have failed to make me laugh even one time while I
watched them. For me, &#x22;American Pie&#x22; came somewhere in between. I did
laugh at times, and I&#x27;ve certainly seen worse excuses for gags than any
of the ones I saw here, but the laughs weren&#x27;t consistent enough, and
the movie certainly has some notably lame segments. Since there were
parts I found funny, even if that&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing, I
give this juvenile R-rated romantic comedy a 6/10, but thinking about
all the lameness I saw in it, I get the feeling even this rating is a
little too generous. Unsurprisingly, nothing here made me feel the same
way as the zipper accident in &#x22;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&#x22; (I&#x27;ve said
in previous reviews that nothing else in any movie ever has), but like
that 1998 comedy, I really don&#x27;t think this one deserved its massive
success.
