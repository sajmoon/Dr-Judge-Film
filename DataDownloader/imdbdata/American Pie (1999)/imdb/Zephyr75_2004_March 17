If i'm in the mood for a sexy good time as far as film goes, then I know I
can count on my copy of American Pie. It's the one movie that i've watched
time and time again since it was first released on dvd, and have found it
to
be interesting each time I see it. Truthfully my all time favorite scene
has
to be Jim and Nadia in his bedroom, and her making him strip for the
unbeknowest to her camera. This is the one film that can now be landmarked
as an american treasure right along with the classic Animal House. Of
course
the two are totally different films, but good old natured fun in both
aspects. Another thing I loved about AP was the ensemble casting. It's
like
looking at my own circle of friends that I went to high school with.
That's
another reason for my liking this film so much, just for the pure
reflection
of it all, and the overall genius in the humor.
