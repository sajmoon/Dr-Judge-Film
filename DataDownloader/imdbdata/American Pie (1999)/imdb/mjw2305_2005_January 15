Since the likes of &#39;Animal house&#39; and &#39;Porky&#39;s&#39; i&#39;ve waiting for
another movie that confronts the funny side of of teenage life, in
particular the sexual dilemmas we all have to face at some point in our
teens. (I hope not to many people deal with them quite like this
though) American Pie delivers exactly this and plenty more. With some
truly hilarious characters and some terrific dialogue, this film will
have you in stitches, and contains scenes that will be laughed about
for years.<br /><br />As teen comedy films go, this is up there with the best of them, highly
recommended 9/10
