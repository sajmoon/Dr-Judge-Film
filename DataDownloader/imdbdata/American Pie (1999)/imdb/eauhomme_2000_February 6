&quot;American Pie&quot; takes a strikingly original premise and makes several
interesting twists and turns with it. That is: A bunch of teenage boys want
to get laid and end up getting caught in a few embarassing situations as a
result.<br /><br />No, there isn't a lot to this movie--indeed, it is an updated
&quot;Porky's&quot;-type
movie, with the exception that the characters in Porky's were better
developed and this movie takes place at a high school only and with no real
central conflicting &quot;Porky&quot;-type villain.<br /><br />To the movie's credit, there are several great laughs in it--the jokes are
in general quite original. It's just that they do not add together into
anything of substance.
