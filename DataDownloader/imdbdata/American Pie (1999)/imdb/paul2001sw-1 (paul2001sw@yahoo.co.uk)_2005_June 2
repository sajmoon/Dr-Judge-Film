The American high school, as depicted in modern comedy, is a strange
place indeed: full of over-aged, foul mouthed jocks and sexy,
self-aware young women and what's more, every one of them is affluent.
In a country where many real schools have metal detectors on the doors
to keep out firearms, it's a relentlessly aspirational world, which,
for all the cruelty and anguish on display, the target teen-aged
audience can dream that they belong to. In addition, for all the toilet
humour, it's a profoundly conservative world as well. 'American Pie',
for example, may set new lows (if that's how you want to consider them)
in toilet humour, but fundamentally this is a film about the joys of
belonging; belonging with your friends, your lovers, even belonging
with your decidedly weird father. In this narrative, the fear of
isolation is eventually banished through the mere possession of an
essentially good heart. Real outsiders, if they appear at all, appear
only as losers, virtually labelled as the child-abusers of the next
generation in punishment for their failure to learn how to fit in.<br /><br />In fact, viewed in these terms, 'American Pie' is far from the most
offensive film in it's genre, with a little less smug sanctimoniousness
behind the smut than is usual in such fare. Unfortunately, it's just
not that funny. The plot is simple: four guys try to get laid, and the
absence of real narrative reduces the film to a series of set pieces
devoid of real context. Even the eponymous pie gag isn't even
particularly gross, and there's none of the offbeat charm of 'There's
Something About Mary' (which aimed at a slightly older audience and
which I found rather funnier than I like to admit). The success of
films like this is all about selling a lifestyle: this is a film about
how the average teenager might like to lose their virginity. Real life
is darker, but also, often funnier as well.
