This was definitely better than that *other* teen sex comedy to which it's
been compared (&quot;Porky's&quot;), but the funny bits just could not make up for
the
series of cliches and sight gags that it was. This isn't good,
self-conscious potty humor of the &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; variety;
this is more along the lines of little kids snickering at hearing
&quot;poo-poo.&quot;
Sure, there were amusing parts, but those were so contrived (as bad
scripts
tend to be), the laughter wasn't of the unstoppable sides-aching type. And
really, the stories behind those gags were just so cliched (not even
trying
to do something new and creative with old cliches!) and boringly executed,
I
felt like I was watching a paint-by-numbers movie. If you want a really
truly funny hilarious crazy sex comedy, try Woody Allen's &quot;Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About Sex but were afraid to ask.&quot; This achieves
that
racy NC-17-ness to which &quot;American Pie&quot; aspires, but with much more
cleverness.
