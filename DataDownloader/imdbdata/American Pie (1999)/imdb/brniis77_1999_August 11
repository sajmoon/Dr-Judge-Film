1999_August 11 

When I went to the theatre with my boyfriend to see this movie, we
both
got carded!  I couldn't believe it..her we are 22 &amp; 25 respectively, and
we
are getting carded for a movie...this one must be really raunchy I
thought.
I was right!
For anyone who liked &quot;Something About Mary&quot;, you will definitely like
this one.  It had me laughing so much, I almost fell off my
seat...literally!  There is one scene in particular that had me gagging
and
trying not to throw-up, both from laughing and from the grossness of the
scene.
There is not much more to say than GO SEE THIS MOVIE with out giving
out the details of the movie.  You won't be disappointed!<br /><br />
