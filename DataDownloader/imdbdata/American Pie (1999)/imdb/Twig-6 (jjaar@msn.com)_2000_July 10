I thought is was a great Movie, But was Under Rate by many people, this
movie is more of people late teens, 20's, 30's maybe 40's, i wouldn't sit
my
Grandparents in front of it.<br /><br />But the film its self is true, this all happens to the older teens, in many
countries, i don't know about your country. the story line was the
greatest,
of one of the group says he lost his virginity by spending the night in the
same room as one of the girls and which causes the Pact, in the end it was
nothing more than talking.<br /><br />i have given this film 9/10 because i think it needed something else, but i
not sure what though
