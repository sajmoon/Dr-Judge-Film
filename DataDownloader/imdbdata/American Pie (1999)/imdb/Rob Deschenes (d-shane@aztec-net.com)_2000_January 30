For a teenage movie that approaches very touchy topics, this is still a
lighthearted movie. After a big loser loses his virginity to a nice woman,
four boys make a pact to lose theirs by the prom. Their only inspiration:
themselves. The movie seems to drag as the poor guys try some pretty stupid
tactics, but the highlight has to be Nadia in Jim's room. Throughout the
rest of the movie it's that moment and the &quot;warm apple pie&quot; that will go
through your head. In the end, it's all dumb and obvious because it's only a
movie with either a &quot;you win all or you suck&quot; attitude. But next to that,
it's a movie for the times, as boys of this era are becoming sensitive for
the wrong reasons to become &quot;men.&quot;
