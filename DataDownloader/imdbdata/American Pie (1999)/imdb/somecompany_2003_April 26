In 1997, a little horror film called 'Scream' came along and blew<br /><br />our minds away with it's great writing and twists and turns. It<br /><br />breathed life into the fledgling (read: bad) horror genre, made<br /><br />money and became something of a cult classic. So, that's one<br /><br />genre ticked up a notch, let's name another failed genre: The teen<br /><br />movie. The 80's were the hey day for the T&amp;A flicks. You had the<br /><br />excellent 'Porky's' and the absolutely classic 'National Lampoon's<br /><br />Animal House' and add to that more quieter down to earth yet still<br /><br />raunchy John Hughes teen flicks like 'Sixteen Candles' or 'Weird<br /><br />Science'. When anyone mentions film in the 80's, it is always the<br /><br />teen flicks that stand out amongst the bunch but, alas, they have<br /><br />failed us in more recent years so in 1999, a film came along made<br /><br />by the unknown Weitz Brothers (who would go on to make 'About a<br /><br />Boy') with a script by Adam Herz that would breath life into the teen<br /><br />genre much like 'Scream' with the horror genre. Sadly, though,<br /><br />'American Pie' pales when compared to such a classic like<br /><br />'Porky's' and, ultimately, 'American Pie' is a good script that worked<br /><br />well on paper but gets kind of boring on screen. MInd you, Jason<br /><br />Biggs and Sean William Scott were actually impressive and<br /><br />comedy genuis Eugene Levy gave his is best performance that he<br /><br />topped with 'Serendipity' in 2001. 'American Pie' isn't really a bad<br /><br />movie, it's just that it stretches too far just to get to one meagre<br /><br />joke about any form of sex imaginable. Of course, it has some real<br /><br />good laughs in it and is worth at least one viewing in your
lifetime.
