I can't understand why so many people likes this film. It's one of the
most stupid films ever made, that belongs to the stupid-film movement
of the 90's and 2000's (Big Momma's House, Scary Movie, Deuce Bigalow:
European Gigolo). This kind of films have a lot of non sense jokes
about sex or any idiot thing you like. For example, every time they say
&quot;boobs&quot; or &quot;pinus&quot; the whole audience start to laugh. Why? It's all
part of the human nature and sex is a serious thing. If you are a
Person that likes quality films, a warning: don't watch this. Please I
don't want more stupid comedies made by people who are thinking just in
sex, sex, sex. Common.
