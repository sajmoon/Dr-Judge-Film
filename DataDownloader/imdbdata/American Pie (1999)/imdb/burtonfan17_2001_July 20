&quot;American Pie&quot; is a film that has been taken at face value by most of its
target audience.  To many, it is simply a film about four friends trying to
get laid before they graduate high school and go on to bigger and better
things (well, maybe, let's see the sequel).  But I believe that the writers
and the concievers had something else in mind.  If they wanted to do another
sex comedy, they could have done a remake of &quot;Losin' It&quot; or &quot;Porky's&quot; or
something else from the '80s.  Instead, they found a way to incorporate
those entertaining tactics into a film with a finely developed coming-of-age
message.  The sex part is really just to keep the viewer watching. <br /><br />I'm pretty sure that I'm right because 90% of the people I have talked to
that are part of a face-value generation have said that &quot;there's something
there&quot; and that it &quot;has a message&quot;.  <br /><br />&quot;American Pie&quot; could be called an organized sex comedy.  But I think it's an
organized drama.  The ending was a fine one--something that I could relate
to as I am saying goodbye to my friends in High School and heading onto
bigger and better things.  Yep, I guess I'm starting the second film of my
life, and maybe we all will understand the message of &quot;American Pie&quot; when we
finish it.  Anyway, highly recommended.
