1999_October 26 

I saw this movie for the third time last night and must say that it gets
better every time I see it.  True, it is vulgar and disgusting, but it is
great fun.  It is truly a movie about the youth of America.  It is
hilarious
and will not leave you disappointed.  This is one slice of pie that you do
not want to leave untouched if you crave a delicious comedy.
