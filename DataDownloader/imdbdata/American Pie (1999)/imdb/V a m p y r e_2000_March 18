What a great film. I recommend it, especially the Region 1 DVD Unrated
Version. The film is hilarious, and some of the things that happen within
the film ....<br /><br />The best DVD available at the moment, excluding the Matrix. Lots of extra's
including out takes and a version useful music thing. That allows you to
play the soundtrack within the film.<br /><br />Great, watch it today.
