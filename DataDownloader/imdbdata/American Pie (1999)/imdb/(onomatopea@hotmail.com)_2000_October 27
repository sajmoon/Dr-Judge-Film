A supposed continuation of risqu&eacute; early eighties frat comedies such as
Porky's, this rather slicker and bigger budgeted studio offering made its
money through several hyped up gross-out gags that ultimately belie the
films true intentions. Unlike its predecessors, American Pie is never
prepared to venture into true bad taste territory, preferring instead to
supplant its raunchiness with a desperately twee undercurrent. Scenes of
almost gruesome sentimentality are often sandwiched between the
cringe-inducing moments which provide the occasional (but genuine) laughs,
and the old fashioned values that end up being preached simply stand out
as
heavy handed in light of the nature of the material and of teenagers in
general. There are amusing segments and good performances all round,
especially from Eugene Levy's 50's throwback father figure, but second
time
around the flaws stand out awkwardly. Many of the maudlin moments will
undoubtedly end up being fast-forwarded through on video.<br /><br />2 1/2 out of 5.
