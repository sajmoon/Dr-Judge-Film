1999_November 4 

I cannot praise this film enough.  I hadn't even really heard about it but
when I saw it I could not stop laughing.  It has a superb storyline,
something every boy (and some girls) can relate to.  It has a sensational
cast, most are very little known, and a pumpin' soundtrack.  In particular
Bic Runga 'Sway'.  (hey shes a new zealander what do you expect me to
say???).  I give this film a big 12 out of 10 and I cannot wait to see this
one again.  Warning to guys.  Don't take your girlfriend to this one.  Go
with the boys.
