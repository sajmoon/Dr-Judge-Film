I just LOVED this movie! It is the funniest and sickest and most shocking
film I have EVER seen! Funnier than The Pink Panther! Sicker than Cannibal
Holocaust! More shocking than Salo! It is a MASTERPIECE! I loved the MTV-pop
music ridden soundtrack! Far better than the score to The Empire Strikes
Back or Conan the Barbarian anyday! I also love vinyl pants and butterfly
stickers on my car and Chinese tattoos on the back of my shoulder! I just
got myself a leopard purse and a skin tight leopard shirt! I just put on My
Dave Matthews Band CD right before I typed this! Off to the fraternity house
I go!<br /><br />Stereotypes abound! Obviously, the only sort of biped a film like this would
appeal to. I can't wait for 2 more years to pass by, when all the &quot;stars&quot; of
this movie join the &quot;out&quot; crowd of trendy cinema like Corey Feldman, Corey
Haim, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald.... Cyclical, isn't it?
