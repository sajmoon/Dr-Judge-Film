I already made my feelings heard about this movie back in April (if you look
you will find it among the messages), giving it two stars out of four.  Now
with the upcoming release of the sequel (complete with ads and entertainment
shows saying how good the first one was) bringing the original back to my
memory, it deserves less credit.  The actors were actually worse then I
thought they were, and the &quot;morals&quot; at the end were so cheap.  Of course, I
still believe that it's unfunny in long stretches and pales in comparison to
&quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;.
