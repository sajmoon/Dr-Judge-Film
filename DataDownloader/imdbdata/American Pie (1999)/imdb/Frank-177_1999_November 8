1999_November 8 

At last a movie that shakes the basic American moral around!<br /><br />Everybody knows that under that Holier Than Thou-facade, American teenage
kids have the same needs and urges as the rest of us.<br /><br />Not only is &quot;American Pie&quot; funny and clever, it is also breaking taboos and
boundaries that was unheard of in Hollywood just a few years ago. It is also
refreshing with a line of fresh faces both behind and in front of the
camera. I recommend this movie to all mature audiences.
