Hi,<br /><br />It was a good movie, well worth watching, although maybe a little too
&quot;sexual&quot;. However, it is not so suitable for children... For some strange
reason, the movie was rated &quot;Barntill&aring;ten&quot; in Sweden, which means allowed
for all ages.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Daniel Hofverberg
