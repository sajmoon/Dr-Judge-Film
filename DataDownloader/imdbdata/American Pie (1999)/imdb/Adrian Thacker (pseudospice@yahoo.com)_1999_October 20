So &quot;American Pie&quot; was not as drop-dead hysterical as everyone told me it
was. But it was quite funny nonetheless. We've seen the story before - the
teenage virgin guys make a pact to get laid before prom. But what's
different about this one is that it doesn't happen the same way it did in
all of those eighties sex comedies. The characters are three dimensional
with feelings and surprises, and you find yourself liking most if not all of
the characters. The acting is pretty good, and the actors did have a good
script to work with, which makes it easier. Quite a few memorable moments. A
little bit crude for some, but perfect for the more mature teens.
8/10
