American Pie is not the type of movie who doesn't like disgusting and crude
jokes. Teenagers will adore this movie, especially young boys. But the
movie
does make you laugh and shocked. It is much like Something About Mary, but
funnier and makes more sense.<br /><br />Plot: 4 high school senior boys, that are friends, make a pact that they
will lose their virginity before graduation. From there wackiness
happens.<br /><br />Views:Adults without a sense of humor will not like this movie!! But if you
have an open mind and like to laugh, give this movie a chance. Somethings
in
the movie are gross and foul but they make the movie all the more
interesting.<br /><br />Scenes to watch for: That infamous pie scene, the party at the beginning of
the movie, after the prom.
