1999_August 11 

I am so sick of some of the crap that hollywood has put out in the past
years that is supposed to be funny.  American Pie had me laughing
throughout
the whole film.  As a high school graduate, I can relate to the humor in
this movie, as should anybody (especially male) who attended high school
and
has a sense of humor. Not all guys are like the actors in the movie.  But
most guys that I have met in high school and college remind me of some
scene
in the movie.  Of course some of the scenes were absolutely ridiculous and
unrealistic but were very funny as long as you were able to take the humor
for what it was worth.  I left the theater with a big grin on my face and
did not feel that I spent my money unwisely.
