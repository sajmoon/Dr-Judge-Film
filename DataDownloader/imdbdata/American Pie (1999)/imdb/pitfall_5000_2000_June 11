My God, was I angry after I saw this!!  I expected soooooo much more than
this piece of garbage!  I talked to my friends about this, and I got a
stunned silence when I told them I hated it.  What is so appealing about
this movie?  Let's do a pro quo, shall we?
Pro-Nudity, Soundtrack, Hot chicks
Quo-Bad Jokes, Horrible acting, Bad Plot, Stupid dialogue....A bad idea
all around!
People would think, &quot;Oh, this guy must be old not to have liked this
movie!&quot;  I'm 16.  I hated this crummy movie.  A complete waste of my
time.
Final Thought:  Buy a copy and burn it!
