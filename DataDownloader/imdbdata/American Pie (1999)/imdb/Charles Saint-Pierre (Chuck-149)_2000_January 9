  I know what most adults are thinking when somebody talks to them about
&quot;American pie&quot;.  They believe it's some stupid comedy only about young kids
who want to have sex before graduating.  Well, that's not what it is about. 
Indeed, there is much more to the movie than just four kids wanting to have
sex.  There is a story of relationships between friends as well as a big
sports theme (lacrosse particularly).  This is not only crude humor, it
isn't slap-stick all the time.  It has some very intelligent
moments.<br /><br />  The movie begins with a strong beginning.  Jim (Jason Biggs) is jacking
off in his room as he is watching an illegal channel when suddenly, without
any warning, his mother comes in.  This scene gives you a pretty good
impression of just how much you will probably laughing through the movie. 
We then move on to Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who already has a girlfriend,
Vickie (Tara Reid), but have been at the same level of their relationship
for quite some time now.  There is also Chris (Chris Klein) who is a
Lacrosse player and is too insensitive to maintain any relationship with a
girl.  And finally, there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who is the fourth
friend and doesn't try to hook up with girls that much.  But when the four
guys make a pact to get laid before they graduate, they all become
enthusiastic.<br /><br />  First time-directors Chris and Paul Weitz do a great job with &quot;American
pie&quot;.  They seem to remember pretty well what their high-school graduation
must have been like because the prom scene seems to be recreated in the
exact same way it was for them.  They also seemed to know exactly when to
cut the comic scenes perfectly so that they don't put too much and turn
their jokes into stupid jokes.  Also to be mentioned as supporting actors
are Sean W. Scott as Stifler, Natasha Lyonne as Jessica and Eugene Levy as
Jim's dad.  It's a great movie with great humor and I highly recommend
it.
