A classic in its own right, American Pie is a hilarious sex comedy that
is mostly true to life. While all of the sequels are much better than
the first installment, the first one is not to be missed because it
started it all. The casting is amazing, ...(read more)because without
Alyson Hannigan, Jason Biggs, and Sean William Scott, the movie would
not be anywhere near as good. The writing and the characters really
draw you in, and things are real to life while also cleverly mocking
teenagers and their way of thinking. The plot is highly original for
when it was made--by now it has been copied and mocked numerous times.
The movie is so easy to like, and, as stated before, all of the sequels
are better than the first one. See this before this others because it&#39;s
not disappointing in the least.
