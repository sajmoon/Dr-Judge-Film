1999_July 15 

If for some reason you just really, really, _really_ want to see this
movie
in theaters, then by all means do so. But, if you aren't sure if you can
believe the hype on this movie, wait until its on video. In fact, wait
until
it's off the new release wall so you're only sinking two bucks into seeing
it. Better yet, walk right on by the &quot;A&quot;s, and head straight for the &quot;P&quot;s,
pick up Porky's, and go home. It will be the same premise, only executed
far, far better. And since I'm turning this into a rant... Please, please,
_please_ stop comparing this movie to &quot;Something About Mary&quot;. (I'm a
little
leery of comparing it to &quot;Porky's&quot;.) &quot;Something...&quot; was a well written,
intelligent comedy that, while generously laden with &quot;toilet jokes&quot;, did
not
use such humor as the foundation, purpose, and selling point for the
movie.
Take away the hair scene and you still have a love story. Take away the
pie,
and what do you have? Not much. Not much at all. Now that I'm done writing
this, I've decided that, much like &quot;Wing Commander&quot;, I just can't
recommend
that anyone see this movie. I can't have that on my conscience.
...<br /><br />Nah, I'm being too nice. This movie sucked. It sucked hard.
