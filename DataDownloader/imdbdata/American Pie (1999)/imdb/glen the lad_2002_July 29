I normally run away when I'm near teen movies even quicker when they are a
comedy. Yet I sat and watched it and found it a bit of a crude teehee. One
things that stood out was how much it was like me and my mates. The average
joe, the posh camp one, sporty one, cute ok one with a gf and the dumb loud
jerk half friend who you dont really like and cant get rid of. I'll let you
guess which one I am. It's a hard life when you are a young male and you
can't find 'it' for love nor money. So watch it and think back at the
best/worst years of your life.
