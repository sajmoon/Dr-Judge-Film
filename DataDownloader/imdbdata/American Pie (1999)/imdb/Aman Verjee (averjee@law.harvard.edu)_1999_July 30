1999_July 30 

The latest in a line of gross-out comedies that rely on outrageous events
as opposed to comedic sophistication. But while the brilliant comedy of
SOUTH PARK has social relevance and wit, this is just outrageous.<br /><br />At least the gross-out comedy THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY has a steady
drumbeat of humorous events. AMERICAN PIE has an occasionally funny moment
followed by long stretches of tedium, revolving around four high-school guys
trying to get laid.
