Excellent cast of characters. Some of these kids, each of us will identify
with. If you haven't seen this movie yet, WATCH it! 4 sexually deprived
teenage boys, band together in a pact to resolve their virginity by prom
night. The fun all happens on the way &amp; you won't believe how some of these
kids &quot;angle&quot; to get sex. Jim leads the comedy meaning of &quot;American Pie&quot;. The
girls in the film are equally outrageous, so don't think this is strictly a
guy movie. For anyone who lived through puberty, you'll definitely identify
with this movie. Thumbs WAY up!
