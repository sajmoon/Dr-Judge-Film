American Pie is so hilarious. Just like There's something about Mary of
1998. You go to the movies expecting an average movie and you never stop
laughing. Every scene is so fun... All the actors play their part very
seriously, adding to the fun (it's not a Jim Carrey type of comedy), so
there's no reason not to watch it... you won't regret it!!
