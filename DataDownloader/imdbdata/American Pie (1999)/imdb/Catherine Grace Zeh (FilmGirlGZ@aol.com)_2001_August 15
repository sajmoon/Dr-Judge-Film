Even though I thought AMERICAN PIE was okay, it is a very vulgar and crass
movie! Okay, even though I thought it was okay, I'm going to vomit if I see
this one more time! The one thing I hated most was the nudity -- Especially
when Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) was pleasuring herself on Jim's (Jason Biggs)
bed. The reason I found this  was because she had no top on. In my opinion,
this movie had very little humor. The one thing I really liked was the prom.
Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, &quot;If I ever have kids of my own, I'm
not going to let them see this movie until they're grown up.&quot; Now, in
conclusion, I'd like to say, &quot;Parents, don't let your children see this
until they're grown up!&quot;
