1999_July 17 

This gross-out coming of age story is funny in spots, but it lacks the
comic
inspiration that made &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; so outstanding.  Most
of the gags in &quot;American Pie&quot; are just gross without bothering to be funny
(e.g., a kid mistakes a cup of urine for beer, drinks it, then throws up
on
his girlfriend. ha, ha, ha.  There's also a scene in which one of the
characters is shown having diarrhea in the school lavatory, complete with
sound effects.  The scene has no other reason than just pushing the
envelope
of movie grossness.).  The famous &quot;money scene&quot; of the movie in which an
apple pie is used as an onanistic prop was funnier when I read about it
than
when I actually saw it (the scene also owes a lot to Phillip Roth's novel
&quot;Portnoy's Complaint,&quot; in which the masturbation-obsessed title character
has a go with a piece of liver intended for the family's dinner.)  The
young
characters in the movie are appealing and that alone keeps the movie
mildly
enjoyable.  The funniest scenes are those that are the least gross: Jim's
Dad tries to explain the birds and the bees;  Finch and his friend's sexy
mom (who is like Mrs. Robinson on 'ludes) go about seducing each other
(Mom:
The scotch is aged 18 years, just the way I like them.)
