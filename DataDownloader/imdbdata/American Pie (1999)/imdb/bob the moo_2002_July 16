A group of high school friends make a pact to lose their virginity before
the night of their prom.  Each has differing degrees of good fortune and
goes after girls of different types (and ages) in their quest.  However the
perils of that first time are all too evident.<br /><br />The next step in gross out teen comedies was a film entirely focused on
dirty jokes and rude set ups.  The plot can be described in one line but
really isn't even as complex as all that.  However what it does do is allow
many funny scenes to be placed one after another &#150; from the premature scene
to the frothy beer to the pie itself.  The problem is that, unless you are
in the mood for really bad taste comedy then you'll probably hate
this.<br /><br />The jokes and scenes are all crude and it's hard not to get taste fatigue
during the film.  There are lucky moments of refreshing available &#150; the best
of which is Levy as Jim's Dad &#150; providing the innocent lines that are like a
breeze in a smelly room!  The teenage cast are al alright but only Suvari
and Scott standout as reasonable hopes for the future.<br /><br />Overall &#150; very funny if your taste is somewhere between poor to
non-existent. If you want wit, humour or subtlety then you'll be well served
to go else where.
