This film was hyped up so much that it was impossible for it to live up to
expectations. However, friends who saw it said it was &quot;hilarious&quot; and so I
was quite eager to see it.<br /><br />This film, in the main, is not &quot;hilarious.&quot; It has several very funny
moments, but with a premise such as this (teenage boys seeking to lose
their
virginity) you'd think there would have been many more funny moments.
That's
not to say that the writers were stingy with the jokes, but rather that
only
a small proportion of the gags were actually laugh-aloud
moments.<br /><br />In the end, it's an average teen comedy that could have been so much more.
If you want to see a genuinely funny comedy then see &quot;There's Something
About Mary&quot; which is twice the movie this is.<br /><br />5/10.
