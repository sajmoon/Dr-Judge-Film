1999_July 9 

First of all, yes, I'm twenty years old and fell right into that minority
of
people who could honestly relate to this film.  Not that I ever was in any
of the situations, but...oh nevermind.  But I thought that it was a great
movie for people my age--sure, it was a bit overblown, but it was a
comedy,
remember that!!  the truth is that kids do think about sex, and by the end
of the movie they've made the subtle point that it's not all it's cracked
up
to be.  sure, along the way they make it seem like the best thing ever,
but
in the changes in all the characters, the message is clear--kids may have
hormones, but they're capable of real feelings and emotions.  I thought
the
acting was great--I've seen a few people's comments on here ripping on the
acting.  All I can say is that these kids acted like real kids. I totally
believed that they were people I could have gone to school with.  As for
some people's comments that Natasha Lyonne was the best thing in this
movie,
all I want to ask is why is it that so-called &quot;film buffs&quot; always denounce
the acting of every teenager in a film like this, except the eccentric,
anti-social one?  Honestly.  I understand that Lyonne really stood out in
this movie, and she was good, but she was hardly the best thing in it.  I
hate to make personal comments about people on here, but I think that if
you're too old to appreciate the accuracy and humor (yes, slightly
overblown
and disgusting humor, but high school humor) of this movie, you really
shouldn't be commenting.<br /><br />Great job on this movie.  The most fun one I've seen in a long time.  8
out
of 10.
