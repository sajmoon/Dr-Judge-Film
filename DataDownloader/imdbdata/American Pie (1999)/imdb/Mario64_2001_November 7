American Pie is funny but it also manages to be sweet, sort of. Well it's
mostly crude humor in a story about four guys who creat a pact to get laid
before high school is over. I laughed out loud a few times and there was a
number of smaller laughs. The pie scene is a classic scene in my mind. It
also is in the line of movies like There's Something About Mary (though not
quite as funny as that movie) that go for both shock value and comedy and
work well. I give it a 7 out of 10. I saw the sequel and I would put it a
hair behind this one.
