Not only did this movie satisfy my needs for it, but I really enjoyed every
second. American Pie isn't your normal 90 minute teen movie with moderate
sexual content, its a teen movie with all the proper tools. It knows how to
satisfy the audience with non-stop laughs. My Take: 9/10.<br /><br />My MPAA rating: R for strong sexual content and dialogue, language, and
drinking-all involving teens.
