This film is funny. It takes what high school kids do to the extreme. But I
doubt anyone ever tried to do what they did before. More or less with the
pie. But I am not to sure if
they will copy after. It is a must see, but not with mom and dad. More with
a buddy and buddy. But beware you will laugh and feel ashamed at the
hyjinx.
Great film.
