This is a movie for people who are able to let go of themselves for a while
and just laugh like crazy at crazy people doing crazy things. This might not
be the most original movie ever made but it has some original ideas in it,
for example I've never seen a guy humping a pie recently. I think some
people misunderstands this movie, it's not so much about how teenagers act
these days it's more a parody of and an exaggeration of what young people
growing up go through. It's not supposed to be about what society is like,
it's supposed to make fun of what society is becoming.  When you watch this
one, for maximum pleasure drop all your morals and intelligence for 90
minutes and just sit back and enjoy a hilarious flick.
