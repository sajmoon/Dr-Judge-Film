2004_February 1 

My comments and feelings about this movie are best summed up by the
sarcastic sentiments of Sideshow Bob from the Simpsons:<br /><br />&quot;That was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to
retch.&quot;<br /><br />Where should I begin? I've never liked teen movies, but I decided to give
this one a chance. Why? My friends, who normally have very good taste in
movies, highly recommended it. Needless to say, I've never trusted their
opinion on any movie ever again. While they sat, enjoyed the movie, and
laughed, I rolled my eyes and checked my watch.<br /><br />Is having sex with a pie supposed to be funny? Are the raging libidos of a
group of teen-aged boys a good focal point for a movie plot? It could be,
if
it weren't so poorly executed.<br /><br />After leaving the movie, and expressing my dislike, I was told that the
movie was &quot;for boys, and not for girls.&quot; If poorly acted, poorly scripted,
horribly directed movies with boring and childish humor are for men and
not
women, then I'm joining a feminist group!
