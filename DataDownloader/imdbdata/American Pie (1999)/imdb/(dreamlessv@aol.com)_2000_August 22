      I'll be frank, I'm suprised to see all the phrase for the movie.  I
(and I am a 14 year old) thought this movie was a long, stupid, immature,
unfunny joke that just didn't know when to stop.  The writers thought that
each gag would be funnier than the last.  They were wrong.  The movie was
nothing but unoriginal, uninspired sight-gags which tried to show a &quot;human&quot;
side (in a film that exploits your most deeply &quot;human&quot; urges) by playing
some sappy music and showing some teens have sex (am I the only who, after
all the references to condoms, noticed no one seemed to be having protected
sex?) could make up for a retarted bore of a movie.
