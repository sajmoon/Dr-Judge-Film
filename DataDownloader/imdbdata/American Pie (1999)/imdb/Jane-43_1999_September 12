American Pie, is not one of those typical teenage movies, it actually deals
with the things we want to hear about, me being an 18 year old- first year
out girl, knows that senior year was so about all the stuff American Pie
deals with!! It is hilarious and I would also say that it's not a movie you
go to see with your boyfriend or girlfriend (or your parents!) It has only
just opened here in Aus. and already me and my friends have been to see it 3
times! I love the movie and the actors are awesome- especially Chris Klein.
If your a teenager and don't mind a bit of gross, sexual related humour,
then you'll LOVE American Pie
