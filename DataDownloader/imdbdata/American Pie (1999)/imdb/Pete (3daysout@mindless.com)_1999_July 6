1999_July 6 

GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!  I went in with high expectations based on
comments
made by other friends that already saw it, and I wasn't let down.  The
laughs kept coming throughout the whole movie, and on many occasions I
missed dialogue since the audience was laughing so loud from what just
happened.  I don't want to give away any of the plot, although it's not
very
complex.  I saw this with 3 guys and 3 girls, and everyone loved it.
Don't
take kids to see this, unless you want to explain practically everything
about sex...  I won't be surprised if this movie does extremely well.
