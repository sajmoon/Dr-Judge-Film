2000_January 8 

A film worthy of repeated viewing again and again, and the nudity is not the
reason.  It's a movie written expressly by guys for guys, but somehow women
like it as much as men do.  The movie has so many scenes of absolutely
hideous embarrassment alternated with scenes of triumph.  There were
somewhere around ten times in the movie when I started shaking my fist and
going, &quot;Yeah, baby!&quot;  Why?  Becausen this is a movie that so many guys my
age (I'm 18) can relate to.  We cringe with embarrassment beyond what we've
ever known when we see Kevin get caught spouting off about trying for a
sexual homerun; we cheer when we see the guy get the girl not because she
coerced him into saying &quot;I love you&quot; but because he truly was interested in
her.  This is immensely gratifying for us to see, partially because we never
see it in real life.  For fans of the movie &quot;Swingers&quot; I would highly
recommend this as a guy movie.  <br /><br />Storywise, this is very well written.  As noted above, there are some
similarities to &quot;Swingers&quot; - obvious scenes when you can't help but feel
sorry for the guy acting too effeminate or being too much of a pushover - to
be contrasted with scenes (like Mike's dancing in Swingers) where you want
to stand up and cheer.  It's the tension between these moments of &quot;I can't
watch this!&quot; to &quot;You just learned how to be a man!&quot; that gives this movie
its great appeal to me.  When I first heard of the movie, I swore that I
would never see it.  I heard of scenes with a pie, of awkward porno-magazine
distribution scenes, of the endlessly repeated &quot;Band Camp&quot; lines, and of a
guy using a tube sock to encase something other than his foot.  Yes, these
are indeed gross, but you must realize they are realistic gross.  Whether or
not they cross into gratuitousness is up to you, but I feel that this film's
reputation as &quot;The Most Dangerous Film to Our Youth of All Time&quot; is
undeserved.  The gross scenes appeal only to the easily-titillated, or
social reformers who need an excuse to impose some more limits on what we
watch.  Watch it for yourself, and how you really think.  You'll find it
worthwhile.
