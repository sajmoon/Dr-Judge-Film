1999_September 17 

Not since &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; have I laughed so hysterically in a
movie theatre. <br /><br />This teenage comedy about a group of four senior high school students trying
to lose their virginity is the funniest thing ever.<br /><br />From maximising the wonders of the internet, to a cup of beer that has a
strange distinctive taste, this movie will have you in
stitches.<br /><br />This new method of gross out humour, has become very successful in recent
years. Started off by the Farrely brothers, it has branched out and as this
movie shows, has become very entertaining.<br /><br />Now, there are some people out there that may be offended with this movie,
they may turn their heads and become disgusted with it...........but hey,
who cares about those uptight repressed morons. <br /><br />This movie is FANTASTIC, I loved it I'm gonna watch it again, a laugh again,
and again and again.<br /><br />GO SEE IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT, IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
