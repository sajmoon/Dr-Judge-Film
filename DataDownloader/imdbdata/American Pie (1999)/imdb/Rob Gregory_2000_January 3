When I first caught the trailers for American Pie I thought that it was
going to be too crude.  There was no doubt that this film would make
Something About Mary seem like a Disney flick.  But now, in the comfort of
my own home, having just witnessed the DVD version of American Pie, I have
to say that it is an excellent movie.  Having been raised on films by the
Zucker brothers and Mel Brooks, that's a difficult statement to make.  But
those movies were the early stages of making sex a comedic subject, and
American Pie is the next step in the evolutionary chain.  I'm sure I was as
shocked at some scenes as the previous generation were at segments of
Airplane! or Blazing Saddles.<br /><br />It's difficult to believe that this is the Weitz brothers first film.  The
story flowed extremely well, particularly over the raciest subject matter.
And the cast is superb.  Had the screenplay been handled with less finesse,
or the lines read with less youthful innocence, I'm certain this would have
been a movie to avoid.  But instead I found it a great escape.<br /><br />Eugene Levy was the only cast member I recognized from previous roles, and
he did a very credible job as the loving father awkwardly attempting to help
his boy pass into manhood.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend American Pie to any of my friends interested in
comedy films.&gt;
