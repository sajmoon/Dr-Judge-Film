Over here in the UK, we seems to have been bombarded by American teen
comedies, either on TV or in Film. We wouldn't mind, but none of them seem
to be that good. Of course we haven't actually made any ourselves, so
we're
hardly in a position to criticise, but the really sad thing is that the
teen-com concept is full of potential. Finally, someone was daring enough
to
explore the outrageousness of lusty adolescence. American Pie was
born!<br /><br />Make no mistake; the main strength of this film is it's sheer vulgarity.
The
usual patronising moral preaching that accompanies, and spoils, so many
films of this type is absent. Replacing it is a no holds barred look at
teenage angst, sexual curiosity, and the art of bodily function jokes. In
addition, the subject of masturbation has never been approached with such
an
unflinching eye!!<br /><br />The young cast, all relatively unknown, offer some impressive
performances.
The individual honours belong to Sean W Scott, who is repulsively likeable
as Stifler, even if it is nothing more than a role as the typically
moronic
American Jock. However, the most skillful moments of the film are provided
by Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy, who offer an excellent double act as the
son
with strange methods of experimentation and the father, whose methods of
sex
education are at times equally bizarre. The sense of awkwardness as they
endure their 'man to man' talks is remarkably convincing.<br /><br />The film isn't consistently funny, but the half dozen side splitting
moments
are more than enough to keep you amused, even if you have been told of
them
in vivid detail prior to watching. (Like I was)<br /><br />At times though, American Pie can certainly be accused of feeling a bit
familiar. After all, the guys trying to get laid routine has been done a
thousand times before, and some of the jokes (such as the old classic of
post laxative attack panic) are hardly original, but the film does include
some touches that save it from being totally predictable. For example
there
is the character of Finch, the mysterious member of the sex-obsessed
quartet
with sophisticated mannerisms, and the way the Jock element is played
through Lacrosse, rather than a more obvious or traditional American
sport.<br /><br />The purists will no doubt, make criticisms about it's over explicitness,
and
other such garbage about the corruption of the young, but as usual they
are
looking deeper than is necessary. While you could argue that American Pie
brings attention to the awkwardness, anxiousness and confusion of
adolescent
sexuality, it is really just an entertaining comedy, with grossness that
lifts it head and shoulders above the rest.
