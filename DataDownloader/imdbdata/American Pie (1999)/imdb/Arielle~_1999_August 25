1999_August 25 

This movie was excellent.I admit that I didn't even want to go see it at
first,but agreed because it was my husbands turn to choose the movie.I was
so happy that we went too!If you haven't seen the movie and don't want it
spoiled do not read any further.
It is your typical group of boys in high school (even though I never
knew
any seniors who were virgins!) who have made a pact to lose their
virginity
before graduation.One has a reluctant girlfriend who is saving herself for
the one who loves her,another has the worse pick up lines you have ever
heard,bachelor number three is a ball of nerves when it comes to women,and
number four is a very shy almost nerdy kind of guy.
Unlike some movies that have been out there,you tend to like these guys
even though they just want to get deflowered.It is a hysterical movie that
I
think everyone should see,young and old,as long as you are of mature age
because obviously it has many many references to sex and
such.
This movie,no doubt,will be a classic!
