American Pie has all the ingredients of a good movie.  First, the plot deals
with young people in search of their first sexual experience.  What could be
more basic to the human condition?  Second, although obviously fiction, the
film has a feeling of reality capturing the awkwardness and anxiety of young
people at this point in their lives.  Third, it is well written and not
always predictable as each young man employs his own strategy, and of
course, in the real world things do not always go as planned.  Fourth, the
cast consists of very talented young actors playing characters which may
remind the audience of people they may have known.  Fifth, the film has its
poignant moments. The final ingredient is this movie is hilarious.  The film
has one liners, sight gags, and situations that very funny.  The audience,
which ranged from teenagers to middle age, laughed almost constantly and out
loud.  CAUTION: This film is rated &quot;R&quot; for sexual situations and the use of
alcohol by young people.  If you are easily offended or sexual humor makes
you uncomfortable, stay away.  However, if you are not in the
aforementioned, you may enjoy it.  Three stars!!!
