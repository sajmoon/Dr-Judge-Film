This movie had myself and the rest of the theatre in stitches. The plot
surrounds four teenage boys and their attempts to get laid before
graduating
from high school. The humour is highly sexual in nature and at times
completely gross. You will either love this movie or hate it utterly. Yet
despite it's crude appearance it is actually very close to the mark in it's
depiction of high school teenagers.<br /><br />Alyson Hannigan's performance as the target of one of the lads affections
was probably the one that stood out from the others but I was too busy
laughing to notice too much. This is definitely a movie for a fun night out
but don't even think about watching it if you are expecting to see an
intelligent, thought provoking movie, or if non-stop sexual gags offend
you.
