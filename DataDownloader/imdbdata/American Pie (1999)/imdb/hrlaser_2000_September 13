This is one of those numerous films that, once you've seen the ad or
trailer, you pretty much know the whole story.  The purpose of a trailer is
get you psyched up to come back to see the film.  Well, in the case of
&quot;American Pie&quot;, most all the good parts ARE in the trailer.<br /><br />If you're expecting a non-stop hour and half of lusty busty high school
girls whipping off their clothes, forget it.  Except for a short topless
scene, you won't find that here. The ads promise a whole lot more than this
film delivers.<br /><br />High school seniors. Horny teenage boys craving Virginal teenage girls.
Prom Night. Rights of Passage and Bragging Rights.  That's about it.<br /><br />Except for Eugene Levy, there's barely a recognizable face in this entire
film.  Is that good?  Bad?  I don't know, but all leads, both male and
female, are mostly interchangable.  With their similar hairstyles and manner
of dress, it's often hard to tell which one you're looking at anyway.  At
least this film eschews the cliche' of the
High School Jock Bully and his Sadistic Henchmen [tm] and puts the guys
pretty much on par with each other, socially and sexually.<br /><br />Sad as it is to say, I found the most entertaining scene in this entire film
a &quot;forced him to drink laxative.. egads! Where's the toilet!&quot; bit, and it
was outdone tenfold by Jeff Daniels, in &quot;Dumb and Dumber.&quot;  If it's a
super-charged romp you're looking for, cast this one aside and rent or watch
&quot;Animal House&quot; instead.  Sure, those are college kids, but the idea's the
same, and the execution is superior in every way.<br /><br />
