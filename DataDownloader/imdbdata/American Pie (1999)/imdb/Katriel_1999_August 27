Well...that is my opinion.  But the truth is, I haven't seen one teen movie
that could match the joy and excitement that &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985)
could ever offer a movie viewer!<br /><br />I saw this movie last night, and while watching it in the beginning, I
thought it was going to be boring, because it started out very slow in the
beginning.  I was thinking in my mind, &quot;Please don't make me
disappointed!&quot;<br /><br />Plus, I thought that I would end up rating this movie a five instead, but as
the movie extended from the beginning to middle to end, I began to think
differently.  It was really hilarious, outrageous, and fun!  It brings a lot
of laughs and attracts attention to all movie lovers and of course,
teens.<br /><br />What I loved best about &quot;American Pie&quot; was that it had a mixture of romance
and comedy and friendship.  It shows the excitement of being young, happy,
and free especially when it is your senior year in high school. <br /><br />I truly did enjoy &quot;American Pie&quot;!  It's a light hearted, bubbly, fun, and
hilarious comedy that not only teens can enjoy, but also adults (just don't
take young children to see this movie...you'll see what I
mean)!<br /><br />This is my favorite teen movie of ALL TIME!!!!!!! - &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;
comes second...of course! :o)
