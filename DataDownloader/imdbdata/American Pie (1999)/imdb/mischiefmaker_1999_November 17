1999_November 17 

This is an honest film.  The opening scene shows exactly what it's all
about
and if you don't like it you can leave by the door you came in.  It's that
simple.  This film is about real teenagers.  For almost every charecter in
the film I could name of one my friends that could call that part their
lifestory.  This film is extremly funny but if you can't take crude humour
then it's not the film for you...sorry.  The soundtrack is also 100% and
the
guest appearance by Blink182 rounds the whole thing off perfectly (though
what that monkey was all about is anyones guess).  Watch this with a load
of
friends!
