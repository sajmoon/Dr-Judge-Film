O.k. my summary sounds pretty far-fetched but how many other teen
movies have come out that have &quot;defined a generation&quot;, launched the
career of one of the biggest selling modern rock bands (blink 182),
been voted the seventh funniest movie of all time and managed to strike
a balance between hilarious and sincere? The answer is not many.<br /><br />American Pie really is one of the best teen movies out there. It has
tons of laughs- e.g. the webcam- and features the definitive
embarrassing dad- Eugene Levy who, in this movie, is one of the
funniest people I have ever seen.<br /><br />Part of the reason it works is that it centres around four central
characters, all of which have extremely entertaining stories. Also
there&#39;s Stifler. Nowadays seann william Scott is pretty well known and
the pie movies really helped launch him. Some say Stifler is one
dimensional, but who cares, he&#39;s hilarious.<br /><br />Part cringe, part laugh, part empathy overall it really works. OK it&#39;s
not really a 10 star film, but come one guys, it deserves a higher user
rating than 6.8!
