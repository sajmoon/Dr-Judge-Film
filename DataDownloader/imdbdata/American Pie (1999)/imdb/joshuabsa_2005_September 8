American Pie is an amazing picture in its way, its one of the funniest
films ever shot. Its one of the only films that I have actually had to
hit pause so I could catch my breath a breath properly again. The
performances are actually quite good, something very rare in teen
comedies. The direction is very good also each scene and character has
its own feel, and is directed perfectly to the feeling. The story is
raunchy and crude, but at the end also very good hearted. The
screenplay is one of the strongest points, the dialogue sizzles, some
of the most realistic I have ever heard. The look at a teenage life is
also extereemly realistic, me being a teenager know this more than all
the adults that called this crude, unfunny, and unrealistic. This is
very R. rated, but so is the life of a teenager, sometimes even more
than this film. I loved this film, and unless your even slightly closed
minded you will to. <br /><br />If you enjoyed American Pie, you might also like National Lampoons
Animal House.
