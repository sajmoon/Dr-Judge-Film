2000_January 5 

Rented the &quot;unrated&quot; version, the one, they say, &quot;I was not allowed to see
in theatres&quot;.  Missed it in theatres.  Watched the &quot;not rated&quot; version. 
What's the big deal.  What is it about this version that makes it unworthy
of an &quot;R&quot; rating?  I have read others' comments here on I.M.D.B. and still
cannot figure it out.  The film had its funny moments, as well as its
&quot;groaning&quot; moments.  All-in-all a good, not great, film.  A funny, not
hilarious, film.  A wonderful not-to-be-missed film for horny teenage boys
and twentysomething men.  A see-it-if-you-can film for everybody else.  Once
again, the &quot;unrated&quot; version, being advertised as the equivalent of an NC-17
version, isn't.  Not by a longshot.
