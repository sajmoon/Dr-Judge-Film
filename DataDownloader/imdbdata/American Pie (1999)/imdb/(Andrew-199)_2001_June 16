Delightful, groundbreaking and refreshing - and not adapted from a book?!
I
even think there may have been a moral tucked away in there somewhere.
Perhaps not for the older generations [those over seventy at any rate] and
not a film to watch comfortably around the parents. It's crude and
distasteful - perhaps that's why I like it so much?<br /><br />I look forward to American Pie 2 most certainly
