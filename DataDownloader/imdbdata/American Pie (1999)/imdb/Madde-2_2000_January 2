2000_January 2 

I am not about to tell you about how obscene or offensive this movie is -
and no doubt it is both of those - because I know that you've heard enough
about that.  I am also not going to lecture the film industry either on
gradually shifting the limits of comedy to the point where story is no
longer a critical aspect provided that you can put the characters into as
many embarrassing and disgusting scenes as possible or on how despite the
films rating which supposedly restricts admittance to those 17 and over
(yeah, right), it is a perfect example of Hollywood's marketing to an
audience for whom it maybe shouldn't be.<br /><br />American Pie is a textbook case of all of the above points.  It's plot,
high
school seniors vow to lose their virginity by graduation, sinks beyond
unoriginal and enters blatant cliche territory.  But, the fact that you get
to see one of the characters masturbate with baked goods makes up for it in
the laugh department.<br /><br />That said, American Pie was NOT a bad movie and for that matter I DID like
it...sort of.  It's characters were certainly likeable enough and somewhat
sympathetic.  And indeed, I caught myself laughing at things that I
probably
wouldn't want to admit to.<br /><br />However, like so many teen sex comedies before it (however much more
explicit this one is in relative comparison) it is stale and  predictable.<br /><br />A few redeeming performances, notably Chris Klein who, although, seems to
be
playing the exact same character as he did in Election, comes off honest
and
refreshing.  Even more notably, Eugene Levy, who more or less using his
comic genius managed to add hilarity to an otherwise dreary
work.
