Every once and awhile a movie comes along that everybody loves except
me.
Everybody is saying that American pie is a little crude but still good.
Who
are they kidding, the movie is a piece of crap. Even Leonard Maltin gave
this movie three stars, which was more than he gave Forrest Gump!<br /><br />The movie has absolutely no plot. It makes me (a teenager) think to my
self
what is the world coming to when everybody thinks its funny to see sicko
teenagers play with themselves!
