American Pie is the funniest movie that I have seen in about five years.
Something About Mary had me laughing, Big Daddy had me holding my sides,
and
South Park had me shocked but humoured.  American Pie is heads and
shoulders
above any of these films.  What makes this film so funny is not only its
attempt to humour us, but its honesty in every scene.  And that honesty can
bring us back to what it was like to be there.  So whether you lost it ten
years ago, yesterday of even five minutes ago, you can relate to the
feelings that this movie has.<br /><br />It is three weeks before the prom and four friends have made a pact to get
laid before the end of prom.  The four friends consist of a guy who has
been
dating a girl for quite a while but hasn't gotten past third base.  Another
is a shy guy that has problems doing his &quot; business &quot; at school because of
cleanliness issues.  A third is portrayed at first as the quintessential
jock that just wants to use his athletic prowess to meet the ladies.  And
finally we have Jim.  Jim is the guy that you see in the commercials.  He
is
so sexually inept that when he tries to talk to a girl, he shies away
before
any words will leave his mouth.  And when he has a naked girl in his room,
he &quot; blows it &quot; twice, before he can get the prize.<br /><br />The most interesting situation was how the jock &quot; OZ &quot; grew in this movie.
He started off as a typical jock.  Then he meets a girl that he really
likes.  And suddenly he doesn't just want to have sex, he really cares
about
her and at the end when we see them together, it makes you feel warm.  It
is
their relationship that makes you remember what it was like to really like
someone for the first time.<br /><br />There are many other delicate and poignant scenes in the film concerning
love.  Kevin and Vickey's relationship is a tricky one because they both
really like each other but she is not sure if she wants to take that last
step.  This causes some friction in the relationship, but when it is
resolved, it is written so convincingly that you are happy for
them.<br /><br />This film combines some true intelligence and romance with a wickedly funny
look at the complexities of sex.  And nothing is sacred here.  They explore
female and male oral sex.  They talk in depth about orgasms and of course
masturbation is a big topic in this film.  And that makes it side
splittingly funny and incredibly witty.  American Pie really is a miracle.
It was written by Adam Herz and this is his first film.  And judging by his
ear for dialogue and character, he will be around for quite some time.<br /><br />The one performance that I wanted to call attention to was Chris Klein as
Oz.  I wasn't sure where I had seen him before so I looked him up in the
IMDb.  And he was in Election.  And he was great in that film too.  But
here
he is honest and sincere in his performance and he lends credence to his
character.  He is very good in American Pie and I believe he will go on to
do bigger things in Hollywood.<br /><br />So if what you are looking for is one hilarious film and you like Something
About Mary (tripled) kind of humour, then this is your movie.  If you don't
like that kind of film, don't even bother to see this film.  But you are
missing a true treasure.  Thsi film reminds me a bit of a combination
between The Breakfast Club and Fast Times.  So check it out.  You will
laugh
and you will cheer when you walk out of theater.  The only bad thing about
this film is that it ended.<br /><br />One final thought is that you should really beware of the chicks in band
that play the flute.  ( Wickedly funny!! )<br /><br />Wonderful movie!
