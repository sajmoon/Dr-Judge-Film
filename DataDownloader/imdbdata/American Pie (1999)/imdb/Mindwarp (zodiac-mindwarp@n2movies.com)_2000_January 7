American Pie is a pretty good coming of age teen sex comedy, but despite the
fact that there was plenty of tasteless humor, it was still a very
predictable done-before, and Done better, kind of movie.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that even with all of the masturbation and sex jokes
that the movie got a &quot;18 years old&quot; requirement for it's unrated video
release.  <br /><br />After four High school guys get together and make a pact to help each other
to lose their virginity, we get to watch and have a fair amount of laughs at
their ongoing attempts, which of course culminate at Prom
Night.<br /><br />Pretty fun, with decent performances by the young cast, although it is
Shannon Elizabeth really stands out as a very sexy young
performer.
