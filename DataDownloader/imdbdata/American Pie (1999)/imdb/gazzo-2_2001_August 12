Not bad as far's these things go-the 'morals' at the end basically being
'wait for the right gal/guy' and 'don't do it just to do it', etc. Yer
typical Hollywood Highschool jammed with Tara Reid type 24 year old models
masquerading as 17 year old students; hardly a black person, hispanic or
regular type kid/person in sight.<br /><br />You have seen everything in here before if you sat through Porky's or Fast
Times or whatever else in that genre back in the 80's. It's harmless, if I
were 15 it would have been quite a show; but at 35, been there and done
dat.<br /><br />** for some yuks and yucks.
