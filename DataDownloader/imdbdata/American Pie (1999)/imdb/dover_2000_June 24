Let me start off by saying: Just where is this high school? Seemingly
everyone in the film in attractive, and no one actually looks like they're
in high school. The school is clean and well-kept. Also, among the hundred
or so students we see, a while two of them are minorities.<br /><br />This is a wierd film, when you think about it: a strange mix of There's
Something about Mary, Animal House, and Stand by Me that just doesn't sit
right, somehow. The whole story (if you can call it that) is pathetically
obvious. If they let everything be about sex, that's one thing - but there's
some abstract issues here the film wants to play in but doesn't really try
to understand. Lip service is paid to &quot;love&quot;, but everything makes more
sense when the characters just want to get laid.<br /><br />The movie isn't all bad - there's some funny scenes as the main character
(Jason Biggs) and his dad (former CTV star Eugene Levy) try to broach the
subject of sex in a fatherly manner, but  there isn't much
else.
