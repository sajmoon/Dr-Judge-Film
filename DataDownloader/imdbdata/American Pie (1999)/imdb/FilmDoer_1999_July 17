1999_July 17 

TSA Mary was funnier.  This was Porky's, Weird Science, the Graduate, and
Fast Times at Ridgemont High, all rolled into one.
I guess it's been a week since this movie's been opened in Silicon Valley,
and this movie was actually sold out at the showing I watched.  The laughs
were very few for a packed house.  Comments from the person I was with?
She
told me that the movie was just &quot;alright for a matinee.&quot;  Thank God I only
paid for this movie at half the price.
