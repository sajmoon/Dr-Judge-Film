1999_July 31 
...of CR*P! I can't believe that this movie was even picked up by the
studios, much less that it's making so much money! The actors, with the sole
exceptions of Finch and the curly-haired girl (there are reasons these
people are no-names), are all horrible! Absolutely atrocious! If they have
good delivery, then I should make another movie full of these nim-skulls and
half-wits. I might make a good deal of money!
This movie truly appeals to those who remember high school as a hormone
imbalance ground-zero. I can't wait to see Eyes Wide Shut to purge myself of
this inane garbage that people are calling sexual truth. Give me a
break!
And the writing! I've heard better on Marc Singer movies! The editing
couldn't be choppier! I can't believe this film is so popular! People have
no souls! Go watch Jason Lee in *any* of his movies - THAT is delivery! THAT
is funny. I laughed twice because of the movie. I laughed twenty times with
my friends at the writing and at the unbelievable quality of this movie!
Save your money! I've heard Blair Witch is good. Go see it. Stay away from
this gonzo piece of sh*t.
