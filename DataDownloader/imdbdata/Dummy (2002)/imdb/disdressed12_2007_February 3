&quot;Dummy&quot; is basically the story of a shy man who takes up ventriloquism
and gains confidence in life.his friend is an unestablished singer in a
band who dreams of making it big.Steven(Brody) still lives at home with
his parents and his sister Heid.i(Illeana Douglas)to say his family is
dysfunctional is an understatement.Milla Jovovvich plays Fangora
Steven&#39;s friend and aspiring singer.she lives with her mother,who is a
total b**ch and seems to think the only reason Fangora is around is to
run errands for her.Vera Farmiga plays Lorena,who works in the
employment office where Steven Shows up one day after being fired from
his job.Farmiga puts in another great performance.She has built a
career out of small,sometimes supporting character roles.regardless,she
is possibly the most underrated actress out there.as for Jovovich,she
is barely recognizable in a very unglamorous,tomboy kind of role,but
she pulls it off convincingly.overall this movie is a real gem and
should not be missed.if you haven&#39;t seen it,you should do so. a very
strong 8/10
