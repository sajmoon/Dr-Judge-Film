It&#39;s painfully obvious that this is an indie movie. Not in a
Juno/Garden State &quot;I&#39;m going to quirk you to death&quot; kinda of way, but
in that the story is not polished at all, there are a lot of loose ends
that could have benefited from an extra scene or two, feels made for TV
and is just plain blah. The idea was pretty neat, but there was
absolutely no setup, and the only exposition to him wanting to get a
dummy was him watching the movie at the very beginning.<br /><br />All that said, it had plenty of cute and enjoyable moments. The whole
romantic aspect was good, and I liked Mila Jovavich&#39;s character, who
was perfectly annoying. And I found Adrien Brody&#39;s character, and by
extension the dummy, pretty interesting.
