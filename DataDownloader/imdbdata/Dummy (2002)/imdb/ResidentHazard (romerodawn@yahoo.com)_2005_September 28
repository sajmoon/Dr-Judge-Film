Adrien Brody and Milla Jovovich star in this film about a group of
people that are, for lack of a better term, a bunch of losers. Adrian
Brody is an awkward person who chooses the ultimate career of the
loser. One of a ventriloquist&#151;complete with frightful dummy and a
personality which can generally only be seen only when he speaks
through said dummy. Milla Jovovich is a singer in a punk band that
excels at maintaining constant failure. Each of our &quot;heroes&quot; still live
with their respective parents&#151;and their 10-year High School Reunion is
around the bend (not part of the story except to give us the idea that,
holy hell, these people are way too old to still be living at home!).
Adrien's sister is a failed wedding planner who's latest wedding is for
a Jewish family, a culture which she largely knows nothing about.
Adrien Brody becomes attracted to the woman at the employment agency
trying to help him find work, er, as a ventriloquist. He initially
scares the hell out of her, but he of course, gradually convinces her
of his worth, but only by speaking through his dummy, which for a large
portion of the film, is the only way he can accurately or easily convey
his thoughts to others. The film follows three distinct stories, Adrien
Brody's, Milla Jovovich's, and Illeana Douglas' characters (Brody's
sister)&#151;all of which come together rather nicely.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />--The acting is great and the characters are fascinating&#151;each with
their own level of depth, quirks, and loads of problems.<br /><br />--The movie looks and feels like an independent film, which I
personally liked.<br /><br />--Great drama, great humor--but it's a quirky and weird humor.<br /><br />--A lot of character development and growth.<br /><br />Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br /><br />--Pretty much all the characters are losers or failures of some sort,
so they're not easily likable. But the very human quality of the
characters allows them to really grow on you.<br /><br />--Adrien Brody's dummy is smarter and a smoother talker than he is, but
then again, that's a character trait&#133;<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />--I suppose, if you hate watching people speak through dummies, you'll
have a real problem with this. Otherwise, there is little wrong with
this picture.<br /><br />--It's got kind of a &quot;weird&quot; vibe about it throughout, it's not
painfully strong, but it hovers around there--the weirdness--which may
be off-putting for some people.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />--Adrien Brody's father assembles model warships&#133; while watching porn.<br /><br />Memorable Scene:<br /><br />--Adrien Brody's thank you &quot;letter&quot; to his employment
case-worker--classy.<br /><br />Acting: 8/10 Story: 8/10 Atmosphere: 7/10 Cinematography: 7/10
Character Development: 10/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 0/10 (there was
none) Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 Violence/Gore: 1/10 (really wasn't any)
Music: 8/10 Direction: 8/10<br /><br />Cheesiness: 3/10 Crappiness: 0/10<br /><br />Overall: 8/10<br /><br />A nice &quot;dramedy&quot; that makes you feel good when it ends. Good for anyone
except people that hate that kind of stuff&#133; Or those who fear
ventriloquist dummies&#151;you know who you are, you weirdoes. <br /><br />( www.ResidentHazard.com ) ( http://bartboard.proboards3.com/index.cgi
