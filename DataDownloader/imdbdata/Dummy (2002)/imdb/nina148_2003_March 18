I saw this movie at the South by Southwest film festival and absolutely
loved it.  The writing was great:  witty, off-beat, and able to skillfully
balance poignant moments with episodes that were purely hilarious,
sometimes
within the space of a few moments.  The direction and cinematography were
excellent...it was the best-looking movie at the festival, including some
of
the bigger studio releases.  The acting was pitch-perfect...I guess by now
everyone knows what a good dramatic actor Adrian Brody is due to his Oscar
nomination, but his comedic talents were a surprise.  Even more surprising
was Milla Jovovich's incredibly funny portrayal of the main character's
sincere but temperamentally explosive New Jerseyite buddy.  The director
gave all of these actors -- including Vera Farmiga (who I hadn't seen
before) and the fabulous supporting actors who play Steven's family -- the
space to do their stuff, and the results were impressive.  I'm not usually
this effusive about a film, but I thought this one was better than many of
the Oscar-nominated films this year, and it'll be a crime if it doesn't
get
good distribution.  If a film like &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot; can do so
well
on the independent *and* wide-release circuit, one like this with better
writing, acting, direction and about ten times as many laughs should do
even
better.
