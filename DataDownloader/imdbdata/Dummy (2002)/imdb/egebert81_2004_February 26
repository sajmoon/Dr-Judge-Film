I wish there were more films like &quot;Dummy&quot;...I find it amazing that this
movie wasn't released on a wide scale....I know it can be considered an
indie film...but this should of been a much bigger movie...I find it
amazing
that Adrien Brody learned to be a ventriloquist for this film..he's a very
dedicated actor....he was also great in The Pianist...but in this movie
proved he can do different things....I am definitely looking forward to
more
movies with Adrien Brody...It's good to
see
&quot;big&quot; actors like Adrien do smaller, indie movies like
&quot;Dummy&quot;.
