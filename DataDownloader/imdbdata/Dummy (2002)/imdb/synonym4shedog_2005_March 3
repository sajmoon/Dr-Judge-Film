2005_March 3 
Not sure what I expected out of this movie, but I certainly didn't
expect to bounce around in my chair the entire time, cackling with
delight. For a fairly linear plot, there are enough twists and turns to
satisfy anyone, and the performances are uniformly strong. Milla
Jovovich's &quot;Fangora&quot; was astonishing. I was struck more than once by
what the contrast between her constant motion and Brody's physical
stillness said about their characters' attitude toward life. The
smaller parts, although somewhat more broadly stereotypical, were so
different that after one viewing a person easily remembers all the
characters. And any female who has ever had a &quot;Michael&quot; in her life
will appreciate how lovingly (and creepily) his portrayal has been
accomplished. In fact, I think those are the watchwords for this flick:
loving, delightful, and just the teeniest bit creepy.
