2009_September 2 
Inspired by an old film, a young man seeks to overcome his shyness
through ventriloquism. This is an odd little indie flick, but its
optimism, charm and sweet nature, kept in check by some relatively dark
comedy, makes it a pleasant watch. The plot isn&#x27;t bad, though this
really focuses more on the character development than the story, of
which there really only is just barely enough for the 90 minutes of
running time. Humor is fine, though if you don&#x27;t know anything about
Jewish family relationships(thus, if you are determined to check this
out, make sure to take a course lasting at least a couple of episodes
of the sit-com &#x22;The Nanny&#x22;), you won&#x27;t get about a third of the
material. Not all of the jokes and gags are funny, and there are at
least a few bits where this comes off as trying much too hard to get
laughs, and is unsuccessful. Then again, it&#x27;s never downright
embarrassing. The acting is great, Brody does marvelous as always, and
Jovovich shines as the utterly manic punk-rock friend. Cinematography
and editing are average, with at least an instance or two where the
camera didn&#x27;t move when it seemed like it ought to. There is a lot of
truth in this, and in spite of this not being entirely devoid of sap(if
quite close), it almost invariably makes its points without an
unhealthy dose of saccharine. While the strong language and the
occasional, usually mild sexual reference make this an R, this is
mostly inoffensive. I recommend this to those who like dramas about
having the courage to go for what you want, and romance movies. 7/10
