Greg Pritikins film is a delight from start to finish. Whilst obviously
shot
on a limited budget, Pritikin brings such warmth &amp; love to his movie, that
from the first few notes of the soundtrack you just know you are in for a
treat.<br /><br />Adrien Brody is charming, whilst Milla Jovovich is a revelation - her
performance is a testament to both her ability as an actress &amp; Pritikin's
flair as a director.<br /><br />A wonderful, jewel of a movie.
