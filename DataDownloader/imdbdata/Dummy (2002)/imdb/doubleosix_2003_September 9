&quot;Dummy&quot; is that rare indie... not only is it touching, sweet, and smart
(sure, that covers lots of indies) it's actually laugh-out-loud funny. And
Adrien Brody's performance is remarkable if only for the fact that he
became
a genuine ventriloquist for the role! As good as he is, though, it's
Jovovich who is transcendent, delivering a performance the likes of which
we've never seen from her.
