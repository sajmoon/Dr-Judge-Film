2004_March 5 

I have always foung the art of ventriloquism quite fascinating. There is an
odd sort of extension of your personality that can only come out in another
avenue. For Steven(a really nerdy,quite distant but sweet performance from
Adrien Brody)this dummy he buys becomes his comfort pal. Words that come
from Steven..yet not from &quot;his mouth&quot;..through the dummy show a funny,often
charming, side to him. He meets a woman named Lorena(Vera Farmiga..a
beautiful and talented actress I've never seen before)who is his
unemployment worker(the person who tries to find you a job). He gets a crush
on her,but it's only through the wild and crazy rocker,Fangora(Milla
Javovich..who tries too hard and is a little hyperactive and at times
unconvincing),that he can get courage to ask her out. His sister,Heidi(the
always great Illeana Douglas),is a wedding planner who wants had dreams to
sing. She calls Steven a loser and pokes fun at his new friend(she feels
rather creeped out about our wooden hero). The film has truly sweet moments
and I laughed all through primarily at the scenes between Brody and the
dummy. The film has a comic tone,but is an adult film. It has quite a bit of
profanity(mostly from Fangora),but is also at times quite intriguing and
warm. It's an uneven film with odd pacing,but an overall satisfying
comedy.
