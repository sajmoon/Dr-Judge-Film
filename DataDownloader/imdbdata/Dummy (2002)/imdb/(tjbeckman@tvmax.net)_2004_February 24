Once again people &quot;You can make a bad movie from a good script but it's
impossible to make a good movie from a bad script.&quot; Ten minutes in I knew
this was another writer/director movie before I ever checked the credits.
They stand out like sore thumbs. The vision exists solely in one mind
which
means if it's unclear, nobody knows until it's in the can.<br /><br />The characters were quirky for quirkys' sake as is the trend in Hollywood.
I
couldn't suspend my disbelief; you need depth in order to tread water.
It's
all in the writing. I'm no fan of windy exposition but in this case I
think
it was needed. Jovovich' scenes were monologues and horrendously
over-acted;
they didn't propel the movie anywhere. They were inserted so we could
observe &quot;Isn't she quirky?&quot;<br /><br />It was quite simply another script raced to production without the time
spent asking &quot;Does this scene tell the audience enough/too much?&quot; &quot;Does
this
scene have a beginning, middle and an end?&quot; &quot;Is McDonald's
hiring?&quot;<br /><br />I always learn more from clunkers than from hits and lucky for me
Blockbuster is &quot;all full up&quot; as we say 'round these parts.<br /><br />
