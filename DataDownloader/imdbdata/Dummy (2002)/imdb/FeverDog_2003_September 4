DUMMY is nothing more or less than a genial portrait of a sad-sack
loser and his overbearing family. Good thing the characters are
individual enough to invest interest in. I really liked everybody in
this movie, and wanted to know more about them. Unfortunately, not all
of them were developed to my satisfaction. For example, I would have
liked to know more about Milla&#39;s foul-mouthed rock star wannabe
Fangora, and Lorena, the single-mother love interest. Who are they? How
did they get to where they are? Sketchy background details in the
script didn&#39;t fill out these characters enough.<br /><br />But what am I saying? DUMMY is impossible to hate, and has got a lot to
recommend in it. For instance, I love when movies show an artist honing
his craft. I&#39;m tired of seeing the usual cop/doctor/lawyer/superhero
slate of Hollywood protagonists, and, I was watching Brody&#39;s
interpretation of a struggling artist intently. (His character is very
reminiscent of John Cusack&#39;s in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.) Brody yet again
does not disappoint. I&#39;ve been following his career since SUMMER OF SAM
(for those who didn&#39;t already know), and he here validates his Oscar
win for the movie he made right after this. Watching his novice
ventriloquist interact with himself through his never-named dummy was
fascinating, and a lesson in acting.<br /><br />There are also many funny moments in DUMMY. I can&#39;t repeat them since
they grow out of the characters&#39; personalities and specific situations
they find themselves in. This isn&#39;t a collection of one-liners that
beget fanboy quotes, but the movie is humorous from beginning to end.<br /><br />Another thing about Milla. I&#39;m predisposed to like her in any movie (I
cannot dislike any actor from DAZED AND CONFUSED - no, not even Fleck),
but I had to work at liking her here. Maybe it&#39;s due to her
aforementioned underdeveloped role, but her Fanny &quot;Fangora&quot; was rather
abrasive. Is it Milla&#39;s fault, or the script&#39;s? I&#39;m leaning toward the
latter.<br /><br />Illeana Douglas, as Brody&#39;s wedding-planner sister, was, as always, a
delight. Why isn&#39;t she a huge star? She&#39;s been around for years, going
all the way back to her minor role in GOODFELLAS (she first caught my
eye in ALIVE). Her lovely, large doe eyes, to-die-for cheekbones, and
effortless ability to command the screen make me wonder if she&#39;s
content to be merely a working actress. I could look at that gorgeous
face all day. She steals so many scenes in DUMMY that there should be a
warrant out for her arrest. Simply fabulous.<br /><br />I did, however, strongly dislike the music. Think uninspired rehashes
of never-recorded Gin Blossoms knockoffs, and you&#39;ll get an idea of the
bland guitar-pop used here. This is one soundtrack I will not be
buying.<br /><br />The producer and writer/director of DUMMY introduced the film
beforehand and held a Q&amp;A session after. The usual questions were asked
(&quot;Was Brody a ventriloquist before shooting?&quot; &quot;No...&quot;), but w/d Greg
Pritikin did implore the crowd to talk up his movie, since it&#39;s
apparently opening against 11 other movies here in New York. So, I did
my part here. DUMMY is nothing special, but a pleasant, decent indie
movie with a lot of good humor and positive values. What else can I
say? What kind of jerk would I be to trash a movie shot, according to
Pritikin, in three weeks in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Wayne, New
Jersey? I haven&#39;t forgotten my roots. Go Jersey!<br /><br />7/10
