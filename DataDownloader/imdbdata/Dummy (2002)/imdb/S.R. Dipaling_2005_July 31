Adrien Brody's next movie,after his Oscar-winning turn in &quot;The Pianist&quot;
is this film which is beautifully odd and full of quirk and sweetness.
Brody is Steven, a lonely,shy working mensch who lives at home and
senses his life slipping away from him. One night,he discovers the art
of ventriloquy is the venting of his trapped spirit. Spurred along by
his friend,a Gothic,wild-child girl rocker named Fanny(Milla
Jovovich,kinetic here),Steven pursues his dream,much to the utter
amazement of his painfully neurotic family(Jessica Walter,Ron Leibmann
and Ileana Douglas). Meanwhile,he harbors a crush on an employment
counselor(Vera Farmigia),a sweet woman with a difficult past.<br /><br />Meanwhile,the dummy Steven has worked with has nearly developed a
personality of its own,goading Steven to become bolder and braver
mensch. <br /><br />Brody's acuity at ventriloquy further enhances this film,which has
nothing particularly fancy or breathtaking to it. The love story at
play here is...well,it's different. It's neither sentimental nor
cynical,sweet but not syrupy. Kind of rare in the world of light
romantic comedy.<br /><br />The show is spare but that,I feel,enhances this pic. To me,this is one
of the more unique films I've sen in quite a while. Kudos to
director/writer Greg Pritkin for his deft touch. The cast is well
placed and make this film both awkward and warm. I recommend this film
for anyone who likes either/or both their comedies or romances odd and
true.
