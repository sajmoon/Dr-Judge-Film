2004_May 6 

I was initially attracted to this film by its cover, not having ever heard
of it before seeing at my local library. I have enjoyed Adrian Brody's
previous films and Milla Jovovich is absolutely gorgeous. The concept of a
grown adult trying to become a ventriloquist was so novel that it had to
be
interesting. It is one of those professions you are aware exists but don't
really think anyone does it anymore. Before I go on, I must say a little
about the soundtrack. This movie could not have been what it is without
Mike
Ruekberg's beautiful yet simple melodies and poetic lyrics.<br /><br />Setting a synopsis aside, this movie really spoke to me as a true-to-life
story of people who realize, possibly a little late in life, that dreams
are
worth pursuing. All three main characters step outside themselves in order
to pursue what they have always wanted. It was also interesting that all
of
them in one form or another broke free of their parent's influence or lack
of support.<br /><br />I know this is only a movie, full of bad editing and inexpensive sets, but
this indie film is one truly worth treasuring and taking to
heart.
