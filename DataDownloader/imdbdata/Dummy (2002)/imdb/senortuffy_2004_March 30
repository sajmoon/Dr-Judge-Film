This is a surprisingly funny movie about a thirty-year-old man who lives at
home with his parents.  Adrien Brody plays Steven, a socially awkward young
man who gets fired from his office clerical job one day and decides to
become a ventriloquist.  Brody is quite good in the role and displays
comedic talent I didn't know he had.<br /><br />Steven's family are a bunch of losers too.  His father's retired and sits
around all day putting model ships together.  His typically Jewish mother
smothers him with attention while destroying his sense of worth.  His
sister, played by Illeana Douglas, is a wedding planner who's own engagement
goes sour when her fiance turns psycho.  Steven's only friend (Milla
Jovovich) is an outcast like himself, a puck rock singer who also lives at
home.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot or anything, but there are some really
funny scenes in the film.  The wedding at the end, where Jovovich turns into
a Yiddish punk rock singer was one of them.  The film's not only a good
comedy but there's a touching romantic thread running through it between
Brody's character and his unemployment counselor, played by Vera Farmiga
(she plays the Jocelyn Jordan character in the remake of &quot;The Manchurian
Candidate).<br /><br />All in all an excellent little film and one I highly recommend.  From
reading the review of writer/director Greg Pritikin's next film coming out
soon, I think we have a new talent to follow.
