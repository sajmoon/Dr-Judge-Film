Steven (Adrien Brody), nearly 30 and living with his parents, sees an
old Edgar Bergen movie on TV and decides to fulfill his longtime dream
of becoming a ventriloquist. His beautiful unemployment counselor
Lorena (Vera Farmiga) finds him work, but puts out a restraining order
on him when he paints a thank-you note on her door. Later, this young
mother agrees to date him anyway, but finds his bickering family, and
his inexperience with women, daunting to a relationship. Steven&#x27;s
sister Heidi (Illeana Douglas) is a wedding planner with a drunken
ex-fianc&#xE9; who keeps showing up at the door. His friend Fangora (Milla
Jovavich) is a pseudo-punk rocker whose sex does not prevent her from
giving him terrible advice about women. The wedding of a Jewish girl,
who wants Klezmer music and gets something unexpected, will become a
turning point in everyone&#x27;s lives.<br /><br />Whoa, this is bad. Greg Pritikin directs his own script, about a tenth
of which is funny. The rest strains hard to give us quirky characters,
wacky situations and unexpected plot twists; but we can&#x27;t buy any of
it. The movie becomes unrecoverable when Lorena changes her mind about
the restraining order and agrees to date Steven&#x97;after he mails her a
videotaped apology featuring himself and his dummy. The message on her
door disturbed her, but the tape charmed her? I could almost hear Vera
Farmiga&#x27;s brain going &#x22;ZZZZZT!&#x22; as she tried to play this character.
Their relationship grows into the least believable
nerd-with-beautiful-girl scenario I&#x27;ve ever seen.<br /><br />The performances are varied. Adrien Brody recovers fairly well from
playing such a pointless character. Farmiga is charming, especially
considering the impossibility of her job. Jovavich, with her affected
Jersey accent, never quite seems to inhabit her character. Illeana
Douglas, a good actress, does a lousy job here. She doesn&#x27;t seem to get
what she&#x27;s doing, and we can hardly blame her.<br /><br />This is part of a sub-genre in comedy that I dislike: one that blurs
the distinction between celebrating and belittling the losers it
depicts. &#x22;Napoleon Dynamite,&#x22; &#x22;Waiting for Guffman&#x22; and documentaries
like &#x22;American Movie&#x22; and &#x22;Gates of Heaven&#x22; all belong in this dubious
category. But &#x22;Dummy&#x22; is much worse. It&#x27;s as phony as it is
condescending.
