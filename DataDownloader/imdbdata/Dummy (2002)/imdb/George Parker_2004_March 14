The premise of &quot;Dummy&quot; had enormous potential as a romantic comedy which was
unrealized in execution. It goes something like this: Introverted, nerdy,
socially inept ventriloquist meets beautiful women who falls in love with
him through the persona of his dummy which exudes humor and charm of which
the man alone is not capable vis-a-vis (A sort of Cyrano de Bergerac theme).
Unfortunately this threadbare indie gloms the screenplay up with so many
kookie characters the romcom thread is all but buried. Nonetheless, &quot;Dummy&quot;
is passable fodder worth a look for Brody fans, anyone lusting for beautiful
rising star Farmiga, or those who still can enjoy ventriloquism. Should have
ended with the kiss. Best line in the film: &quot;I look both ways when I cross
the street&quot;.  (B-)
