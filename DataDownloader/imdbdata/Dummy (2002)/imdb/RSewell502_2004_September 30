I really liked the quirky humour and though Adrien Brody's acting was
astonishing, the ensemble playing and the interplay of dummy and people
was what made the film work for me. I am an ignorant English Quaker and
I had a simple question for the director or Adrien or any other
American viewers. Is Adrien's character meant to represent a
specifically Jewish character, or is the film, as I suspect, more
universal in its design?<br /><br />I teach 11-16 year olds and have written books on mainstreaming
children with special needs. I may have read the movie all wrong, but
to me the humour brought alive all the hassle that children with
Asperger's Syndrome have, trying to communicate their ideas and
feelings to an uncomprehending world. My old school has one of the best
records in UK for bringing children on the autistic spectrum out of
special schools into ordinary classrooms and get great results for
them. It takes real love for the staff to help the other children treat
them with the kind of respect they need to show their proper talents.
The anguish in Adrien's eyes was met with perfect friendship and love
in his sister and girl friends and I thought that it was this that
helped him reveal his true talents. <br /><br />I have never filled in a comments box like this before and I only do so
because Dummy is one of my all time favourite movies<br /><br />Respect
