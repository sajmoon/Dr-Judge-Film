Adrien Brody and Milla Jovovich star in this cutesy romantic comedy
about your typical misunderstood but nice loser who's unlucky in love
and life who decides one day to quit his job and become a
ventriloquist. Things are slow going so he needs to find a job but he
ends up falling for his unemployment case worker. Things start off a
bit badly thanks to his best bud (Jovovich) but warm up as everything
falls around them.<br /><br />&quot;Dummy&quot; isn't original by any means but the cast is excellent and
likable and Brody and the 'Dummy&quot; are quite funny. It wraps up in usual
fashion with everyone getting what they need in the end.<br /><br />Pretty conventional but entertaining.<br /><br />S10 rating: 3/5 or 7/10
