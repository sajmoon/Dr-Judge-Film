Great idea, good acting, pathetic script. So ridiculously absurd that
you&#39;d have to be from another planet to think that this could ever
happen. And it really is a very basic story- nothing really happens-
but the chemistry between the characters is so lacking that you can&#39;t
believe that there would ever be any genuine attraction between the two
main characters. Even in other movies where the boring loser guy gets
the hot chick, he at least has something to offer her. This movie was a
complete waste of time, despite wonderful performances by most of the
main characters. Illeana Douglas (Ghost World, Cape Fear, New York
Stories) and Vera Farmiga (just an all around up and coming good
looking film actress)were both exceptional.
