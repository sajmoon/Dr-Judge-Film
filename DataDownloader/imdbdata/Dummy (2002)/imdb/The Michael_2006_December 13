For a movie that is about a man with a ventriloquist dummy, it is very
heartfelt and well made. the Michael finds this movie to be very
hilarious, enjoyable, and original. Adrien Brody and (my all time
favorite) Milla Jovovich make a great team as two long time friends who
help each other to fulfill their dreams, because that is the message
this movie gives, taking a chance at life and doing what you love, no
mater where you are in life, like in the song (which by the way, the
music in this movie is great too). This film is definitely one that can
be enjoyed over and over again. One of my favorite independent movies.
And I&#39;m hope you&#39;ll enjoy it too. the Michael has spoken.
