Writer/Director Greg Pritkin's formula for a brilliant comedy is so
simple you wonder why it is not being widely copied. You write a
quality screenplay, assemble an ensemble of very strong actors, turn
this cast loose to slightly overplay each of your quirky characters,
and find a quality editor to creatively assemble the film.<br /><br />Of course writing or finding a screenplay this good is not easy, nor is
assembling a dream cast like this one. Getting Adrien Brody, Milla
Jovovich, Illeana Douglas, Vera Farmiga, and Jared Harris to play your
five main characters is almost unparalleled. All are extremely strong
actors who were attracted to this quirky project because Pritkin was
willing to turn them loose to play off each other. Because each
character in &quot;Dummy&quot; is at least slightly off-kilter these over-the-top
performances achieve a wonderful balance.<br /><br />The cast has a Ukrainian favor, with Jovovich playing a hilarious role
totally unlike anything you have seen from her (there are some
similarities to her &quot;Zoolander&quot; character) and Farmiga who is fantastic
as always. The &quot;R&quot; rating is solely due to Milla's language much of
which is simply the funniest swearing in film history. Vera is
absolutely fantastic as the guest at the family dinner table-less
extreme yet funnier than the family dinner scene in the &quot;The Nutty
Professor&quot;. <br /><br />Jovovich's line about doing the &quot;hora&quot; refers to a dance frequently
done at Jewish weddings. If you want to do it at your own wedding here
are some instructions: 1. Stand in a circle holding the hands of the
people on either side of you. 2. When the music starts, follow the
circle as it rotates. 3. Step to the side, passing your left foot
behind your right. 4. Move the right foot beside the left foot. 5. Step
to the side again, passing your left foot in front of your right this
time. 6. Continue as the circle keeps spinning, adding a little hop to
your steps as you go faster. 7. Move toward the center of the circle
and throw your hands, still holding those of the people beside you, in
the air. 8. Lower your hands and move backward. 9. Repeat several
times. 10. Resume spinning around the circle.
