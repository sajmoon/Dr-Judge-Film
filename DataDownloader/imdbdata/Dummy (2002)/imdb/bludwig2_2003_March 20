I saw this at the South By Southwest film festival, I hope they get great
distribution for this.  Many movies are supposed to be &quot;comedies&quot; and, in
fact, aren't really that funny.  This movie made me and my wife laugh out
loud more than other movie in recent memory.   Adrien Brody (the Pianist's
star) does a fantastic job.  He apparently had to learn how to be a
ventriloquist from scratch and learned in only 3 weeks and, according to
the
Director's Q/A at the end of the film's screening, he is actually was a
better ventriloquist than he is portrayed in the movie.  Milla Jovovich
steals the show with an intense punk-rocker part.  The way she changes her
musical styles through the movie was hysterical to me.  This movie
connected
with me in a touching way and I'm not even Jewish or Italian!
