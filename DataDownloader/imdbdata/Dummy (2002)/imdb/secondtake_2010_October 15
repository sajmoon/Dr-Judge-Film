Dummy (2002)<br /><br />A fun, offbeat, somewhat frivolous charcoal gray comedy. It&#x27;s hilarious
in spots and touching in spots, and has some terrific acting. The
overall scenario is a situation comedy, drawn out over the hour and a
half, and it might have made a tighter hour long television show. At
times it seems to really hit an eccentric tone that&#x27;s terrific and even
a little surreal, as with some of the family interactions, played with
beautiful deadpan steadiness. And when it&#x27;s a moving romantic comedy,
you appreciate the restrained, sympathetic acting of several of the
leads. There isn&#x27;t a bad performance in the lot of them.
