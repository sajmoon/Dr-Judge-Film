With the combination of Spike Lee and Denzel Washington together for
one film, it's destined to be worthwhile. This film follows Lee's
unique directing style and Denzel's outstanding acting ability to make
a dark, eye-opening work of art. <br /><br />Jake Shuttlesworth (Washington) is put in prison for the murder of his
wife.<br /><br />He has not had a civil conversation with his son, Jesus (Ray Allen)
since then, but years later he is offered a shorter prison sentence if
he can convince Jesus to play basketball for Big State University. As
the two confront the past and struggle to accept each other's lives,
basketball is all they have in common. Jesus and his girlfriend Lala
(Rosario Dawson) are both faced with the harsh reality of greed, sex,
drugs, bribery, and the gritty life of professional basketball.
Meanwhile, Jake copes with life as a lonely felon while mending his
relationships with his children. The film allows the audience to get to
know each character on a deeply personal level and in an entertaining
way. <br /><br />Lee uses very creative filming techniques to make potentially boring
sequences intriguing and engaging. From introducing Jesus' basketball
team to reading letters, the shots and angles are continually changing
on-screen. The most effective technique would have to be the editing of
parallel scenes between father and son, showing their athletic
similarities and identical mannerisms unbeknownst to them to the
audience. As always, Denzel Washington gives a brilliant performance.
Ray Allen, a professional basketball player, portrays the character of
Jesus. He makes a fairly weak actor, but his role is strengthened by
his costars Washington and the under-rated, Dawson.<br /><br />He Got Game was a surprisingly enjoyable film. It was able to balance
the contrast between attention grabbing basketball scenes and emotional
father-son moments. The film portrays the bitter truth of professional
sports, as awful and selfish as it can seem, making it darker and more
graphic than many people prefer. I would recommend this film to anyone,
especially to sports or Denzel fans. Overall, He Got Game was an
exciting, beautiful, and well-made film showing what it takes to &quot;have
game&quot; whether it's on the court, or behind the camera.
