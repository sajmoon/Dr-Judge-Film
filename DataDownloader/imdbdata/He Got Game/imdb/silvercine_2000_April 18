I don't know why some people wont just go ahead and admit they enjoyed
this
film. It was chock full of great filmmaking splendor. The use of an Aaron
Copland alone was genius. Great characters and definitely great
cinematography. Okay the dialog wasn't great and Ray Allen's performance
wasn't oscar caliber(it's his first time acting!). This film still goes
into
my favorite films list along with other Spike Lee Joints such as Mo Better
Blues, Malcolm X, and Do The Right Thing. There is no doubt in my mind
that
Spike Lee is one of the greatest filmmakers in history. Malcolm X, and Do
The
Right thing deserved to be on the AFI 100 films list. But great
masterpieces
like Fargo needed to be on there. Blah Blah Bladdy Blah
Blah.
