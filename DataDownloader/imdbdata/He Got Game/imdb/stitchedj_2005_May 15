I liked this movie when I saw it (1999 or so), but I thought some of
the content was a little over the top, particularly overt use of sex to
recruit ball-players. Recent sex/recruiting scandals at schools like
Colorado and Rice serve as evidence of how visionary Spike Lee really
was, though.<br /><br />Also, I like the emotional and moral complexity of Denzel Washington's
Jake, who isn't the brightest or most comforting character he's ever
played. Washington doesn't really have great lines with which to work;
the magic in his portrayal is more subtle and elemental. Ray Allen is
almost as good as Denzel.<br /><br />Stylistically, even almost a decade later this is a remarkably edited
film, with a great score. Despite dealing with many disturbing themes,
this is ultimately a very enjoyable story. I think I enjoyed it more
recently than when it was released.
