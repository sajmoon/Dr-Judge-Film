2005_August 8 
This movie was excellent, even though I am not a basketball fan. But
the music and the story of a promising high school basketball player,
who is being recruited by the top colleges for scholarships, and the
bitter reunion with his prisoner father who accidentally killed his
wife, and the boy's mother. The entire movie is a sort of reunion, and
a soul searching for both the father and son. D. Washington and Ray
Allen both give exceptional performances. The last scene of the movie
has symbolism, in that while Washington is playing basketball in
Attica, his son is playing in Big State university (Part of a deal by
the governor to recruit the boy into his alma mater in exchange for
lessening the father's remaining sentence), their actions are mirrored,
and when Jake sends his ball skyward, it drops right in the lap of
Jesus, where he takes the ball and finally smiles and accepts his
father. I also see it as the ball being the North Star which led Jesus
to Bethlehem, and guided his road to wisdom from then on. See it by all
means.
