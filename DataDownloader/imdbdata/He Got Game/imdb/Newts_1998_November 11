More evidence that basketball stars should remain basketball stars, and to
stay out of acting. Denzel Washington, in an implosive performance,
literally acts circles around his untrained co-star, Ray Allen. While
Allen's inept acting skills drag the film into moments of unintentional
comedy, there is much to praise here. Lee's fabulous use of colors,
underlined with Aaron Copland's amazing score, combines to create some
excellent scenes. A sub-plot with a hooker (Jovovich) fails, but there are
some serious father-son relations explored here. Watch for two extremely
powerful moments: where Jesus goes for reality check cruise with Big Time,
and his final showdown with his girlfriend Lala.
