A smart nevertheless unforgettable tale of a prisoner (Denzel
Washington),
who is offered a chance to have his prison sentence reduced if he can
persuade his estranged and bitter son (Ray Allen), a highly sought after
college basketball recruit, to sign a letter of intent for the governor's
favorite college in one week.  Writer-director Spike Lee dishes out a
simply
magnificent story of the never-ending (and outrageous) offers that the son
has presented to him besides trying to confront his father.  The message
that this movie is willing to make isn't forced, but only displayed in
such
unsettling detail.  Washington is fine and Allen himself holds his ground
here fairly well.
