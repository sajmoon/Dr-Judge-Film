Spike Lee makes a movie for Disney.It was only a matter of time before
Spike
tried his hand at a basketball film and this is a worthwhile if flawed
effort. Denzel Washington is great as Jake and the film is directed
brilliantly. However half way through it is easy to see how the whole
thing
is going to end and the whole finish disappoints. Still there is much to
enjoy here such as the use of Aaron Copland's stirring music and the
towering performance of Mr Washington.
