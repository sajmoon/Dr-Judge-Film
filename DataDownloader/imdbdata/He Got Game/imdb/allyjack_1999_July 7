1999_July 7 

The movie's flaws may stick in the mind more than its considerable
strengths:
Lee's superb orchestration of the pressures that attend the
acknowledged
rising star - driven home with shining cars and watches and almost
comically
available big-breasted women and unexplained bundles of money; the
coach,
the girlfriend, the uncle are all on the take. The cumulative impact is
powerful even if you're not sure about some of the details. But the main
plotline with
Washington is pretty familiar and doesn't amount to much
whichever
character you concentrate on - we've all seen such familial
pressures/strife
played out at the intersection of sports and tough love before. The
subplot
of Washington finding genuine tenderness with hooker Jovovich is
pretty
useless too. Lee's montages are wonderful but the Aaron Copland music
may
actually be TOO stirring and much of the film resembles nothing as much
as
image ads for the NBA. Generally engrossing but overall too
long.
