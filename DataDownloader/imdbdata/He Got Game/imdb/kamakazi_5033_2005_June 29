The best basketball movie ever made, hands down. Its only competition:
Hoosiers, White Man Can't Jump, and, maybe, Blue Chips (really, though,
Ray Allen and Rick Fox, do a hell of a better job than Shaq and Penny
Hordaway). This movie seemed a bit questionable acting- wise, with Ray
Allen having the supporting role and Rosaria Dawson playing Jesus's
girlfriend, but honestly, it's pretty hard to tell (Milla Jovavich is
even in the movie); of course, it all centers around Denzel's
performance, and he does an excellent job. Spike Lee put together
another great movie. Personally, I liked how he did the subplot cut
scenes, as they quickly come while people are talking about them; all
of them easy to understand and not drawn out as in most movies. Of
course Spike's most artistic touch came at the very end; an excellent
abstract scene to close the film. My only problem with the movie was
the over-usage of the dramatic, classical music; it felt as if it
didn't fit right with what was going on in the scene. This is only a
minor problem, though. Overall: 9/10.
