2003_January 30 

Firstly, I have a confession to make.  I know almost nothing about Spike
Lee.  I'll have to find out more about him some day, I suppose - anyone who
can attract so much controversy just by opening his mouth is clearly worth
paying attention to.  But so far, the only films of his that I've watched
are this and 'Girl 6' (1995).  Yeah, you see why I don't know much about him
now, don't you?  <br /><br />'He Got Game' is nowhere near as bad as 'Girl 6'.  In fact, there are bits
of it that are rather good.  I can believe Ed Norton when he defends the
movie as being &quot;almost like a tone poem&quot; - it has that quality to it.  It's
certainly more contemplative than those who paint Lee as a ranting
rabble-rouser would have you believe.  And this may be my favourite Denzel
Washington performance - it's one of his more relaxed, least self-conscious
turns.  And that may well be enough to recommend the film on its own.  But
there are serious flaws.  <br /><br />Chief amongst these is that Spike Lee is clearly the Grand Master of
cinematic misogyny.  Sometimes I'm in the mood to watch a film which I
politically disagree with and just let it slide, appreciating it on its
artistic merits only.  'He Got Game' caught me in a very, very bad mood
indeed.  I was amused to see that Lee falls into the same category as the
totally talentless Larry Clark in confusing higher education with an Annabel
Chong movie.  His insanely oversexed vision of college life is amusing for a
while, but soon grates, even if you're not one of the poor souls forced to
trudge daily through this costly and depressing educational system. <br /><br />Overall, the best thing about 'He Got Game' is the superb score by Public
enemy - the title track in particular is a fine, much-overlooked work from
these giants of hip-hop.  And as for the rest of the film?  Erm... dunno. 
You might like it.  In the meantime, I'll be off to book my tickets for
'25th Hour' (2002).
