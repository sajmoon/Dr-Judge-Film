My two favorite Spike Lee movies are &quot;Clockers&quot; and &quot;He Got
Game&quot; and they share similarities: both are about  guys trying to
keep integrity amidst characters whose primary motives are to
persuade him to leave the path.<br /><br />&quot;He Got Game&quot; gets the edge because I love basketball and
because I'm a sucker for well done father-son conflicts. The
basketball parts of this movie are absolutely brilliantly shot. Most
sports movies share two commonalities: completely ridiculous
storylines and actors who throw like sissies. He Got Game avoids
both.<br /><br />Okay, some parts of the story are hoky, but allowable. But what
makes this movie work, similar to &quot;Clockers&quot; is that you get
sucked into a main character whose nobility is tested at every turn.
Will Jesus Shuttlesworth make it through the maze or fall prey to
it? And will he be able to recognize that his father is not just one
more flesh peddler? It makes for good drama. But above that, the
basketball scenes just completely rock. They're examples of
absolutely masterful cinematography and editing. In fact, the movie
has some of the best montage sequences every put on film.
Seriously.<br /><br />Denzel is excellent in this movie. He plays a Jeckyll and Hyde and
plays both sides well. This conflicted character was very easy to
root for. (I can identify.) NBA perennial All-Star Ray Allen, while
more than a little stiff at times, holds his own as a non-actor in a
dramatic role.<br /><br />He Got Game is a flawed piece of work: parts drag, it's not without
its hokiness, and the subplot with Denzel and Jojovovich didn't
quite fit. But the essential storylines work and play true: you believe
in a conflict between father and son and you root for a high school
basketball player who requires the wisdom of an adult to avoid the
flesh peddlers. Kudos to Spike for not trying to hit us over the had
with his message, but letting it unravel naturally.
