He Got Game hit home for me, because I don't have a father in my life. As
an
aspring filmaker I always have dreams that my father will come back at a
crucial point in my life as Denzel did to Ray in this movie. This a movie
that every father and son should see. The cinematography, script and acting
are all top notch. One of Spike's best films since Clockers.
