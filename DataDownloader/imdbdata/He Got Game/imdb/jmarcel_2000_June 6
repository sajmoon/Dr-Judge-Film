Lee's He Got Game displays similar gritty street imagery as his earlier
Clockers. While not as captivating as the earlier movie, He Got Game, does
elicit a raw sense of power and visual style which should please
movie-goers. Those looking for a combination of fast breaking basketball
sequences and slam dunk music video highlights will not find what they want
in this film. While the movie does include a few basketball scenes, it
focuses more on the human story of choice, responsibility, societal
pressures, and heroism. He Got Game is a tough, human drama, flawed in some
of the dialog, but with an outstanding performance from Denzel. Lee's in
your face film-making once again shines through in this urban father-son
relationship film.
