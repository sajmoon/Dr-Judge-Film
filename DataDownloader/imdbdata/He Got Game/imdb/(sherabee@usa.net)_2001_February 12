I don't really know how to rate this movie.  The movie was pretty good.
Denzel was excellent.  His son was a little extreme in his behavior. The
ending was messed up.  Part of the movie is a 10.  Then you have to take
away a point for the sons behavior and a point for the ending.  Okay, I'll
give it an 8.
