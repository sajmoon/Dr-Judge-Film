1999_March 19 

I thought this movies hits in places films have a hard time hitting. There
was a strong family (father &amp; son) message that I  was extremely impressed
with. The cinematography was amazing with a strong use of color and several
stunning shots. But there are too many negative aspects. This movie clearly
portrays white women as loose and whores. Black women aren't particularly
celebrated either. And I also think the sound track was out of place several
times during the movie. Overall, it is worth seeing but, I wouldn't show my
kids, if I had any.
