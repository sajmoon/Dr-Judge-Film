The most beautiful music ever used to portray a characters feelings and
emotions. Other than the music the story, acting and cinematography are
great, very well thought out and very original. Even though I&#39;m not a
professional film critic I would recommend this movie to anyone who
thinks sport films have no actual plot other than a struggling team
which triumphs in the end. I would also recommend this film to
basketball fans because professional Basketball player Ray Allen who
currently plays for the Seattle Supersonics is the 2nd main character
&quot;Jesus&quot; in the movie.<br /><br />Fantastic film, please watch and post your review!!!
