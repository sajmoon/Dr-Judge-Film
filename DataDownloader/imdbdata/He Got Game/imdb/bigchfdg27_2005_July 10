Denzel is a great actor and shows his versatility in this role. I
appreciate Spike's use of Ray Allen. Though he does not act well his
average acting skills bring a bit of realness to his role and I knew he
drew upon personal experience in playing this role. I liked how Spike
used the backdrop of the hood. The supporting cast was great as well
and Spike Lee usually makes full use of them. As a person who is from
Brooklyn I love how Spike made use of the rides and the love making
scenes were particularly good. He has gotten a lot better in ensuring
that realistically everything is played out to perfection. Overall I
was pleased with everyones performance. Kudos to Spike, Ray Allen and
Denzel. ONce again Denzel rocks as a volatile character.
