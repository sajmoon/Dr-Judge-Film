1999_February 13 

Lee is one of the few directors working who is actually looking for a new
approach to the entire cinematic process.  While everybody is awaiting the
return of Stanley Kubrick, Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and Kevin
Smith, wondering what happened to Robert Altman's comeback that seemed so
hopeful in 1993, Spike Lee has continually marched to the beat of a
different drummer.  &quot;He Got Game&quot; has one of the most memorable ferris wheel
rides since &quot;The Third Man&quot;, breathtaking cinematography, outrageous satire
worthy of Luis Bunuel and Lindsay Anderson (truly, more than a few
connections can be drawn between &quot;...Game&quot; and &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot;), and
irreproachable soundtrack selection.<br /><br />The movie, as I expected, disappointed a great many people, and confused a
great deal more, but it hooked me.  I overlooked the misfired ending, and
landed the film on my 10 best of '98.  Please see the film, and with an open
mind--there's a lot to admire here.
