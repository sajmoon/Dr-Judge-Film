Spike Lee directed one of the better basketball films, 'He Got Game',
films.<br /><br />&quot;He Got Game&quot; is a very moving story with a very diverse plot. There
are many aspects to this film that make it a great one, from the plot
in general, to the characters and their development, and the sound
track as well. <br /><br />It did, however, seem as though Spike Lee was almost getting too
sidetracked in some areas of the plot. The films primarily seemed to
focus around the relationship between the father (Jake) and his son
(Jesus), but it seemed as though Spike Lee added to many unnecessary
smaller stories happening throughout the movie. One of the side plots
that happened was the relationship with Jesus and their next-door
neighbor, who happened to be a prostitute. Another event going on was
the fathers whole issues with his two parole officers, and it also
seemed that this movie did not even necessarily have to be so much
about the sport of basketball.<br /><br />Something else that was bothering about this film was how unrealistic
the situation was that took place in it, with the compromise or trade
that had been agreed upon. It just simply would never happen that some
one would agree to let an accused murderer out of jail early in order
to have a very talented high school basket ball player agree to play
for certain school. Another unrealistic aspect to this film was how
much Spike Lee blew up the seriousness of being recruited, although it
could have just been the town they lived in, much like the film &quot;Friday
Night Lights&quot; and the seriousness that occurred there. <br /><br />Although in the latter, many negative aspects were pointed out, all in
all it was a great film; it had an extremely interesting plot that kept
ones attention throughout the whole film.
