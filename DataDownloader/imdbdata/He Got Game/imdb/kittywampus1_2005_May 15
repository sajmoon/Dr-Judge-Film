As a longtime Sonics fan, I had to see this. Ray Allen wasn't a Sonic
when it first came out &amp; somehow this movie didn't register on my radar
til recently. Hardly a blip. It lacked the usual edge of a Spike Lee
film and I found nothing compelling about the characters or story. I
kept watching in hopes of seeing some good ball footage. The cameo
appearances were the only fun parts. A sappy movie that would be weak;
even if made for TV. It's NBA playoff season and I DO love the game.
Thought this might be an interesting way to spend the evening, but
looks like watching a rerun of one of the Bulls vs. Wizards games might
have been more exciting.
