I recently watched this movie for the first time, and as a 19 year old
black male it spoke to me. However, I can see this being a film that
everyone can appreciate. Especially now, with Lebron James and other
upcoming HS athletes, you really see the other side of life that only
they know.<br /><br />This movie detailed the life of the #1 basketball star in HS, and the
issues he deals with before he announces his plans for the future,
further complicated by his father's contingent release from jail.<br /><br />A GREAT movie, don't let the votes fool you, it's not a 6.5/10, more
like 8.5.
