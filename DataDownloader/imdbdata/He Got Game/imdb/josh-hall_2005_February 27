I brought this film from ebay a couple of months ago as you can never
find it anywhere in England. Iwatch it and i thought it was an abslute
perfection from the amazing Spike Lee and far superior to a lot of his
other movies at the time. I like this Lee film in particular though
because it is more character driven and has more emotion to most of
Lee's films. Denzel Washington has again proved he is one of the all
time greatest living actors with his strong performance as Jake
Shuttlesworth who makes friends in the film with a prostitute
(beautifully played by Milla Jovovich). But what also surprises me
about this film is the fact that the main character Jesus Shuttlesworth
played by Ray Allen is not even an actor! Yet his performance is
extraordinary in this is one of the best i've seen in any Spike Lee
film just after Denzel's in Malcolm x and Edward Norton's in 25th Hour.
All in all the stylish story, acting,cinematography and the mastery of
Lee's directing this is one of my instant Spike LEE classics. Ten out
of ten.
