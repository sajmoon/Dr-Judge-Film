1999_April 7 

Denzel Washington and Ray Allen were excellent but other than that I didn't
really think this film worked. The plot was simple enough: convince your son
to go to a certain college and you will get reduced time off your sentence.
I expected Spike Lee to do a b job with bringing father and son closer
together. It is typical Spike Lee style to make a film about basketball when
the director himself is seen at Madison Square Garden watching the Knicks
play, to have basketball players starring in his film. Another problem that
this film has is the fact that it has more than enough graphic sexual
content and language. It could have been a lot better if the sexual content
some of the language were edited out of the script. In my opinion, the
basketball players overshadowed the regular actors except for Denzel.
Everybody from Rick Fox to Walter McCarty did a better job acting than the
rest of the cast, and that would be the only reason I would recommend He Got Game.
