He got game is perhaps Spike Lee's most least appreciated work, and
doesn't get the recognition it deserves is such a fine fine film. From
start to finish He got game presents a moving storyline amid Aaron
Copland's classics. The juxtaposition of this music with basketball and
urban life is absolutely genius. Sayeed's Cinematography as always
makes a lasting impressions as well. Denzel is at the top of his game
yet again, and the choice of Ray Allen is perfect. He got game is a
story about American life, and the American family. Spike's use of
symbolism through the game of basketball is phenomenal and moving.
There's not a single director other than Spike who could have pulled
off this American classic.
