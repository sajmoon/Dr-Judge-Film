It finally happened, and the movie we 
all thought Spike Lee would make 
became reality. With Lee's own little foray 
into the basketball world, I always wondered 
when he would create a story which 
reflected his unique views of the game. 
While sometimes over sensationalized, 
he depicted a seedy world comprised 
of two-faced individuals all the way 
down to the seedy high school coach 
to the professional agent. I also felt it 
depicted some very frank images of the 
cultural aspects of athletics, the sex, 
the money and the little freebies. While 
the film didn't need the story between 
Denzel Washington and Milla Jovovich, 
it was strong in most aspects. It was a 
bit of a change of pace for Spike Lee, 
considering the graininess of the film 
stock and the rather mundane colors. 
Also, Ray Allen had one of the best pro 
athletes-turned-actor performances in a 
long time.
