It&#39;s not only that He Got Game&#39;s young main character is named Jesus-
though that is a very obvious point writer/director Spike Lee puts out
there just to nail it (no pun intended) across- but just the entire
scope of the picture, individual scenes, that paint this as a kind of
modern religious fable. God isn&#39;t exactly present throughout the
picture (surely the sex scenes and &#39;bad&#39; language don&#39;t make it very
holy for many audiences), but Lee&#39;s tale, however contrived to fit
around the premise of a convict (Denzel Washington) being released for
a week to try and lock-down his estranged son into a college the
governor wants, strikes a chord almost in spite of its limitations.
It&#39;s about forgiveness on a base level, about resisting temptations on
all fronts, about reconciliation, and about not becoming holier than
thou. In a strange way having the character named Jesus deflects the
whole point: Jake, Jesus&#39;s father, named him for a *former* NBA player
nicknamed Jesus, a sweet irony unto itself.<br /><br />What&#39;s most surprising for me is that within the set boundaries of the
contrivances, both in the grand piece of the premise and in little
occurrences like Jake being situated right next door to a beat up
prostitute, Spike Lee has created a work of fiery passion and care and
detail. It&#39;s a good script first and foremost as just a morality tale
played out as realistically as imaginable (or as realistically in a
Joint of his) and then elevated through his steadfast direction and the
performances. No accident then that basketball is both the main focus
of the trials and tribulations of the characters of Jake and Jesus in
the story AND Spike Lee&#39;s main joy aside from film-making. It goes
without saying there are still pieces of social commentary throughout,
not least of which from a character named &#39;Big Time&#39; who rolls around
Coney Island pontificating about &quot;life on the streets&quot; or more
obviously by the traps of fame and fortune in pro-basketball in
colleges. It&#39;s how Lee works in the real personal issues, of the more
intimate scenes (and not the ones you think are intimate, not sex
scenes save for a brief one between Jovovich and Washington), that
makes it work.<br /><br />So, amid the high-flying camera shots and subliminal editing and
specific usage of colors and filters as metaphors and the slow-motion
shots of the basketball flying through the air as if out in space and
lost in time, with taking aside Lee&#39;s firm strengths here as a
filmmaker, the acting shines out better than expected. In his one real
performance (he&#39;s appeared in one other film that may or may not have
been smaller), Ray Allen plays Jesus without pretension and without
ever sounding much of a false note. It could come off as weak to some
as he occasionally tries to rise up to the challenge of getting to that
level of his fellow actors emotionally. Some may say that, which is
fine. But with the scenes he had with the likes of Denzel Washington he
held his own wonderfully, with his older quasi-counterpart delivering
another great turn in a Lee picture. While it also goes without saying
the two of them are stuck in a manipulative &quot;uplifting&quot; ending with the
ball flying over one wall into the court, they&#39;re actors made for this
kind of story and characters- they also play a mean game of ball to
boot in a (pleasantly) uncharacteristic one-on-one climax game.<br /><br />He Got Game has its clich&eacute;s, its sentimental bits, and its characters
brought over from other sports-related dramas. It&#39;s also wiser than
other crude Hollywood product, it&#39;s got sharper and nearly
quintessential Spike Lee dialog, and it even features a perfect
semblance of rousing score from Aaron Copeland and very cool songs from
Public Enemy. And if it delivers a message that isn&#39;t too hackneyed
under the circumstances, that&#39;s fine too, and with everything against
it via its premise Lee&#39;s made one of his better pictures- good even if
you&#39;re not big into the sport. 8.5/10
