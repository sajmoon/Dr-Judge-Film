This movie is nearly perfect. Just spectacular. If you're a basketball
fan, you will enjoy it for sure. Jesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen,
Seattle Supersonics), lives in Coney Island, NY, and is the top
basketball prospect in America. He lives with his Sister, and his Aunt
and Uncle are his legal guardians. His father, Jake, killed Jesus'
mother when he was about 12. Obviously, Jesus hates him for that. Jake
is offered a shorter stay in prison if he can convince his son to go to
a certain college. He has one week. <br /><br />I couldn't believe it when I saw the low overall rating for this movie.
It so well made, Public Enemy's soundtrack is MINDBLOWING. Ray Allen is
a good actor, and Denzel Washington is great, like always. The ONE
thing that was slightly disappointing was the strange ending. The
ending was rushed and corny. That's my opinion.<br /><br />10/10
