1999_July 19 

&quot;He Got Game&quot; was a horrible film. First of all, Ray Allen? You can play
basketball, but you can't act. Sorry. The amount of graphic sexual content
was unnecessary and revolting. They made getting into college look like an
orgy. If you haven't already seen this movie, then be glad. The ending was
very confusing, and the whole movie was too. I give it a 3 out of 10, and
only because Denzel Washington is so great.
