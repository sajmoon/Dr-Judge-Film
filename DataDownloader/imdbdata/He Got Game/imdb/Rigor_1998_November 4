Denzel Washington has one of his greatest charcaters in Jake
Shuttlesworth in this compelling film by Spike Lee. Jake is a man serving a
life sentence for the accidental murder of his wife during a domestic
dispute. The dispute centered around Jake's aggressive coaching of his young
son Jesus who he is obsessed with turning into a basketball star. As the
film opens we learn that Jesus (effectively played by Ray Allen) has indeed
become a high school basketball star and is being now aggressively pursued
by University teams and commercial agents.
In a somewhat fanciful, yet unfortunately believable plot device the
Governor promises Jake early release from prison if he can convince his son
to go to Big State.  Much of this film is amazingly well executed my only
regret comes around some of the gender politics of the film (many of the
female characters are underdeveloped and/or cartoonishly stereotyped). This
is particularly unfortunate because the film has so much to say about the
intersections of patriarchy/economic injustice/racism that I wish Spike Lee
could have been a little more consistent with his development of the women
characters (one notable exception is a brilliantly realized performance by
Milla Javovich as a prostitute that rooms next to Jake). This said the film
is still an important accomplishment and should be seen.
