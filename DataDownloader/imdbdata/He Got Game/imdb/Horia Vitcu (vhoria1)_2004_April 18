Made for people who &quot;love this game&quot;.
A story about people's feelings when it comes
to money and success.Jesus get his know how from his dad
who gets sentenced to jail.
There are a lot of nice scenes for the basketball lovers
and a lot of real stuff about what happens behind the beautiful
stages of nba entartainment.
A nice movie which can give you a pretty good 
impression about what it's like to be really
talented but really poor, the way from poor to
rich and famous is not a smooth path.
