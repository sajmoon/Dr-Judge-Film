He Got Game is basically a story of redemption for a conflicted family
of father and son played over the setting of basketball. The movie
alludes to so many possible and actual struggles a man may face but its
particularly speaking whether intentionally or subliminally of the
African American experience. Though one may not see the plot being
focused as it tends to go in several different directions, at times its
a perfectly frustrating example of how out of control a life may become
if the right choices aren&#39;t made.<br /><br />Denzel&#39;s portrayal of Jake Shuttlesworth is a prime example of a flawed
but strong willed individual who angrily imposes himself onto his son
to succeed at where he most likely failed. In the process he pushes his
son away and in a sense sends him on a path to be that same angry man
he became. Ray Allen as Jesus Shuttlesworth has so many options but no
answers as he takes the weight of the world on his shoulders. His
character is that of kid presented with choices forcing him to become a
man. But without guidance since he essentially raised himself and his
sister in the absence of his father and death of his mother, Jesus is
vulnerable to all the temptation around him.<br /><br />Spike Lee forces points down your throat unnecessarily with explicit
sex scenes which he does way too often in just about all of his films
but though uncomfortable, it works in the aspect of this film. Seeing
Jesus and Jake grind it out in a game of one on one is a great climax
brought to a head after Jesus&#39;s several rejections of his father
acceptance and Jake&#39;s realization of his time running out. The lesson
taught is a great lesson learned and in the end redemption is found
through the strength of understanding between father and son.
