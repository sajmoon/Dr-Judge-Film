Director Spike Lee loves basketball. You can see him court side at
Knicks games. A basketball movie fits right in with his love and this
one starring Denzel Washington as a father let out of prison to
convince his son to sign for the Governor&#39;s alma mater is not a bad
movie. Of course Denzel&#39;s mission is complicated by the fact that he is
in prison for killing his son&#39;s mother, and he named him &quot;Jesus.&quot; Try
to overcome that! But, we do get a good father-son movie in the
attempt.<br /><br />Really, anytime we get to see Denzel is a good thing, and this also has
Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil) and Rosario Dawson (Sin City,
Grindhouse), and birthday girl, Jennifer Esposito. Of course, crash is
a better vehicle for seeing Jennifer, but this one was available for a
birthday tribute.<br /><br />The only thing I don&#39;t like about Lee&#39;s movies is, that with few
exceptions, he portrays all his female characters (in the current
vernacular) as &quot;nappy headed ho&#39;s.&quot; This one is no exception.
