This is a great movie. It was entertaining throughout, and any weakness in
the movie's narrative flow is more than made up for by the powerful and
spiritual message of forgiveness. I don't want to give the plot away, so
all
I'll say is that a scene near the end between Denzel's character and his
son
blew me away.  I could hardly get up to leave the theater.  As often
happens
with Spike's films, I don't think most people got what he was trying to do
and say here. Vastly under-rated and overlooked, this movie has real value
to the right viewers. It wasn't just about the temptations of a highschool
basketball star. Rent it!
