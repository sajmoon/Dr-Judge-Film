Sports movies are hard to make, if just because the filmmaker has to stay
within the traditional structures of a picture while incorporating exciting
sports sequences that do not appear contrived or rehearsed. In that sense,
hiring Ray Allen to play Jesus Shuttlesworth, the movie's central figure (
even if Denzel Washington is unbelievable and tends to overshine in every
scene he is in), because we know he can really play ball, but also that he
has been through a lot of the stress his character is going through (that
is
choosing his future college, all the while being hyped &quot;the greatest thing
to happen to bball since the tennis shoe was invented&quot;). Granted Allen is
no
method actor, but he is more than OK. I probably am biased since basketball
is such an important part of my life, but at least I can say that this is
the greatest ball movie ever to have hit the screen. Some of the themes may
be unfamiliar to some, but all in all the movie is moving and
thought-inducing without being sanctimonious, which is all too rare in
today's media-rule-all world. The intro alone, with the great idea of
having
put Aaron Copland music, illustrates how important basketball is in America
and to the lives of millions. If you're a bball fan watch it immediately,
if
you're not give it a try anyway !
