Spike Lee presents us with another compelling and well-made film. This time,
the subject is college basketball. Jesus Shuttlesworth, played by NBA star
Ray Allen, is a top high school prospect. He is being pursued by alot of top
colleges. The governor is an graduate of Big State and offers Jesus's father
Jake (Denzel Washington) an early parole if he can get his son to commit to
Big State. Jake is in jail for killing Jesus's mom and their relationship is
understandably strained and tense. The scenes with Allen and Washington are
convincing and intense. The basketball scenes played by Allen are great. He
really does have game! Adding to the realism, many top college coaches and
NBA stars like Dean Smith and Scottie Pippen appear as themselves in an ESPN
report about Jesus. <br /><br />Everyone wants a piece of Jesus, whether it's his father, the colleges
recruiting him, his uncle who helped raise him or even his girlfriend (the
sexy Rosario Dawson). They all want something from him, either his presence
on their team or a part of the wealth he'll get one day in the NBA. Jake
wants not only an early release, but to rebuild his relationship with his
son.<br /><br />Lee's script is well-written and his direction strong, as usual. The tension
between father and son and Jake's relationship with the hooker he meets
(Milla Jovovich) are the high points of the film. The song in the closing
credits even manages to bring together Public Enemy and Stephen Stills! 8
