1999_December 18 

Cut out the extra flesh/porno scenes (&quot;campus&quot; cuties) and this is a
fabulous and total work of art, passionate and everything in artistic
balance.  But no, Spike Lee had to do the T&amp;A thing.  Denzel Washington
shows what it's like to earn and carry the weight of hard time; all the
actors play in sensitive ensemble working their own games; the color
quality/musical blend is pure and unique.  I really loved this movie and
found the campus white-meat sex scenes stupid.
