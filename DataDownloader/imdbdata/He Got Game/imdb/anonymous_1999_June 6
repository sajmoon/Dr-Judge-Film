1999_June 6 

Another masterpiece from Spike Lee.  He uses his knowledge of the inner
city
and the HoopDreams of young inner city kids to make this movie amazing.
Ray
Allen not only has great action scences on the court but provides a
believable performance as Jesus Schuttlesworth who can trust noone and
must
forgive his father.  Denzel Washington seems at home with his inner city
accent and has one of his best performances.  Spike Lee uses camera work
in
slow motion to show the beauty of the game and the struggle of hard off
kids. Spike Lee writes a masterpiece and it is beautifully performed by
Ray
Allen and Denzel Washington.
