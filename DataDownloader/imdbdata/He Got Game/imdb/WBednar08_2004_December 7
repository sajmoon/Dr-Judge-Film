I think that this movie shows a very interesting side of basketball and
also of all sports in general. It shows how a lot of people will try and
cling on to a star athlete in order to share his spot light. It becomes
difficult for the athlete for the athlete to figure out who really
cares about them, and who is just along for the ride. This movie is
about a basketball star who is trying to figure out who really cares
about him at a time when he needs guidance the most. I thought that the
performance given by Denzel Washington as Jesus' father was excellent,
and I was surprised by the performance given by Ray Allen as Jesus
Shuttlesworth, considering he is not really known as an actor. I
thought that he did a very good job, and created a very believable
character. The one thing that I did not like about this movie was that
I thought that it was a little too long, and I thought that it could
have been shortened. I also did really understand what the montage at
the beginning of the movie had to do with the rest of the story.
Overall, I thought that it was a good movie and I think that the plot
becomes even more interesting as we see more and more high school
athletes in a similar situation a the star, Jesus Shuttlesworth.
