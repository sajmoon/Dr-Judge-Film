I thought Spike was very careful, maybe too careful in trying not to
duplicate the movie &#39;Blue Chips&#39;. The big risk he took in this movie
was fictionalizing something that is not all that fictional in the
recruitment of inner-city youths - that is, the family issues, the
pressure of sudden notoriety, and the pressure from recruiters that
these kids face. Personally, I thought he displayed this pretty
accurately, while others I know who have seen this movie thought that
much of it was far fetched, especially that a governor would be
involved. Still, everyone I have talked to about this movie was
impressed with Ray Allen&#39;s performance. If you&#39;re not a Spike Lee fan
to begin with, nor have ever been through the college recruiting
process, this movie won&#39;t make you a Spike Lee fan. If you are a Spike
Lee fan or have been recruited, it&#39;s easy to believe the story line.
