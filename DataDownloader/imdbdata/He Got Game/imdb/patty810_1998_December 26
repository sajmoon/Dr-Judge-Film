1998_December 26 

Denzel Washington's performance is amazing, and a delight to watch. He is so
good that I was able to forget for long minutes that it was a movie while
under his spell. The story is plausible enough, and beautifully filmed,
although I can't help but wonder if the temptations that face a rising
basketball star are quite as vicious as pictured here. Three things
subtracted from what would otherwise be a real work of art: (1) The large
amount of graphic sexual content really wasn't necessary. (2) The point of
character Jesus Shuttlesworth's first name was really not clear, yet it was
ceaselessly trumpeted and highlighted; it was a distracting, muddy concept.
(3) The ending was extremely disappointing and bizarre.<br /><br />Up until the very last few minutes, I was entirely taken in by this film.
The ending, however, left me feeling somewhat ripped off. Still, I found
myself thinking about the movie for hours afterwards, and even lying awake
at night trying to come up with the ending that I would like to have seen.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what Aaron Copeland's music had to do with the urban black
setting of the story, and I wished that there was a lot more of Public
Enemy.
