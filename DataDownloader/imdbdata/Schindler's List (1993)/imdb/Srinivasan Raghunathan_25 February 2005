Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, is based on the novel
written by Thomas Keneally. At the height of WW II, the Jews are
ordered to register their family members' names and relocate to major
cities in Europe. They are forcibly pushed into an area of only sixteen
square blocks, called as ghettos.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Czech-born businessman and member of
Nazi party, finds the war a suitable opportunity to make money.
Schindler, the womanizer, appoints a Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern
(Ben Kingsley), and assigns him to recruit the Jews, including
beautiful women. <br /><br />Schindler's metal factory is the haven for the thousands of Jews to
escape from the merciless Nazis. He slowly changes his attitude towards
Jews and even persuades ruthless Nazi officer Amon Goeth (Ralph
Fiennes) to show his humane face. At a time, when the fierce battle is
ravaging Europe, Schindler make his list of Jews to transport them to
his hometown. Schindler risks his life and goes bankrupt to save more
than 1,000 Jews from certain death in concentration camps. Today, more
than six thousand descendants of the Schindler's Jews are living in
different parts of the world with his memory. <br /><br />Nominated for 12 categories, Schindler's List won 7 Oscars.<br /><br />Thomas Keneally's novel 'Schindler's Ark' is based on interviews with
50 Schindler survivors as well as other written testimonies and
sources. To gather costumes for 20,000 extras, the costume designer
took out advertisements seeking clothes. When permission denied to
shoot the death camp inside Auschwitz, a mirror-image set was created
outside the real location. The highly acclaimed, touching drama is the
only movie from 90's ranked in American Film Institute's top ten list.
Spielberg called Schindler's List 'the most satisfying experience of
his career.' Steven Spielberg's emotionally packed melodrama drenches
us in tears with its realistic creation of sorrowful Holocaust days.
