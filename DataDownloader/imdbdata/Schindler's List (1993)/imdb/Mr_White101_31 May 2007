&quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; (1994)<br /><br />Schindler&#39;s List is an Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Grammy
winning 1993 movie based on the book Schindler&#39;s Ark by Thomas
Keneally. Adapted by Steven Zaillian and directed by Steven Spielberg,
it relates the tale of Oskar Schindler, a Sudeten-German Catholic
businessman who was instrumental in saving the lives of over one
thousand Polish Jews during the Holocaust. The title refers to a list
of the names of 1,100 Jews whom Schindler hired to work in his factory
and kept from being sent to concentration camps, and falling victim to
Nazi officer Amon G&ouml;th, a sociopath who perceives Jews as &#39;&#39;vermin&#39;&#39;.<br /><br />Whilst Steven Spielberg&#39;s breathtakingly superb masterwork Schindler&#39;s
List contains a vast amount of stunning shots, the one that sticks in
my mind the most is found about half the way through the picture, an
image of Amon G&ouml;th and Oskar Schindler sitting atop a balcony over
G&ouml;th&#39;s concentration camp. The shot captures the most prolific of
contrasts contained in the film. Firstly, a man so sadistic we
instinctively see him as a human embodiment of &#39;evil&#39;. Then on the
other side of the frame is a man caught between two extremes, gradually
discovering who he is and the power of the individual. Usually of
course, we don&#39;t have such roles, just simply &#39;the good&#39; and &#39;the bad&#39;.
Although this is not this case here, as we are given characters built
up imaginatively and yet realistically and as a result remain
incredibly deep and complex personas throughout. The majestic depiction
of power in this image is so significant that the viewer can sense the
stench of sovereignty coming off these people- but the mastery of the
two men differ drastically. We have one who relishes in the rewards of
his immorality and the scale of his power and influence. And then we
have our protagonist, if you can call him that at this point in the
film, at war with his own conscience, giving us the centrepiece and
motivation for one of the most exquisitely told tales in the history of
cinema. A superb piece, which presents massacres as real events, not
figures, and portrays a complete moral transition subtly and
believably, as opposed to clich&eacute; smiles and corny montages. <br /><br />Schindler&#39;s List works primarily on obvious aspects; it&#39;s ability to
capture the Holocaust on a grand, monumental scale, it&#39;s glorious
character study and it&#39;s staggering cinematography. But this you all
know, or can decipher within your first viewing. This isn&#39;t to say
these traits aren&#39;t spectacular, but we find several examples of
greatness, such as the passionate directorial effort, the historical
accuracy, the career-highlighting performances, the light- hearted
comedic moments, the Schindler/Stern relationship and the film&#39;s
emotionally stirring closing sequence, to name a few. At one point we
are shown the interior of a Krak&oacute;w church, which artistically
transcends beauty- and yet, within seconds, we are shown the shady
deals of crooks and hustlers in the rows of seats below, contrasting
wonderfully. Another example is present in a a foggy shot of the Jewish
ghettos, a visually stunning image, contrasted immediately by gunshots
and killings. It is as if the literal contradictions mirror Schindler&#39;s
moral conflict.<br /><br />Schindler&#39;s character is, in a sense, the centre and heart of the
movie. He is an example of good will, hope and ultimately help in a
helpless situation. Despite this, Schindler is a womaniser, a gambler,
greedy and out for himself- he isn&#39;t a leader, an idol or a superhero.
He is a businessman. Midway through, a spot of colour is dashed onto
the pallet, as a young girl sports a red coat, standing out
immaculately over the black and white background. Does this mark
Schindler&#39;s change of heart, his transcend to goodness, his epiphany?
Of course not, such an occurrence wouldn&#39;t generate a total change of
belief so suddenly. The image marks a realisation Schindler has about
the horrors going on around him, perhaps even tapping into his
conscience, but it is much later in the film that he actually acts on
this in total selflessness. The motivation behind Schindler&#39;s decision
is gradual, he is not a hero, nor does he wish to glorify his position
as a saviour. He just truly wishes to help people, something portrayed
in total realism, making it even more heart-warming. Such a pure
character development creates not just a good film, but a powerful
example of cinematic brilliance.<br /><br />The film is shown on an epic scale, and admirably remains intimate and
touching simultaneously. It is beautiful yet harrowing, heart-warming
yet heart-wrenching, inspiring yet dismaying and all the way through
displaying excellence. Schindler&#39;s List is undoubtedly a contemporary
classic, and rightly so. It&#39;s ability to take us into the heart of
darkness and capture the essence of hope is simply breathtaking.
Whether granting lives or taking them away, brilliance is present in
every shot. 10/10
