Steven Spielberg have made movie masterpieces left and right. His movie
classics include &quot;E.T.&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Close
Encounter's of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, and
&quot;The Color Purple&quot;. I love all of those films. However, &quot;Schindler's List&quot;
is his #1 masterpiece. The movie that would finally win him the Best
Director Oscar after losing and being snubbed by the Academy for years,
&quot;Schindler's List&quot; takes place during the Holocaust and tells the story of
Oscar Schindler, the real-life German war profiteer who saved the lives of
more than 1,000 Polish Jews. This is one of the most powerful movies ever
made, lasting over 3 hours long and shot in beautiful black-and-white.
Winner of 7 Academy Awards (including Best Picture), &quot;Schindler's List&quot;
features spectacular performances by Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler, Ben
Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant, and Ralph Fiennes in one of the
scariest movie performances of all time as an evil Nazi commandant. A
harrowing, powerful film that will live on forever, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is an
outstanding movie that I'll never forget.<br /><br />**** (out of four)
