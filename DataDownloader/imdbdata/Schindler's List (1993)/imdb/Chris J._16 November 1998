Spielberg's masterpiece.  Even the framing device which some did not like
worked well for me.
The girl in the red dress may have been an obvious film
device
but it worked extremely well.
It wasn't a controversial film in any sense, but it is
nearly
perfect.<br /><br />I think Ben Kingsley quiet performance is some of the most subtle and
brilliant acting I have ever seen.
Neeson and Fiennes have been lauded many times and so should
Kingsley.<br /><br />
