It is official. Stephen Spielberg is a G-E-N-I-U-S! Schindler&#39;s List is
definitely one of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen. And I get around. I
have seen A LOT of great movies. Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is
phenomenal, except for one minor, over-dramatic scene, Ben Kingsley is
(as usual) fantastic, and Ralph Fiennes does a frighteningly good job
of being evil. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white in
order to be consistent with the time period, but there are a few
artistic splashes of color for meaningful, symbolic ideas and images. I
you haven&#39;t seen this amazing movie, bring some tissues and be prepared
for great acting and disturbing images and scenes. It is very moving
and very powerful.
