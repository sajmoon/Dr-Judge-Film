What can you say about this masterpiece of work is WINNER PERFECT
BRILLIANT GENIUS SKILLED and an ARTIST AT WORK. Shindlers list is the
best film ever made, without any doubt. Liam Neeson gives his best
performance ever, along with Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. It depicts
war at its most horrific and eventful stages in the perfect way (it
needs to be shown). Life is full of wars, and to really understand how
bad war gets you must see this piece of art. Steven Spielberg is a
genius, the best at what he does.<br /><br />The way he blends a tiny bit of color (red) into this film is so so
powerful and effective, you can see why he got best DIRECTOR AND BEST
FILM in the Oscars. I believe this film should be watched by everyone
who does not understand the horrors of war........<br /><br />PAUL........
