Schindler's List grips from it's first moments and holds audiences far
beyond the final credits. Spielberg documents Otto Schindler's success in
saving many Jews from the horror of Nazi death camps. More importantly the
film chronicles, in horrific detail, the nightmare that Polish Jews went
through.<br /><br />Thankfully avoiding sentimentality or romanticism Spielberg takes us into
the gettos and camps, dispassionately observing moments of heartbreaking
tragedy, we watch horrified as a young Jewish woman, an architect, is shot
for being right, or as the camp commander 'plays' with the Jewish
prisoners
by shooting them from his balcony.<br /><br />Shot in stark black and white (except for the final ten minutes) the film
convies beautifully the worst and the best of humanity. One exceptional
touch is worth mentioning; as Schindler watches, in black &amp; white, the
Jews
being hearded from the getto, he spots a little girl in a red coat, the
camera follows her until she is swallowed into the teeming crowds. Later
we
see the red coat on a lorry of disgarded clothing, but no little
girl.<br /><br />Spielberg has never been better and no Hollywood film has captured so
accurately the human tragedy of the Hollocaust.
