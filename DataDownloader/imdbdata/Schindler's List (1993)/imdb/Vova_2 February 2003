I have seen this movie yesterday, and I was amazed. I know that this movie
is better than Lord of the Rings; both of them. I have this movie on DVD
and
it is really awesome. This movie is unforgetable, I want to see this movie
again and again. Who agrees with me about Lord of the Rings being over
rated?
