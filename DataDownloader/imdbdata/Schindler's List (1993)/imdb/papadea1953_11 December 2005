If you could call a holocaust movie spectacular, then this would be the
one. The Holocaust was a period in human history that should never have
happened, yet it has become the most reported on in all of human
history. In Schindler's List we see only a small portion of Hitler's
&quot;Final Solution&quot;, the plot to eradicate a segment of humankind from the
face of the earth. We see a businessman who wants to make money out of
war, dealing with a sick Nazi, who only cares about doing his duty,
trying to survive a world war. Eventually we see how the Nazi mentality
takes over the soldier, and how a man finally realizes the inhumanity
of the regime he is serving. The fitting portion of Schindler's
realization is when he holds the &quot;Nazi Party Pin&quot; in his hand and
realizes he could have freed a few more people for that small piece of
gold. This is a movie that all should watch and wonder how each one can
contribute to the humanization of this world of ours.
