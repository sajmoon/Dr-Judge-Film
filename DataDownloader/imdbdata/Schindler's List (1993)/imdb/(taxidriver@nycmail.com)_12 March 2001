Though I cannot entertain the idea that this will be the last time I choose
a favorite film, for right now, this is it. I haven't seen it in a long time
but have been thinking about it a lot. So many scenes that have an
incredible impact on myself. And the great thing about this film is that it
doesn't hit me personally... I am not Jewish, not that it can't even if you
are or aren't, but it does hit me on another, greater scale. The film itself
is perhaps one of the best crafted, if not the best, and really, I haven't
witnessed one flaw. And despite what the film is about I could watch it over
and over again... and be in awe every time. There is a true magic about this
film that I haven't seen in any other. I love this movie. Also, this is my
last review for I feel I am in no place to judge the work of film makers,
whether in my opinion I hold their work in high regard of low. Cinema is the
greatest art form and something so magical and loveable.<br /><br />
