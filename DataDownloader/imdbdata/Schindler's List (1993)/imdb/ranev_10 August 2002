There are many things I admire about this film. Spielberg is certainly one
of the few Hollywood directors with European sensibilities; on some
occasions during the film one is reminded of the works of black and white
greats Ingmar Bergman (The Seventh Seal) and Andrzej Wajda (Ashes and
Diamonds). However, I think that the problem with both of Spielberg's WWII
movies is that the boy from Cincinnati never actually lived through the war
(he was born a year after its completion) so while he may be able capture
its goriness to last splattered fragment of human skull he never captures
its horror. As it is, many of the supposedly dreadful sequences of Nazi
brutality play more like smut than anything else. Also, the silly and rather
racist Anglo-German, Anglo-Polish and Anglo-Russian accents were distracting
and completely ruined the film's authenticity. Spielberg should have hired
an international cast and used subtitles but, then again, he probably
wouldn't have made as much money. Which brings me to this say that the only
thing that prevents Spielberg from making &quot;The Great American Movie&quot; is that
he is a crowd-pleasing blatant sentimentalist. Notice the simplistic ending
that scores easy points for Schindler. Finally, it would have been courteous
to the other 7 million non-Jewish victims who perished in the Concentration
camps if Spielberg had at least acknowledged their existence.
