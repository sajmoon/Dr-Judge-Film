The problems with Schindler&#39;s List starts with the title. As was
finally pointed out to the world in 2004 by David Crowe in _Oskar
Schindler: The Untold Account of his Life, Wartime Activities and the
True Story behind the List_, Schindler never compiled a list of
necessary workers who needed to be, at all costs, saved from the Nazi&#39;s
mechanisms of genocide.<br /><br />In fact, Schindler was simply a man who managed to make his name as a
humanitarian while becoming exceedingly wealthy off the backs of his
legions of Jewish slave laborers. Had I just beamed down to earth,
never having heard of Schindler, his non-existent eponymous list, nor
the Spielberg schmaltz-fest, I would never be brought to believe it.
But there you have it. In a reversal which ranks right up there with
Kissinger being awarded half of the Nobel Peace Prize, a man whose
claim to humanitarian distinction was running a mechanized slave labor
camp is lionized in this mawkish film.<br /><br />In fact, Spielberg never misses a chance to stoke our admiration for
Schindler by contrasting him with hordes of screaming Germans twisted
with rage. In this context, Schindler shines out as a doggedly
entrepreneurial Nazi whose indifference to the existence of Jews,
combined with specific exploitative and harmful acts against specific
Jews, means that he&#39;s not really a Nazi at all! It may be a stark
absurdity, but that&#39;s how we&#39;re supposed to accept Spielberg&#39;s
Schindler.<br /><br />Schindler, you see, is a different kind of Nazi (or at least a
different kind of Nazi in the context of this film). Spielberg&#39;s
Schindler sets up shop in a &#39;Poland&#39; which is entirely devoid of its
majority of actual inhabitants: gentile Poles. Not for Spielberg the
complexities of portraying the gassed anarchists, Communists, union
leaders, homosexuals, gypsies, handicapped, etc. Instead, we are
treated to a movie where there are two main characters, both German,
and an assorted cast of thousands divided solely between German Nazis
and Jews, a point of view which is reflected, historically, in the Nazi
propaganda of the era. After all, if the place is culturally German,
but just overrun with Jews, then by the depraved &#39;logic&#39; of the
Holocaust it is perfectly permissible to march in and take it back from
the Jewish usurpers. Any Poles that exist are only there to yell and
cheer and say &quot;Goodbye Jews!&quot; as the Jews are loaded onto cattle trains
embarked to Auschwitz. Apparently none of them ever thought twice about
the actual usurpers, the Nazis, stomping around their land in
jackboots.<br /><br />It is in the distinction between the crowd and Schindler that the
film&#39;s appreciation for Schindler grows. And why? The crowd is loud,
hectoring, and probably stinking. They represent the worst excesses of
the masses, and demand Jewish deaths to slake their bloodlust. They
want to hurt Jews without a valid reason; there is no profit, only for
the personal (vicarous) pleasure they may take in their deaths.
Schindler is only willing to hurt Jews in the pursuit of profit, an
eminently sensible arrangement in a noble, logical fascist scheme for
which Spielberg deploys every clich&eacute;d trick to mug the viewer of his
emotions the way that some will mug a person to get at his wallet.<br /><br />So there you have Schindler&#39;s List in a nutshell: we welcome our new
slave labor overlords.
