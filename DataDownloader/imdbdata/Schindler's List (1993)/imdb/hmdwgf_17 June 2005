This film does not have one error in anything in it: This film is
absolutely brilliant in any standard, it is flawless, perfectly
executed, shocking (REALLY SHOCKING), extremely violent (the many
scenes of Jews being executed are definitely the most graphically
realistic, totally believable brutal killings ever put on film, AND I
MEAN THAT.) and extremely intense, in every sense of the word. This
film does not have a false note in it's execution scenes, storytelling
or acting. And this film is so moving (especially for Jews) and so
engrossing that it felt like this whole film was really happening
around me when I watched it (and I was dead scared, don't get me wrong)
There is no way anybody will be offended by this film. The last great,
unforgettable, internationally critically acclaimed 5-star and classic
film of the ages. And it is all based on a true story.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is extraordinary as Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi
party who saves the lives of 1,100 Jews by employing them to work in
his factory. Ben Kingsley is compelling as Schindler's Jewish
accountant (and WHY wasn't he at least nominated?) and Ralph Fiennes is
terrifying as the foul-mouthed Nazi Commandant. Both Neeson and Fiennes
were nominated (they should have both won) Neeson for Best Actor, and
Fiennes for Supporting Actor.
