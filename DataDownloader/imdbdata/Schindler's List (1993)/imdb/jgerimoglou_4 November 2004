The film is brilliant. Many times tried not to cry thinking that how
people like Jews, people who had so many difficulties and casualties,
act now like Germans did , with the Paleastines. Didn't history teach a
lesson? Unbelievable piece of movie! The director (who is my favourite)
gave real lessons of how an anti-war movie should be shot. The
photography was amazing and I strongly recommend anyone who has not
seen this movie, to go and see it asap. The musical score is one of the
best ever heard (J.Williams is one of my favourites as well). Finally,
the last scene with the real survirors from the list accompanied by the
actors was one of the most intensed scenes I have ever watched. Go and
see it!
