Spielberg tends to get a bit overly cheesy in his films and this one is
a prime example. Obviously the subject matter is intense and there are
a lot of good qualities to the film but the ending was the part that
really wrecked it for me and made me roll my eyes back in my head.
Another example of an overly cheesed out ending that wrecked an
otherwise great film was in Spielberg&#39;s 2001 film AI. I thought that
was an excellent movie all the way up to the end when it just kept
dragging on and on and got totally ridiculous. I don&#39;t think the ending
on Schindler&#39;s List as bad as AI but it was still too much icing and
not enough cake.
