Great movie that really touches one&#39;s hart. If you&#39;re not moved by this
film, you are most likely made out of rock. (Please note the jokingly
tone in that sentence:) It&#39;s not the script or the theme that carries
this movie forward, it&#39;s the brilliant performance of the
actors/actresses and the unique atmosphere in the black and white world
on the screen that rips your heart out and steps on it. The glances,
the body language, the tension between the actors... I can&#39;t point out
exactly what it is with these things that give the movie such
credibility, I can only say that it -d-o-e-s. A black and white movie
about the Nazi-regime might sound boring, or a bit over the top in
being serious and dealing with an important issue, but in this case the
director did a great job. It&#39;s not boring. It doesn&#39;t seem like a
documentary, like many films about these events does. Still, knowing
that the plot is based on a real story really makes you feel like this
film is reality. And that, ladies and gents, is definitely a good
thing. Ten out of ten stars from me.
