This movie was a poor effort. The theme is quite interesting, but it was
presented in a very tedious way. Neeson gave a quite good performance, but
apart from that, the movie was uninspiring. Of course with such comments the
politically correct will claim that I was not mature enough, that I did not
understand the movie etc. This is quite common with movies made by a
prestigious director, with a sensitive theme, emotional screenplay etc.
Giving negative critics to Schindler's List is almost regarded as
disrespecting the events of WWII. This is not the case however. It was just
a wearisome movie.
