&quot;Schindler's List&quot; begins in September of 1939 at the start of WWII.
Oskar
Schindler (Liam Neeson) opens a factory at the beginning of the movie and
needs Jews to work in it for free.  Although he doesn't pay his workers
with
cash, they receive something more valuable in the end--their freedom and
their lives.  In the beginning, Schindler is only out to make money, but
by
the end of the movie, has given up everything to help save the lives of
over
1,100 Jewish people.<br /><br />Spielberg is trying to tell Schindler's true story so more people will
know
the truth about him and his contributions to help the Jews.  Schindler
isn't
made out to be a saint, however, as he loves women and mingles with the
Nazis.  Spielberg also wants to show how one man can make such a
difference
in the world.  Although Schindler feels he could have spared more lives,
Spielberg illustrates that countless generations live because of his
concern
and generosity.<br /><br />The black and white film gives the movie more authenticity and realism.
The
little color used was utilized very effectively.  At times the film is
hard
to watch, as it is gory, vulgar, and contains nudity, but much of it is
needed for the full effect of the film.  After seeing scenes that depict
how
the Jews were treated in the ghettos and death camps, we have some
understanding of what they lived through.  Spielberg pieced the elements
together to make the movie as close to actuality as possible.  It is an
informative and heartbreaking story that is very well put
together.
