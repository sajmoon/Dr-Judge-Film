I personally believe that this is the best movie of all times.  It was so
touching, I still cry on the end scene even though I have seen it at least
twenty times.  Liam Neeson gave such a beautiful performance, I actually
felt that he was Oskar Schindler.  No one in this world that has a soul
could insult his art of acting.  I saw that movie when after I had read the
book.  I was thoroughly impressed with Steven Spielberg's producing, and his
directing was perfect. Everyone looked as though they belonged on the
set.<br /><br />E-mail me and tell me your thoughts..........Thank you.<br /><br />Rachael Sayward Simmons
