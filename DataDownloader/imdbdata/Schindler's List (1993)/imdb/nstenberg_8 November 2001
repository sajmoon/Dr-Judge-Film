Seen from a humanistic point of view, Schindler's List is indeed a goog
movie. However, if we have to view it from a filmic point of view, the
movie
isn't that good.<br /><br />You see the movie suffers from the classic &quot;Steven Spielberg Syndrom&quot;. You
&quot;see&quot; the movie but you don't &quot;feel&quot; it! In the end it is superficial and
insignificant. Even though Spielberg has doen his best to make it a good
film, it isn't. That's sad, since the content is so important.
