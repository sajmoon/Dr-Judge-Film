Life goes on despite carnage and war! that is the overriding theme of
the movie.During one of the darkest hour of human history despite
brutality and holocaust ,a radiance of hope emerges from one of the
least likely member of the human tribe.<br /><br />That is reassuring!! <br /><br />Spielberg masters his craft well to restore our faith in humanity.The
black &amp; white picture adds a sense of stark realism, authenticating the
plot.The story of the German businessman Schindler is well known so its
futile to repeat.His transformation from a war-profiteer to a saviour
is miraculous yet heart-warming.Liam Neeson gives a memorable
performance as Schindler.So does the brilliant Ben Kingsley as Ithzak
Stern.Who can say that this man was so convincing as Gandhi just few
years ago? Ralph Fiennes too delivers as the sadistic yet shrewd
villain Amon Goeth and so does the other side-actors.Indeed the subtle
diplomacy between Schindler and Goeth is one of the stand points of the
film.<br /><br />Dedication can be sensed in every frame of the movie right from the
camera work to the background score.It seems the crew members realized
the importance of history they were re-creating.The script is taut and
does not drag despite the over 3 hrs length of the film.The scene with
the little girl in red dress(only color frame in the movie) involves
the audience with its underlying innocence.From there on Schindler's
transformation affects us too as we realize the enormity of the journey
he embarks upon.Beyond the macabre mass murders and &quot;killings for fun&quot;
we start to share the collective joy and grief of the struggling
community-that sense of togetherness lingers on far after the film
ends.That is the biggest reward from the film.<br /><br />Today there are few thousand Jews left in whole Poland while
Schindler's Jews alone have grown beyond 10000.<br /><br />Whosoever saves one life,saves the world entire.<br /><br />Who said we cannot make a difference?
