One of the finest productions ever put on film; also one of the most
difficult films to watch that you will ever experience.<br /><br />It pulls no punches; therefore, it conveys just what a horrifying evil
World War II&#x27;s Nazi Germany really was. The reality of just what hatred
and bigotry can influence one person to do to another is shown as ugly
as it really is, and it&#x27;s truly painful to see. The atrocities of this
perverse dictatorship could easily be dismissed as a fluke of a violent
era, but this film&#x27;s underlying theme warns it could happen again.<br /><br />Spielberg outdid himself in this brilliant work. The hopelessness that
must have been experienced by the victims of this vile time are
captured so well on every level. The acting is superb: the psychotic
Nazi colonel was a standout. Liam Neeson is memorable as the guilt
ridden German businessman Schindler who endeavors to rescue political
prisoners right out from under the Nazis&#x27; noses. The many Jewish people
targeted and viciously abused in concentration camps are ably portrayed
by the cast with strong conviction.<br /><br />Explicit scenes of ruthless killing and other abhorrent violence are
not withheld, and this film is a rare case where such brutal honesty is
appropriate and effective. There were scenes where I had to look away;
I could almost feel the kick, the punch, the spit, the bullet. It was
painful empathy for the terror of those in peril, and witnessing the
many disgusting indignities they endured.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a guarantee this is not a pleasant watch; some of the imagery may
horrify you, especially with the realization that these things depicted
actually took place. You will see the lowest and most detestable
behavior by people imaginable, and it will stick with you. However, it
is a necessary precautionary message. This was Spielberg&#x27;s finest hour.
