A worthy, well-made film but not as good as Jaws. This is the darkest
subject imaginable and Spielberg put in too much Hollywood optimism in the
second half. Everyone wanted to like it when it came out but it will be
remembered more for its illumination of the historical record than as a
great movie. Its rating will fall quite rapidly over the next ten years.
