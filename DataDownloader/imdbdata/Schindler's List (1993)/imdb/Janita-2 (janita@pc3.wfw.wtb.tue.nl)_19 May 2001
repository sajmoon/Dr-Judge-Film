Since I was about eight years old, we got taught the history of the second
world war in school and the holocaust was handeled with special care.
Nevertheless, only after I saw Schindler's list, the fact that this really
happened got through to me and I started realising the whole thing. It
really impressed me (but I have to admit I had trouble staying awake at
first because they started the broadcasting at about 11.15 PM and as we all
know it lasts for over three hours) and I went trough a lot of trouble
trying to get the video. 
But enough about that. It's my favourite (next to interview with the
vampire) and Liam Neeson gained himself a place on my favourite actors list
(including Al Pachino and Kevin Spacey). Too bad he didn't win the oscar;
he's a great actor (sometimes he just makes the wrong movies).  I thoink the
black and white adds an extra dimension to the film; allthough I never would
have recognised the read-coated girl whitout the sudden
coulour-adding.
Alltogheter, it's for as far as I've seen, the best Historical movie
sofar.
