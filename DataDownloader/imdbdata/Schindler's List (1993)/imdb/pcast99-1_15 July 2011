Before I watched this movie I had heard a lot of great things about
this movie, that it&#x27;s Spielberg&#x27;s best and one of the greatest movies
ever made. And I have to say when I finally watched it, this was the
only movie I knew immediately after that it was a pure masterpiece of
film making. I knew this was a movie about the Holocaust, but I didn&#x27;t
know who Oscar Schindler was, so I had to do some research and saw he
saved over a thousand Jews from Auschwitz. The movie started out a
little slow, but It focused on different characters to build up depth
and development. About an hour in I was so captivated by the realism
and accuracy I couldn&#x27;t look away even though it is very graphic and
violent. The scenes in the prison camp were spot on, and each actor in
this movie gave a flawless performance. Liam Neeson was perfect in the
role as Schindler, and Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes were great as
well. I&#x27;ll end by saying this movie will open your eyes to the horrors
of what happened in the Holocaust, but it will also give you a sense of
hope.
