This movie is proof that Steven Spielberg is the best director of all
time. While i was watching this movie i was crying my eyes out and not
just because of the greatness but because i realized that i will never
be able to begin to understand how incredible this movie is, but from
the stuff that i did understand was how great the meaning is and how it
still gives hope to man kind. This movie truly is the best war film of
all time. This film just might even change the way you look at life. If
this film dose not impact you in any way then watch it again or go to
film school because you are blind or just take a look back on some of
his other great movies. Such as E.T. Thank you Steven you truly are my
inspiration and my hero.
