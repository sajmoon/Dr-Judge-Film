After every time I watch Schindler's List, I always ask myself how did Ralph
Fiennes not win a best supporting actor Oscar for his work in this movie?
His performance in this movie was superb.<br /><br />Everything about this film is right on the money (okay, okay, Liam Neeson's
thing at the end, &quot;...this pin could have saved 3 people... this limousine
10 people...&quot; was a little over the top [maybe]). The first time I saw
Schindler's was in 1993 in Manhattan, I was moved to tears. Afterwards a
woman (who I had never met before) sitting next to me who looked to be in
her 60s reached over the armrest, embraced me and then kissed me on the
cheek. She then said, &quot;thank you,&quot; and left. Was she or a member of her
family a holocaust survivor?  I'll never know but it was great to see a
movie have such an effect on its audience. I highly recommend this movie and
also to those who have seen it already I recommend a visit to the national
Holocaust museum in Washington DC. If you thought Schindler's List was
amazing, a trip to the museum really emphasizes the scale and magnitude of
this act of evil.
