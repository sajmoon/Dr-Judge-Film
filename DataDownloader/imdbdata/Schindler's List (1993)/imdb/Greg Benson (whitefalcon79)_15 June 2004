My significant other brought home Schindler's List on DVD the other
day. I'd never seen it. I'd wanted to see it during its time at the box
office, but never got around to it. I thought, after eleven years, it
was about time I did.<br /><br />I'll be brief. I was a little underwhelmed. Perhaps I'd forgotten for a
moment that it was a Spielberg film and not a war documentary. Perhaps
I've seen too many war movies since its 1993 release that I expected
something a little more graphic than it was (bear in mind it was
branded one of THE most graphic films of all time eleven years ago).
Perhaps I'm desensitized to it all...<br /><br />Yes, I think this is a film that everyone SHOULD see... if for no
reason other than to be able to say, &quot;Schindler's List? Yes, I've seen
it. Wasn't it... (insert your own interpretation here)?&quot; And believe
me, the way you see it will be different to how others have seen it and
will see it in future.<br /><br />I'll leave the question of its historical accuracy to the historians.
All I know was that I found Schindler's List, by and large, a bit
tedious and a little anti-climactic, having built myself up over a
decade for the &quot;experience&quot;.<br /><br />I was fourteen years old in 1993. Perhaps I should have seen it then.
It might have impacted me differently (and a lot more strongly) to how
little it impacted me in 2004.
