Schindler&#x27;s List was the first film by Steven Spielberg since Jaws I
can genuinely call a masterpiece. Schindler&#x27;s List is the highlight of
the 90&#x27;s, a touching look into humanism and a frightening look into the
Holocaust. Filmed in Black and white (a very good decision from
Spielberg) and as grand as Hollywood&#x27;s most classic works, Schindler&#x27;s
List claims itself at the top of 90&#x27;s filmmaking. All three leads are
magnificent, especially Fiennes in his most well acted role yet. The
depiction of the concentration camps is raw and gritty, not glazed over
and stylized. A triumph for Steven Spielberg and the cast and crew. It
is certainly the most impressive Spielberg film and perhaps the best
film of the 1990&#x27;s.
