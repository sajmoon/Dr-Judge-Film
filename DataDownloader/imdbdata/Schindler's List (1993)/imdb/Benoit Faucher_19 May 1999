This movie, which at first I was reluctant to see turned out to be a
revelation for me.  I was absolutely shocked by the horrific pictures
Steven
Spielberg wove throughout the film.  This movie had me crying (and I don't
cry for much) from the beginning to the end and if you have one ounce of
sensibility you will too.  This movie not only informs you, but it also
shocks you and makes you think about yourself and the whole human race in
general.  What makes me sad is that there are people who didn't like it or
even detested it; these people, I believe should watch it again to grasp
the
importance of this film.  This, I beleive is the greatest movie of all
time.
