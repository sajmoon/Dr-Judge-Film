Prior to making Schindler&#39;s List, Steven Spielberg was known for Close
Ecounters, E.T. and the Indiana Jones films - not exactly the kind of
resum&eacute; studios would trust when searching for the ideal guy to direct a
Holocaust drama. Then again, Scorsese passed on the project because he
felt only a Jewish filmmaker could get it right (plus, he was still
recovering from the controversy surrounding The Last Temptation of
Christ), Billy Wilder said he was too old (but he did contribute to a
first draft of the screenplay) and Roman Polanski stated he just wasn&#39;t
ready to face his childhood nightmares yet (he did nine years later
with The Pianist). Spielberg received a lot of criticism before the
film was released, purely because of his back catalogue. Of course, it
is now a fact he proved everyone wrong with what can be considered the
best, most affecting of his serious movies.<br /><br />Based on Thomas Keneally&#39;s bestseller (deftly adapted by Steven
Zaillian), the film tells one of the most amazing true stories of our
time, one that stands out as a testament to courage and selflessness in
a time as brutal and inhuman as World War II. The story is that of
Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who first came
across the &quot;Jewish situation&quot; in Hitler&#39;s Germany when he decided to
employ Jews in his factory in order to save money. He wasn&#39;t an
outspoken anti-Semite, nor did he oppose the Nazi regime - to him, it
was all about business. Case in point: when he first meets his new
assistant (Ben Kingsley) and the latter says he&#39;s a Jew, Schindler&#39;s
matter-of-fact answer is: &quot;And I&#39;m a German.&quot;.<br /><br />The famous list doesn&#39;t enter the game until much later, when the
cynical businessman witnesses the horrors perpetrated by the SS,
particularly the stunningly cruel Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), and
decides to use all his power and influence to save as many innocent
lives as possible. His actions, which could have cost him his life had
he been discovered, will go down in history as one of the most
extraordinary events of all time.<br /><br />If told the wrong way, Schindler&#39;s story would have ruined Spielberg&#39;s
career. Luckily, the director made the wisest choice possible, opting
for a documentary-like approach to the material: the film is shot in
grainy black-and-white, as if it were a newsreel from that period, and
the realism is most evident in the concentration camp scenes -
Spielberg doesn&#39;t linger on the violence or sanitize it, he just shows
it exactly as it was. The one element in color in the whole picture (a
girl&#39;s red dress, reminiscent of Nicolas Roeg&#39;s Don&#39;t Look Now) isn&#39;t a
concession to the somewhat cheesy sentimentality that is occasionally
present in Spielberg&#39;s filmography, but a tool to highlight the tragedy
of it all. The sobriety of the direction is reflected in every other
aspect of the picture, most notably John Williams&#39; Oscar-winning score
and the three main performances: Kingsley&#39;s talent was never in doubt
after Gandhi, and Neeson and Fiennes will probably never do better than
here (although both have managed to get pretty close, thankfully).<br /><br />This painfully real film is a precious means to remember the past and
think thoroughly about one of the worst things that ever happened to
people, an atrocity mankind hopefully won&#39;t repeat, not even in a
thousand years. It&#39;s a look on the past that serves as a warning for
the future, and as such, its power will never diminish.
