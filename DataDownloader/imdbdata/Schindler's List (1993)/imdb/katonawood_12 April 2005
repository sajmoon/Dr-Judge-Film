This movie fails miserably to tell a decent story. In typical Spielberg
fashion, the movie blatantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by
relying on long camera shots holding on blatantly emotional moments,
using &quot;too cute&quot; actors to elicit complete empathy and to push
everything over the edge -- sappy music to punctuate the scene. I felt
after what I could watch of this movie (I couldn't stomach a full
viewing) that I was manipulated and coerced into my emotions about the
content of the film. This movie is one of the least intelligent
meant-to-be-intelligent movies. Insulting. One should view &quot;The
Pianist&quot; for about as perfect a movie re-enacting a Holocaust
experience. Not once do you feel as though your being 'forced' to
empathize or sympathize with the character, that happens naturally in
the context of the film. Any person of Jewish faith should be
embarrassed and ashamed of this movie; it actually does a dis-service
to the Holocaust. I think it's best summed up by an episode of
Sienfield -- sleep worthy!
