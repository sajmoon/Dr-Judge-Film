i was very optomistic about renting shindlers list. i know this is a late
review and i always make my reviews short and sweet but i finnaly got the
guts to rent shindlers list and i must say that this is and will be my all
time favorite movie. the acting was so good that it was almost as watching
a
documentary. i said &quot;got the guts&quot; before because the horrors of ww2 and
the
images i ussualy avoid either watching the history channel or anything to
do
with the hollucost. i am the kind of person that cannot view things such
as
piles of dead bodies without having a image burned in my memory. after
watching saving private ryan and the hbo series band of brothers i was a
little dissapointed that these movies,programs didnt show the german side
of
the war. shindlers list did this and more. it showed people being human
and
inhuman, it showed that money does speak for everything and most of all it
showed a german(shindler) who cared about people and did something to save
lives. being of german desent i have been called a natzi my father (who
fought for the united states) was treated like dirt when he got back from
the war. i am so glad that spielberg picked up on this one and told
another
side of germany and that is we are all humans and what hitler did was
insane
but not ALL germans believed him or wanted anything to do with his
rhetoric.
so many of my people from my fathers side were killed during ww2. i lost 4
uncles and countless family that still lived in the fatherland. one of my
uncle's wrote a letter to his mother that i will quote something he said&quot;
we
are soldiers first my dear mother and gentlemen last, there are no
gentlemen
on the battlefield my dear mother and i will be a soldier in their eyes&quot;.i
never really understood what he meant by this untill i saw shindlers list
and now i know.
