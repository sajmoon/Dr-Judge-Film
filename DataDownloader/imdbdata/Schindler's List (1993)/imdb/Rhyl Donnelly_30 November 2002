This is what filmmaking is all about.  Telling brilliant stories that
keep the audience interested.  Visually, the film is excellent, black &amp;
white can reveal so much more. B&amp;W may seem creepy but is definately
needed
for this picture.
Spielberg thought it was necessary to tell this tale, and he was
right.
Some scenes within this film are terrible, but only beacause of their
brutal realism.  It's hard to believe that something like this actually
happened.
If my comments here seem to be negative, they're not.  I still give
this movie a strong 10 out of 10.
