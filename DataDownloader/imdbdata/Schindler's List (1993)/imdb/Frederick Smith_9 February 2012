This amazing story is, in my humble opinion, the epitome of Spielberg&#x27;s
work. To bring a story like this to the screen is nothing short of
magnificent. It would be difficult to single out a particular actor for
their contributions, since the film is so cohesive and unified. You are
immediately drawn into the action, you are watching the events unfold
as if you were there. Liam Neeson&#x27;s performance as Schindler is dynamic
and compelling. At first he appears the opportunist and war profiteer,
but his growth through the film lets you feel his compassion. Ben
Kingsley&#x27;s quiet and steady demeanor throughout the film compliments
Neeson&#x27;s. Ralph Fiennes is the quintessential Nazi camp commandant,
unhappy to be where he is, ruthless in his orders, and totally without
compassion. He is a soulless man who cannot feel love or hate, simply
disdain for the Jews, as if they were cattle. There are so many scenes
in this film that speak to your soul, but perhaps the most important
line in the film occurs near the end. &#x22;If you save one life, in time
you save the world.&#x22; The violence and cruelty of the film make it
unsuitable for those under 14, and between 14 and 17, I would use sound
judgment. A definite collectors item, and if they haven&#x27;t shown this to
your teens in high school, they ought to. This is a reminder of the
inhumanity man can reach if he has nothing to stop him.
