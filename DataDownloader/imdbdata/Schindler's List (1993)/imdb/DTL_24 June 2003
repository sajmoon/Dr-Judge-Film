I saw this film originally in 1993 and have just recently watched the video.
I did not truly appreciate the brilliance of this film ten years ago. If you
have seen THE PIANIST which was a marvelous epic struggle of a single
individual, take a look at this film about the struggle of 800 which is
truly Spielberg's most amazing work.<br /><br />The most incredible fact is that there are less than 4000 Jews remaining in
Poland today, while there are 6000 decendents of those whom Schindler
managed to save.<br /><br />This film will insure that we never forget him or what he did in the name of
humanity. It simply must be transfered to DVD as soon as
possible.<br /><br />
