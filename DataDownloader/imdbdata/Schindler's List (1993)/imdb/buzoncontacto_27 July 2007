It is quite an intriguing thing how people react to this movie, judging
by IMDb comments: either they label it &quot;masterpiece&quot; or &quot;a sappy,
manipulative banalization of the Holocaust&quot;. Either 1 or 10 score. I
can&#39;t understand it. To me, Schindler&#39;s List has both merits and flaws.
It is a technically perfect film, for example. I think no director can
beat Spielberg on that. He is able to film such an overwhelming,
astonishing scene as the Warsaw Ghetto raid and simply...well, simply
make you buy it. He can offer you a conventional scene, like that
Jewish fugitive trying to deceive his Nazi chasers, and provide you a
glimpse of his terror so intense that you can even feel it. No other
director that I am aware of is able to take advantage of modern
technology in a way even remotely close to Spielberg. No one else has
the power to offer us wonders, to leave you speechless, to make the
unbelievable believable. He did it in Schindler&#39;s List, then in Prince
of Egypt, then in Private Ryan (perhaps the most amazing visual
experience in my life). Even Munich shrinks your guts in the shooting
scenes.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Spielberg, though, there is more in movies than
technical ability. The man has a knack for sappiness, for easy morals.
Now come on, a movie about the Holocaust, focusing on the Jews? Yet one
more mouthful of the same porridge that we have been spoon-fed for
decades? And then &quot;La Amistad&quot;, a film intended to teach that slavery
is wrong? Private Ryan, which focuses on how heroic American soldiers
were during WWII, support our troops and honor the vets? Not exactly
controversial matters, I am afraid. To make things worse, Spielberg
doesn&#39;t make the least attempt to blur the simplistic premise. His
Germans are devils, his victims (Jews, black slaves) are pure, noble
and innocent all along and without exception. And critics are right: he
is too sentimental, too sappy. It grows just awkward, in some extreme
cases (I have in mind a couple scenes from Private Ryan, right now).<br /><br />And then there is the annoying (to me, at least) political undertones
of his films. In Schindler&#39;s list, for example, the final scene is very
revealing. The Jews escape the factory and meet a Soviet soldier. &quot;What
can we do&quot; &quot;If I were you, I wouldn&#39;t go East. They don&#39;t like you
there. Neither I would go west&quot;. Next scene: we see all the survivors
in modern Israel. Get it? Israel is the shelter of Jews against the
intolerance of...well, of everyone else, East and West alike. It would
be enough to show that some Jews became traitors and betrayed his ilk,
it would suffice to show that many interns (millions) in the camps were
not Jews, it would make the film much more complex and deeper if we
were offered some hint that, well, camps were run in a good measure by
the interns themselves, the Kapos, who could be as ruthless as the SS.
In fact, we are not even allowed to understand that the 30s and 40s
were a time of strong political commitment and that many of those Jews
were Socialists or Communists, and that they often created support nets
inside the very camps. Does Mr. Spielberg fear we would fail to
sympathized with the victims if we understood that they were
three-dimensional human beings? Does he really regard his viewers THAT
dumb?
