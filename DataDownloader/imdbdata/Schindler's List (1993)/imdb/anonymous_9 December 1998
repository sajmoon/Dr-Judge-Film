When I first hear about this movie, I was scared to see it, because I heard
it was so real and vivid. But when I saw the motion picture, I cried tears
of sadness, and of sympathy. It depicts the truth about the other side of
WWII. The side that some are ignorant enough to deny ever happened. It
teaches us that by doing little, can do so much. The beautiful music, and
graphic depiction of the movie add to the wonderful acting, and harsh
reality that is cast into the audience. Personally, I think this is
Spielberg's best picture, and the one that touches that special place
between your heart and soul, this is one movie everyone should
see.
