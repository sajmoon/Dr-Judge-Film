If you read my comment history, you'll see that it's not often I comment on
&quot;serious&quot; (i.e. non-comedic) films. But I do. I saw this movie as a Year 12
high school text - and was amazed. This is an absolutely incredible film,
touching and shockingly realistic. (The massacre scenes come to mind).  All
in all, I'd say, this is a movie that MUST be watched.
