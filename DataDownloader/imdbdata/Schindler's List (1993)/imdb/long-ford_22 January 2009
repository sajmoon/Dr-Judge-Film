Schindler&#39;s List is a notable achievement for Spielberg. Here he
presents a harrowing account of the horrors suffered by the Jews in
World War II, along with a generally uplifting story of hope. All three
major performances (Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes) are
solid, specially Fiennes, who is impressive as an evil Nazi. The film
is careful to present him as a fully formed character rather than a
caricature. The clearance of the Jews from the Warsaw ghetto is shown
in unsparing detail and without a trace of sentiment. Alas, Spielberg
slips up in the end with a fake-sounding speech from Oskar Schindler
melodramatically lamenting his inability to do more. Still strongly
recommended.<br /><br />Overall 9/10
