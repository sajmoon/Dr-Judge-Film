I cannot imagine how anyone would not like this movie, unless it is for
political reasons.  The three main actors gave the performances of their
careers, which is an amazing feat considering their body of work before
and
after.  Liam Neeson as Schindler undergoes a transformation which was
powerful.  Ben Kingsley's performance was subtle.  Had it been anything
else, the movie would have been diminished.  And Ralph Fiennes was
wonderful
as an evil man who became bored with evil, yet knew no other way to
act.
I am glad Spielberg never won an Oscar until Schindler, the lack of one
may
have spurred him on to this magnificent piece of history.  Lest we forget.
