This film is unquestionably the best film that ever touched the hand of
Spielburg. He has definitely matured as a director, as he shows more
restraint in Schindler's List than he has ever done before. This film proves
that Hollywood can still make a truly thoughtful picture that touches the
hearts of millions. I've must have seen this film over twenty times, and
every single time there are still three scenes in this film that makes me
want to cry. Words simply cannot express the greatness of this film.
Definitely one of the best films ever made.
