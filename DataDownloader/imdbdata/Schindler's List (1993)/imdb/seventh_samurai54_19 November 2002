Schindler's List is the most deeply-moving film ever made. Steven Spielberg
has created a horrifying realistic account of what the Jewish people went
through during WWII. I can't express how much this film moved me
emotionally, so I won't even try. Simply put, it's one of the very best
cinematic experiences you'll ever witness. Brilliant.
