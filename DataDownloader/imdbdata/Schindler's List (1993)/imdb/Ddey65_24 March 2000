 There are two reasons that I didn't like Schindler's List: One was that
even though Oskar Schindler saved the lives of so many Jews, and others that
the Nazis were preparing for the gas chambers, he decided who lived and who
died just like they did. The other reason, is that I personally have an
aversion to movies about the holocaust, because it makes me so mad, that
every time I see it, whether it's from genuine stock footage, or staged for
movie sets, like this one, I feel like barging into the screen like John
Rambo, and shooting every brownshirt in sight, which is the same feeling I
get when I see TV news footage of the more recent Serbian Holocaust against
non-Serbs in the former Yugoslavia. I know that wasn't the point of the
film, but these facts still bother me. <br /><br /> After the world finally learned how bad Nazi Germany was, we all promised
that we'd never let anything like this happen again. Unfortunately, it
already has happened more than several times on six continents, and
continues in some countries to this day.
