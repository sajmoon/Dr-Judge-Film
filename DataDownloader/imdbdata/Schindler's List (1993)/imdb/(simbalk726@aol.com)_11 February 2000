This film is a masterwork, Speilberg's Magnum Opus. His combined use of
effective technical components and brilliant actors creates a moving,
genuinely important film. The actors are wonderful, Liam Neeson in
particular. Every time I see this film I feel like cursing the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for not giving him the Oscar. The main
reason I love this film is that not only is it a work of entertainment, it
is important. I do not usually cry at movies but this one gets me every
time. Everyone should see this film; I guarentee you will not be able to
forget it easily.
