I saw this alone. I arrived right before the film started and found a seat
in the front row. It was so close, I had to tilt my head back to see and
fight a sense of vertigo.<br /><br />After it was over, I just sat there in the theater until they came to
sweep
out the popcorn. This isn't a movie you want to see over and over again,
but
you'll want to see it at least once.<br /><br />The dark, much talked-about cinematography and the Itzhak Perlman's
sublime
violin work are so, so sad. Ralph Fiennes is the very personification of
human evil; Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is an opportunistic war profiteer.
He
doesn't have any grand epiphany or sympathy for the Jews. He just knows
somewhere that he has to help how he can - despite his fear and greed.<br /><br />Like Saving Private Ryan, however, the core of the movie's power is the
documentary-like scenes that bring home the atrocities we've heard about
our
whole lives, but never maybe never FELT like this.
