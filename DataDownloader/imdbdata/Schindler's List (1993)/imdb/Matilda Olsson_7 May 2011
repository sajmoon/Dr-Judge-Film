I first watched Schindler&#x27;s List when I was in the eighth grade and I
remember how my whole class, even the &#x22;tough&#x22; boys just cracked up. The
movie made such an impact on all of us. <br /><br />5 days ago, 5 years later, I saw the movie again and I felt the same
way as last time. You can really feel the pain and the sadness
throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />I love that it&#x27;s shoot in black and white(except from the little girl
in the red jacket) it makes it a thousand times more realistic. Some
people are disturbed by the fact that English is the main language in
the movie, but for me it doesn&#x27;t matter. The story it self is so
breathtaking so you don&#x27;t even have time to reflect that they are
speaking English.<br /><br />Summary: This is a movie everyone should see to really understand the
Nazis impact and extermination of the Jews. You got to be prepared to
be touched and moved. I still think about this movie every day. It&#x27;s
hard to forget. And I can not understand that there&#x27;s people that tries
to deny that it happened.
