Contrary to popular belief, the Malaysian Government did NOT ban the
film. All the Govt wanted was to edit/delete NUDITY scenes in keeping
with the country's strict censorship laws (and laws against public
nudity) which applies to ALL films, not just this one.<br /><br />However Mr Spielberg's petulant &amp; intransigent insistence that the film
be unadulterated (no one censors HIS films, you see) meant that the
film could not be seen at cinemas.<br /><br />Malaysia did however allow the DVD to be rented/purchased hence people
could still see the film in the privacy of their homes. The same policy
applied to Mel Gibson's &quot;The Passion of Christ&quot; where the Government
did NOT ban the film. It simply stipulated tickets be sold strictly at
Christian churches only. Not bad policies &amp; compromises when you
consider that this IS a Muslim country.
