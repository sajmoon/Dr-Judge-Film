There are no words adequate enough in the English language to describe
this fabulous film.<br /><br />John Williams's musical score is just awesome and with Yitzchak Perlman
on the fiddle, what could be better? You are just drawn to the theme of
this highly emotionally unforgettable masterpiece.<br /><br />Liam Neeson has never been better as Oskar Schindler, whose &quot;factory&quot;
saved a thousand Jewish lives during the Holocaust.<br /><br />We see Neeson go through the film as a callous businessman to one of
great feeling when he sees what is happening to the Jews of Poland.<br /><br />This was the first black and white film to capture the best picture
Oscar since 1960's &quot;The Apartment.&quot;<br /><br />Neeson gets tremendous support from Ben Kingsley as his bookkeeper and
an amazingly brilliant performance by Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, the
Nazi mad-dog official. Fiennes portrayal is absolutely frightening as
he steals each scene he is in in this remarkable film.<br /><br />The ending will tear at your heart as those saved place stones on
Jewish graves.<br /><br />A positively memorable Holocaust film with memorable detail depicted.
The liquidation of the ghetto scenes are a haunting memory to what
happened in Nazi occupied Europe.<br /><br />Who can forget the little girl's colored coat as she too becomes a
victim of the Nazi genocide? What effect this scene had!
