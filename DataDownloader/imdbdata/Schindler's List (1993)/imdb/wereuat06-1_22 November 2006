This movie depicts the Jews fight to stay alive and showed what they
really went through. It shows the story of one man who could change
heart with the views of what happened during those years and why it
happened. That will always be a question why. Steven Spielberg hits the
movie rite on the spot and makes you feel as if your there. He brings
it a ll back to life. Everyone gave off amazing performances. This is
Spielberg&#39;s arguably greatest achievement other then Saving Private
Ryan. At the end it makes you feel a little good inside to know what
Oskar Schindler did for the Jews. This movie deserves all the Oscars it
one and more I think this is one of the most amazing story&#39;s ever told
on screen by one of the greatest directors ever to hit the big screen.
I give it a 15 out of 10.
