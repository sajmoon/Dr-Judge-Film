With no doubt this is an excellent movie about love, hate and nearly
all emotions about human nature. i saw this movie 7 times and i always
get stunned and shocked by the performances of all the actors. In my
opinion Liam Neeson could have win the Oscar for this role, he was just
fantastic and this was the first movie i ever watched of this actor and
after watching his other movies , i couldn't find him that good as he
was in this film. This is a masterpiece made by Spielberg.The black and
white color makes u feel in that world and i think the movie would not
be good in color as it is in back and white.<br /><br />This movie has three strong performances and i gave this movie 10 out
of 10.
