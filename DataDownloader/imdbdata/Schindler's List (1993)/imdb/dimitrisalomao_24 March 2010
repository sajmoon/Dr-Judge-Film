&#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22; is the kind of movie that, because of its historical
accuracy, could be used as a documentary. But it also gives us a deep
story, and a performance by Liam Neeson, that is among the best of all
time.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson), a vain, glorious
and greedy German businessman who becomes unlikely humanitarian amid
the barbaric Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory
into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who
managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz
concentration camp.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg has a technical talent like no one else has. His
frames are so elegant and objective, that you know what is going on,
and where (in the last battle of &#x22;Saving Private Ryan&#x22; you can notice
this qualities better), which makes us feel that we are living the
movie. The massacres and killing scenes are distressing, because it
looks like it&#x27;s happening to you. And the idea of making this movie
black and white gives a tone of reality, that looks like the movie was
shot during WWII.<br /><br />The plot, beyond giving us a history lesson, shows the amazing story of
Orkar Schindler, whose personality and turns are probably the best
thing in the movie, and powered by Liam Neeson&#x27;s incredible and
contained performance, that is just one of the best. And other great
characters, Ben Kingsley as Stern, as the smart, but quiet Jew, Fiennes
as Goeth, the obsessed with power German (Although I thought it was
exaggerated sometimes, like when he wakes up, and shoot Jews with a
rifle, just for fun). And the construction of the characters is very
well made, which makes the ending even more powerful, being one of the
most moving scenes in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Verdict: Probably Spieberg&#x27;s best work, with a moving and accurate
story, and a mesmerizing performance by Liam Neeson, this movie is
simply, one of the best.
