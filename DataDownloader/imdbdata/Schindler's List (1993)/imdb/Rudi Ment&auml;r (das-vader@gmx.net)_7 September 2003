What Steven Spielberg has charmed on screen is the perfection of movie
arts.
No else topic is so moving and offers so many stuff, as the holocaust of
the
second world war. That what Spielberg wanted to show is not the pain but
the
life... the worth of every single life on this world.
Spielberg's directing in this movie is the best of all. No other director
controls cinematic style means in that perfect way. Every shot in this
movie
is so perfect!
It's the best movie of all time, no question. Of course it's not the
favourite movie of everybody, but cinemastic it's the most perfect!
