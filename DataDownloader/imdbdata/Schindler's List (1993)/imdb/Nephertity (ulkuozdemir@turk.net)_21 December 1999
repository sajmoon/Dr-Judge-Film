Schindler's List is the ever best movie I have seen within my whole life
period of time.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is the unique man who really does deserve the definition
&quot;genius child&quot; of cinema.<br /><br />Thank you Steven Spielberg, for all the wonderful vision you have brought
into cinema world and thus into our lives...
