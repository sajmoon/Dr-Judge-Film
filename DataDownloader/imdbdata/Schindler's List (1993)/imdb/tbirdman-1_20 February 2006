After having viewed this movie several times both in the theater and on
cable TV, along with having seen my own copy on DVD I have always been
quite impressed by the Oscar nominated performance by Liam Neeson. Now
with all due respect to actor Tom Hanks who'd won for his role in
&quot;Philadelphia&quot; I've always felt that the best actor honor should've
gone to Liam Neeson. I don't recall the other nominated actors that
year though the portrayal of Oskar Schindler was outstanding and very
convincing. And besides the following year at the Oscar ceremony Tom
Hanks won the top acting honors for &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot; Furthermore I've
always found that this movie at the time was really over-hyped back in
1994. And today I still consider this movie to be quite overrated!
There are many fans of Tom Hanks who'll disagree and that's
understandable. I'll even add that Liam Neeson was robbed of the best
actor award. I've followed the history of the Jews, the Nazi party and
WWII for many years and still hold this film in awe.
