Schindler`s List is an over 3 hour long drama in black/white.
This in itself is more than enough to put off younger viewers from watching
this film.  The movie is about Oskar Schindler who came to Poland as a
business man, and ended up saving 1100 Jews from extermination.
The fact that the movie is filmed in black and white is quite a masterstroke
from Steven Spielberg.  This means that the movie looks like an old
documentary, instead of a feature-film from Hollywood.  The movie is packed
with emotions and shows who war brings out the cruelty in all people.  Being
able to understand the German language, I was delighted to see that
small-talk between the soldiers were in genuine German and not
English.
The scenes from the concentration-camps(KZ-LAGER)are really scary and nasty,
but very realistic. Prepare yourself to watch the cruelties of the Nazis in
a way that you won`t see in other feature-films, only in
documentaries.
