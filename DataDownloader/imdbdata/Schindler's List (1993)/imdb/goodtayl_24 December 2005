This is a black and white, 3 hour plus true story, right? Where is
their any eye candy in it, either? I would rather read a book, wouldn't
you? The topic of the holocaust is all there on PBS specials as well.
There was an Elvis t.v. series done in b&amp;w in the 90's, and it sank
after 4 episodes. Mention Saving Private Ryan as a great current war
movie, gritty,witty, and you might hear a pin drop. SPR became a
turning point when movies became more of a risk with the audience.Less
about the income and more about the outcome. I am reading Collapse, How
some modern societies are in danger of killing themselves. Just because
we fought off Hitler, it doesn't make it our choice to get personal
with it's history. It was a war that had to be fought, and put behind
us like you do with work that is done.
