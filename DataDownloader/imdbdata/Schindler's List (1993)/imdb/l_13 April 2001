No doubt a powerful and disturbing film about THE MOST tragic time in
humanity, and it broke my heart to see all the mistreatment and the
carelessness/complete disregard for human life. I can't help wonder, though,
if the story is really credible. Why would a German businessman risk his
life and undergo bankruptcy to save people that his very people were
against? If this story really is true, I doubt he did so out of the kindness
of his heart, but more for reputation-boosting. I expected a lot from this
film, after all, it outlines something horrifying and truly a tragedy, but I
couldn't help thinking that this film undermined the sensitivity of this
subject by including a greedy, selfish, profiteering, womanizing German
businessman in the story. I think that if you really want to learn more
about the Holocaust, it should not be through films such as this, but
through actual real-life documentaries that include no &quot;other&quot; unnecessary
characters/stories, but truly tell the real pain, the real hurt and loss of
the Jewish people who were treated so badly just because they believed
differently from others. Regardless, there were some truly powerful moments
in the film: The pictures of the starving prisoners who were forced to strip
and be inspected by Nazi doctors, who would determine whether they could
work or whether they should be killed. The little girl in the bright red
dress, the only color, the only sunshine, in an otherwise gray, dark period
of time, the very essence of innocence, and her symbolism later in the film
when her lifeless body is wheelbarrowed over to the ever-growing pile of
dead bodies that were to be incinerated. When Amon Goeth's young Jewish maid
asks Oskar Schindler why he shot an elderly woman who was just passing by,
bothering no one, looking at no one; his reply: because she meant nothing to
him, she was just one of those people who neither bothered nor pleased him,
just that she was just a random person with no meaning to him, was the
reason why he so cruelly took a life so easily.<br /><br />I do think this film is worth watching, no doubt, but please don't
automatically assume you know everything about the Holocaust because you
watched this film; this film portrayed life less harshly than life for the
imprisoned actually was. Please watch documentaries on the Holocaust,
research more through books and legitimate media, if you want the true
facts.<br /><br />
