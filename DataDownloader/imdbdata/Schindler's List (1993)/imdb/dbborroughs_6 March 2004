To me this story of Schindler is a split personality of a film. On one hand
its stark black and white photography and realistic view of life in the
ghetto and the camp is a kick in the heart. The problem is what should have
been a stark gripping in your face take on the Nazi destruction of those it
hated is undercut by a classic MGM 1940's style photography in every other
scene. I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making
this and not Spielberg. To me it has always felt that Spielberg waffled on
the subject because he feared what the reaction would be.<br /><br />Its not a bad film, its just not the great one it wants to
be.
