Steven Spielberg on the holocaust. Naturally the kids are cute even as
they are diving into the excrement-filled waters of the latrine to hide
from the Nazis... Schindler, played believably by big, handsome Liam
Neeson (he was the guy Whoopi Goldberg was panting over at the Oscars
last month) is a sweet womanizer who exploits Jewish labor in his
factories and then feels guilty about it and ends up saving the lives
of eleven hundred. Ben Kingsley plays his accountant with precision and
his usual subdued intensity. We have again all the Nazi horror, in some
ways worst than ever, and rightly so. Here we see a lot of the random
shooting of people. The Nazis just use them for target practice or blow
their brains out just to be doing something. The cattle cars are there
and the gas ovens and the Nazi psychopaths and all the rest of it,
although Spielberg adds some touches like Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi who
kept a Jewish woman he was interested in but couldn&#x27;t love or even
rape, but could only beat. And among the guards who are herding the
Jews along are a couple who smile at the kids, as though Spielberg is
saying, &#x27;here is this juxtaposition: the horror of the most degraded
and inhuman acts known to humankind, but look even the monsters think
the kids are cute.&#x27;<br /><br />We humans ought to have our face rubbed in this at least once a decade.
Still I think the concentration camp bits from Sophie&#x27;s Choice (1982),
to which Spielberg owes something, were better. But maybe that&#x27;s faulty
memory. And filming the whole thing in black and white and then turning
it all to color with the shot of the actual Jews (now middle-aged) that
Schindler saved from the Nazis was a bit stagy, although I have to say
showing that one little Jewish girl&#x27;s red dress (the only bit of color
in the movie until the end) was a striking touch: we see her in the red
dress when she hides and then when they dig up the bodies we see it
again.<br /><br />(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &#x22;Cut
