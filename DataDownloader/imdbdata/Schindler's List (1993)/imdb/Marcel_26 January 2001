Watching this movie is just three hours of full excitement. I personally
have seen it several times and I am sure I will enjoy it again. Especially
Ralph Fiennes did an excellent job playing the role of Amon G&ouml;th. It
certainly was not easy to play this psychopath. I also like the fact that
this movie crosses out, that they were also &quot;good&quot; Germans during the Nazi
time. All what Oskar Schindler did at the very beginning was for his very
own benefit. So it is quite amazing how he turned to be such a caring and
helpful person. And the part of Itzhak Stern is also just great! First he
played along with Schindler's plan because this brought him to the
position
to help his fellow people. He did not like Schindler at all, he even
refused
to have a drink with him. But step by step he realized how Schindler's
character really was. And near the end, when Schindler offered to have a
drink with him at the end of the war, he preferred to have one straight
away.
In my opinion watching this movie is just a MUST!!
