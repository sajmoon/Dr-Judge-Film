It has been said that Americans have not contributed proportionately to
art
culture.  Perhaps it is true that America is not noted for its painters,
sculptors, music, or cuisine.  So what has the US contributed?  After
seeing
a movie like &quot;Schindler's List&quot; it is clear that the greatest contribution
of the United States to art culture is film.<br /><br />This film is very possibly Spielberg's opus.  That is saying quite a
bit.
