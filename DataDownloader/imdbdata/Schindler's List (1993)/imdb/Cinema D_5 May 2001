Simply stated, this was the movie of the 90's. If you were to put each Best
Picture Winner in the 90's up against each other and vote to see which
movie
people thought was the best, it would assuredly win. Words simply cannot
describe the power of this movie. For an even better movie experience, read
the book &quot;Night&quot; by Elie Wiesel before viewing this film. You will then
gain
a better appreciation for Spielberg's attention to every detail, and you
will instantly sense the realistic power and importance of every scene. Its
ending brings goosebumps to me even after viewing it several times. The
acting is superb, the details and authenticity are unmatched, and the movie
is sheer brilliance. In the long list of smashingly successful Spielberg
films, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; ranks at the very top.
