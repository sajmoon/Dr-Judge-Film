To me, this one is Speilberg's best. He won the Oscar he shoulda had for ET
in '82 or Raiders the year before. Intense, extremely moving, real, very
well acted, stark, unsettling, shattering end. <br /><br />I have seen this once. It was a true classic in every sense of the word. By
all means, do see it-not for kids. They should make one like this every
year, but of course that's impossible.<br /><br />**** outta **** <br /><br />Best film of the '90s.
