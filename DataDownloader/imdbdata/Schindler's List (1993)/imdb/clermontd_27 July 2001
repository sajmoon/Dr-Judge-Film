I first saw Schindler's List on it's opening weekend.  The theater was full.
One of the most remarkable things I observed was the stone silence of the
audience, I felt awkward just picking up my soda.<br /><br /> As a person who has a great deal of interest in the Holocaust and WWII in
general and has been to both The Holocaust Museum in Washington and Yad
Vashem in Jerusalem, I found this film realistic and deeply moving.  For
those who found the film 'boring' or yet another opportunity to question
Spielberg's ability I am sorry that they missed a great movie.<br /><br />The appeal of this film is that it is based on a true story. If this were
not so, it would not be anywhere near the top ten as a movie.  The power of
this film comes from the fact that Oskar Schindler and his list actually
existed.  This powerful reality of 'Schindler's List' overrides the lack of
whiz bang entertainment or the minutia of fine film making.<br /><br />I judge a film by how I feel about it immediately afterward and again the
next day.  Normally, I stand up, grab my keys and get back to reality. In
the case of Schindler's List I didn't shake it for a while, I wasn't even
conversational for probably an hour.<br /><br /> I also would like to address the issue of the little girl in the red coat.
The value, to me, in this twist was to point out that each death was a
personal tragedy, that these were individuals, not merely faceless masses
from a black and white documentary.  If any of us sat and wondered about her
individual story, even for a second, Spielberg was successful.<br /><br /> I will leave the analysis of character development, casting, and Spielberg
himself to the pseudo-intellectuals who frequent this site, but to me
Schindler's List was a powerful film.
