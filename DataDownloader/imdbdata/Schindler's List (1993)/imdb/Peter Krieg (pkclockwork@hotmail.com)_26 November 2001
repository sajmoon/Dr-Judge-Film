On one hand this movie is the most realistic and cruel visualisation
of
the Nazi-theme, on the other hand an extremely hard try of
Spielberg
to finally cash in his oscars after 20 years of moviemaking.<br /><br />But in the end this film is a must see for everyone, especiallly in
a
time of violence and rising racism, our time!<br /><br />Once again, congratulations MR. SPIELBERG!
