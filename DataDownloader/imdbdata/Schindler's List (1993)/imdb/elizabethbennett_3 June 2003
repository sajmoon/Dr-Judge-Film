I cried through this movie.....I have never felt so moved, drained, upset
and hit like a ton of bricks like I did this movie. I cried and
cried........I felt badly for those people. I am really surprised Hitler was
not the Anti-Christ, what he did was beyond sadistic and I hope he fries for
eternity, nobody deserves it more. GREAT MOVIE! These folks out did
themselves on this one.
