This film is a beauty in itself. All this happend during the second
world-war. The poor Jews were killed and brutally murdered in the most
places of Europe by the Nazi-people. 
This film is located round a German man by the name Oscar Schindler who
tried for 110% to save as many jews as possible. 
You follow his vision about this, and lot's of disgusting things happens on
his way to the Jewish freedom.
Schindler's list is a film that everybody Should see, even though you like
or dislike films like this one. ALL of these sequences is based on TRUE
story, and has got some reflections in the Middle-east situation today. That
the jews always has been a hunted people.<br /><br />You really Should see this film.
Shalom, Goodbye, Hej D&aring;, Aurevoir, Auf Wiedersehn.
