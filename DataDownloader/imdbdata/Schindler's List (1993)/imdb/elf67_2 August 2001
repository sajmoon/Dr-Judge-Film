&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is terrific filmmaking, with Spielberg at his peak as a
director and wonderful cinematography. My big criticism is that for a
&quot;Holocaust&quot; film, it doesn't let us into the Jews' world -- they remain,
mostly, faceless victims. For a better portrayal of life inside
concentration camps, try reading &quot;Maus.&quot;
