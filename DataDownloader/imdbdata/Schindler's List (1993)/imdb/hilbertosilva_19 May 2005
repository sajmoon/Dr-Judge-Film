This movie is just the best movie ever... Spilberg shows to the world
the best that can be done with a camera. My congratulations to one of
the best cinema performers ever:Liam neeson. He is simply great! The
idea of filming this movie in black and white is just brilliant! and,
of course, the colour details all across the movie to focus the public
attention, is just one of the small things that makes Steven Spielberg
one of the most remarkable directors of all the 7th art history. I must
disagree of those who voted The godfather as the best movie ever... and
the lord of the ring: the return of the king the 3rd best! Its a great
movie, i agree! But better than these, better than Casablanca, better
than one flew over cuckoo's nest, better than silence of the lambs?
just to name a few. Schindler's list should be the number one, that,
for me is clear!
