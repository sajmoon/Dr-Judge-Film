It is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Amazing photography,
cinematography, acting, directing, writing etc. etc. It's also a very poetic
film, I've seen it 4 times (first time being back in 1995) and it gets
better with every viewing. The visual images are thoughtful and provocative.
One of the most powerful, intelligent, and triumphant stories I've seen on
film in a very long time. The acting from Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and
Ben Kingsley are three of the unforgettable performances of all time. A
great story about the Haulocost.<br /><br />
