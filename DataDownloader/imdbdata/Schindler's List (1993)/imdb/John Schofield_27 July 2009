Last January a friend and I travelled to Kracow in Poland for a long
weekend and while we were there we visited a town 50 kilometres from
Kracow called Oswiecim or what the Nazis called Auschwitz. Had we
visited that place 65 years ago I suspect what we would have seen then
was graphically illustrated in this film. I do not know whether the
film is historically accurate but the horror and degradation did take
place and a man named Schindler tried to get a number of people out of
that area before they became statistics too. The film in my opinion
probably describes the times for those in NAZI occupied mainland Europe
perfectly. In order to get anything that you wanted or needed you had
to deal directly with people who had the power to have anybody killed
on a whim not just because they could but also because they probably
liked it. Oskar Schindler was an extremely good actor he must have been
to have done what he did. Yes he paid a lot of money for these peoples
lives but he had to go along with whatever happened no matter how bad
to achieve what he did. The 1200 people he saved would probably not
have survived but for his actions. This film may as well be a CCTV tape
of those times and is therefore not fiction and anybody watching the
film for the first time needs to keep that in mind.
