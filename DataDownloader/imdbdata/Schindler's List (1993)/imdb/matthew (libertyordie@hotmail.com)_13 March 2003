Schindler's List, an amazing and powerful movie, does not appropriately
belong in the &quot;War&quot; genre, as the principal setting, while occurring
during
World War II, does not involve the war itself. Though the movie may seem
to
move beyond what might be considered under &quot;Drama,&quot; it does not warrant
inclusion in the &quot;War&quot; genre. But this is merely my two
cents.
