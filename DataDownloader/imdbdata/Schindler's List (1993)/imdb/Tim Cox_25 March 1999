An intense and moving motion picture that shocks,
astounds
and amazes in all of its 3 hours and 17 minutes. Liam Neeson
is superb as Schindler, a womanizing bastard who profiteered
off the sweat and tears of countless numbers of Jews at
the start of the 1940's. As time went on, he saw the demise of
the Jewish to Nazi rule and took a stand to save as many
as he could. He ended up saving 1,100 Jews and he is considered, to this
day, a savior. Neeson's transformation throughout the
course of the film from Nazi supporter to Savior of the People is a poignant
journey of soul searching. When you watch the piece, you may wonder, &quot;Is he
changing because he's out of money? Does money truly matter at this point
anymore? I think many would agree that Schindler had an awakening and
that
saving the people and himself was his destiny. He found
peace
with himself and with God. <br /><br />Steven Speilberg gives us a story that he has never imagined he could
bring to us. He brings real life horror. A horror many people cannot
confront as a survivor, let alone
as an actor. Every actor should be commended for their
courage
in telling this important story. I am not Jewish, so all I
can feel is sadness and sorrow for the tragedies that took
place, but I cannot the anguish the countless families
have felt for decades over the loss of parents, grandparents
and children alike. <br /><br />With an intense screenplay from Stephen Zallian and
cinematography and art direction that is the finest in
years. Ralph Fiennes is outstanding as the Nazi soldier
who treats Jews as cattle. The scene where he awakes, picks
up a rifle and commences firing on a Jewish woman standing
alone is true horror. <br /><br />Through the course of this film, I turned my head
away countless times, not knowing what made people do what
they do. Was their hope? Hope. That seems to be the key
word
in describing this movie. Hope is what Oskar Schindler
gave
1,100 Jews. He gave them hope. He gave them life!
