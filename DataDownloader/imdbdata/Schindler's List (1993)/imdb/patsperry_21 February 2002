Yep, 100. It's just so terrible that's probably more than it deserves. The
reason it's in black and white is because it's so bad, if it were in color
than people could actually see the fake blood is, in fact, ketchup! I
believe this movie is over rated and I even think Escape From L.a and the
new Rollerball are better than it(they are both at least 50 times better).
I
find Schindlers List a very not so accurate movie but I guess I do have to
give it credit for what it stands for. But that is only putting it nicely.
Worst movie ever? No. &quot;Johnny got his gun&quot; is still #1 for worst(I reviewed
it. Read it. It's very funny!).But Schindlers List is #2 for terrible films
so don't see it.You'll never get those 3 hours back. Yep it's just that
bad!
