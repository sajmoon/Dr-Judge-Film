This movie has to be one of the most moving films I have ever seen.  I
have
to admit that I was apprehensive about seeing it.  I had heard that it was
disturbing and very deep.  I'm not much of a history person, but I would
recommend this movie to anyone.  Liam Neeson provides an unforgettable
performance as Schindler.  As you watch, you go through such a roller
coaster of emotions.  It is disturbing and graphic and I would not
recommend
that children under the age of 12 watch and even then with parental
supervision.  The end is the most touching part and I cried at Schindler's
humble heroism.  Great Film!  Spielberg does it again!
