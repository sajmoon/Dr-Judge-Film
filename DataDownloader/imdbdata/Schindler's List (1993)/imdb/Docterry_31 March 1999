I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of
Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes
of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a
change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released.
The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and
was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me
and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget
the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.<br /><br />This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and
cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so
divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I
forgot what life is capable of becoming.<br /><br />Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize
things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by
Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where
the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled
through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted
boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was
something that actually happened.<br /><br />I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he
could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second
inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld
to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to
back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would
have been more careful and edited out this truly &quot;sentimental&quot; passage with
violins going haywire.<br /><br />Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private
Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest
directors of film ever.
