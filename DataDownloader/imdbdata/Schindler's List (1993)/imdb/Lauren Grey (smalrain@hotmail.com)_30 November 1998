&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a disappointment.  Spielberg packaged the Holocaust
for Hollywood, and we ate it up.<br /><br />By choosing the story of Oskar Schindler Spielberg gave us a version of the
Holocaust that we want to see: one that ends happily.  We walk out of the
theater feeling satisfied and breathing a sigh of relief that &quot;everything
turned out OK in the end.&quot;  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a story that is untypical
of the horrible reality of the Holocaust, and it gives us the false sense
that there were more Oskar Schindler's that rescued Jews.<br /><br />Throughout the film Jews are saved from catastrophe in typical Hollywood
fashion:  Stern is pulled off a train bound for deportation just in time, a
train full of women are rescued from Auschwitz when it is discovered they
are &quot;Schindler Jews,&quot; an old man is not killed when the Germans' guns all
fail to fire, the women are not gassed in the showers.  It is not that these
things did not happen - but they are the exception.  These rescues strewn
throughout the movie allow the viewer to feel relief that detracts from the
reality of the Holocaust.<br /><br />&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is sentimental and, with its happy Hollywood ending,
allows us to feel good about the Holocaust.  How sad that we have allowed a
movie that falsifies the ultimate reality of the Holocaust to sweep us off
our feet.  It has been hailed as &quot;the greatest Holocaust film ever made,&quot;
but if it was the greatest - wouldn't it tell the truth in totality?
