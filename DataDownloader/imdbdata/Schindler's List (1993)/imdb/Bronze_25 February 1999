Martin Scorsese was right. A jewish director could do a better job. Steve
Spielberg made this the best film anyone could make it. Everything about it
was done with great care and great respect for the 11 million victims of the
Holocaust. The acting was also done with care and respect. Liam Neeson
playing Schindler had the best male performance while Anna Mucha ( Danka
Dresner ) and Embeth Davidth ( Helen Hirsh ) had the best female
performances.<br /><br />Although it isn't a film you would enjoy seeing you should see. Just so you
can find out what really happened in the Holocaust.
