Excluding the alleged twist of historical facts, I&#x27;m really surprised
at the number of people that hated this film. The acting is phenomenal
and Spielberg may be rightly accused of being manipulative, but any
film that can move 80% of an audience (I attended an opening night
showing) to tears is incredible. There&#x27;s a technical kudo: review the
tracking shot Spielberg used when the Nazis invade the city
(Schindler&#x27;s on horseback on a date)... an astonishing achievement
(superior to famous 1962&#x27;s The Longest Day tracking scene...). I also
love some of our foreign friends&#x27; opinions vis-a-vis our treatment of
Indians, the Ludlow Massacre, etc. (inarguably horrible chapters in
U.S. history). But that&#x27;s akin to saying a British film stinks thanks
to the Crusades. This is an outstanding film and certain scenes still
resonate in my head (the child in the latrine, Schindler&#x27;s end-of-film
breakdown... or how I never could seem to pronounce Ralph, Rafe...
Raphe... Finney... Finez... oh, forget it). This rates a 10++++ (and I
hated 1941 and had a difficult time with Empire of the Sun...)
