I dare not rate this film but only give some thoughts. If I was
watching it to be entertained, it would receive a negative number. If I
was watching it strictly with a critical eye as to judge if it is a
well made film, I might have to give it an 11. Be it contrivance or
not, this is the most powerful and disturbing film I have ever
experienced.<br /><br />The violent and disturbing scenes depicted in this film are based in
fact. They are recent history for that matter. That makes it very hard
to endure. And worse, the inhumanity of genocide continues to this very
day. I have little doubt that the scenes depicted in this film are tame
compared to the realities of what occurred at Krakow and elsewhere.<br /><br />The film brought me there convincingly, and the pain was there. It was
hard to watch, and disturbing as I ponder that at any moment a
political tide might derail my own life.<br /><br />There are characters that kill for sport. But these are not characters.
These are characterizations of real evil people that recently existed,
recreated in the film based on the recollections of those who have
witnessed the atrocities. Then there is Schindler, who is not
characterized as sweet, but as a unique person who will not trade
inhumanity for money. It is quite an intriguing story.<br /><br />On one hand, I say this movie should be seen by every human being on
the planet. On the other hand, I have found that this movie has brought
within me a feeling of depression that is long lasting. For sure, we
must not forget the Holocaust. With a revived knowledge of this history
from viewing this film my eyes will be more open.<br /><br />I could have spent my time more enjoyably. But this well-made film has
a reason to exist. You won&#39;t care unless you watch it. Yet, you will
pay the price whether or not you are indifferent to the messages in
this film. You will never forget it.<br /><br />I propose that is the point of it.
