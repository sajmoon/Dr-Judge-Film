Throughout the history of historical drama's, Schindler's List has been
recognised as the most powerful and emotionally distressing film ever
made. The film tells the amazing and capturing story of Oscar Schindler
who was an experienced war profiteer and was incidentally a member of
the infamous Nazi party, but it is the incredible triumph of one man
who saw through the brutal demise of his comrades and therefore
committed himself to give him up his livelihood to save the lives of
1,100 Jews. Schindler's List is the one and only film that explores the
triumph of this one man who has saved generations and the film itself
has become the most compulsive drama ever made. The most realistic
thing about this epic is the camera work, in order to make the film
look more realistic to the times, Steven Spielberg wanted the film to
be filmed in black &amp; white, the ending sequence was actually considered
to be unusual as the survivors from the Holocaust do the vow to
commemorate Oscar Schindler by placing rocks on his grave which is
considered to be an old Jewish tradition. Due to the authenticity of
the film, Schindler's List garnered an astounding 7 Academy Awards and
has now been recognised as the most greatest epic ever made.
