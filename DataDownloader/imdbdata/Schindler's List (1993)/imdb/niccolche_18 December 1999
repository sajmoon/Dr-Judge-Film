A great movie showing the life of a &quot;Nazi gone good&quot;... who other than
Oskar
Schindler, himself, could join the SS just to avoid being labeled as a &quot;Jew
Lover&quot;, and then turn around and basically stab your own in the back by
saving so many of them? I personally have a great respect for the man, and
this movie is the reason why. I have done much research on the life of
Schindler, and I have come to the conclusion that it was excellently
portrayed in this movie, and who else could have done it except Stephen
Spelberg? Nobody!
