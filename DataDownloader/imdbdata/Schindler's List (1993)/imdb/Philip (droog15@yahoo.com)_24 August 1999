Oh wow, it's a Spielberg film, we can't say anything bad about that.  Oh
wow, it's a movie about the Holocaust, we can't say anything about
that.<br /><br />Oh wow, isn't this rampant conformity just sickening?  To me it is.  First
off, yes I have seen Schindler's List.  I don't care if it did win Best
Picture (I don't really give a damn about the Oscars in general), and I
don't
care if it did rank #9 on the AFI 100 list.  For me, it's too recent to be
rated number nine when there are many films better than it and more
deserving to be placed higher than it, such as Raging Bull and Dr.
Strangelove.<br /><br />Schindler's List did not create any new styles in film making that I have
seen, or have any real memorable moments in it the way other movies do.
It
was just Spielberg making something that he knew people wouldn't degrade
because of fear.  Fear of standing outside the crowd and speaking what is
on
their mind.  Fear of being attacked for their beliefs, which is ironic
considering what the movie is about.<br /><br />I have had to hear about the Holocaust almost every year I was in school,
watching the same documentaries and reading the same books.  It gets very
boring very fast when you have the same thing crammed down your throat
year
after year.  How can you expect one to remain shocked and appalled when
you
desensitize them by showing it to them all the time?<br /><br />Overrated to say the least.  Contrary to what someone else said, it is not
better than On the Waterfront and Casablanca.  Those are
classics.
