Reading other comments I was surprised... Everybody calls it &quot;the
best
Holocaust movie (somethimes even the best movie) ever made. Well, I
believed
this statements. But when I watched the film to the end I understood that,
let&acute;s be fair, that is Steven Spielberg, one of the most commercial
directors of modern Hollywood, and everything he makes is considered to be
brilliant - either it is &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, filled with plastic dinosaurs
or
black-and-white Holocaust film &quot;Schindler&acute;s List&quot;, which is considered (I
don&acute;t know, why) his masterpiese, and  the best Holocaust movie ever made
in
HOLLYWOOD - remember that &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a UNIVERSAL PICTURES
AMBLIN
ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTIONS.
But &quot;Schindler's List&quot;  is far not a masterpiece. It smells with
Hollywood and has a happy end, oversentimental episoodes (In the end
Schindler suddenly falls in tears and regrets he could not have saved more
jews)... Although Spielberg in each interview keeps saying that he &quot;had to
change his usual style&quot;, but unfortunately he didn&acute;t succeed in this. By
the
way, the last five years Spielberg seems to be very interested in the
tragic
moments of every nation - maybe because it is a very politically correct
and
successful production. After &quot;Schindler's List&quot; he made &quot;Amistad&quot; a boring
and spielbergian saga about black slaves. Then - &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;,
the
movie, which topic &quot;touched&quot; Spielberg no more than the topic of &quot;Titanic&quot;
touched James Cameron. No, Spielberg just wanted to tell us that he is
still the greatest director in the world, and that he is still able to
shoot
patriotic and touching films about americans saving the world. No doubt we
can expect him to do features about the sufferings Chinese, Russian or
Serbian people in order to win more Oscars and earn more money. So,
please,
watch this movie more attentively and you will understand what am I
talking
about.
