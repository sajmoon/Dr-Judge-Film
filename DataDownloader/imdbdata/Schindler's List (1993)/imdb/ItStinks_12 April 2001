This is yet another example of how Spielberg can kill an otherwise
passable
movie.  The movie contains some genuinely good, subtle moments like the
shooting of one hiding Jew fading into a phrenetic piano solo during a
pogrom or a close-in shot of bodies being burned that fades out to a view
of
smouldering bodies that looks like a gigantic landfill.  But, in general,
the movie contains far too many scenes meant to tug at our hearts that
end
up demeaning one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind.
The
sole use of color for the little girl in the pink jacket wandering
through
the streets is meant to be poignant.  Instead, it is cloying and
heavy-handed at best.  The scene of Kingsley and Neeson typing up the
list
of people to be saved is classic Spielberg garbage.  Neeson emotes to his
best to keep exhorting Kingsley that they can save &quot;more.&quot;  Come on -
going
into the operation, they clearly would have known to a fairly good
certainty
how many could finally be saved.  This movie takes melodrama to exciting
new
heights.<br /><br />The ending scene showing real-life grievers of the now-dead Oskar
Schindler
is some of the most exploitive, unnecessary filmmaking you'll ever see.
