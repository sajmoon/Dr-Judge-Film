I still consider this the most powerful and emotional experience I have
ever encountered in the cinema. No other film has come close to evoking
that sort of reaction from me. The performances are superb and the the
direction breathtaking. A story everybody should be made to see.
Criticisms of the final scene are, in my opinion, unfounded as it
humanised the whole story and made it hit home how one man's actions
saved and affected (and created) so many lives. I doubt Spielberg will
hit this height again but that's OK. I would be proud of this as my
towering achievement. It's a shame that that the DVD did not have more
in the way of special features. I would have loved to have known more
about the making of it.
