Back in the 1950s there was a shop near Brighton station that sold
&#x22;Surgical Rubberware&#x22;.Behind the murky plate-glass window lurked copies
of &#x22;The History of Torture&#x22;, &#x22;The Kiss of the Whip&#x22;,&#x22;L&#x27;Erotisme au
Cinema&#x22; &#x22;Health and Efficiency&#x22; and,bizarrely ,next to a flyblown
handwritten sign promising &#x22;Trusses fitted here&#x22;,&#x22;The Scourge of the
Swastika&#x22;. As a young man I could never work out why the clientele ,a
cross section of grubby-mackintoshed bottom-feeders of all ages,would
want to read what was presumably a serious study of Nazi atrocities
written by a peer of the realm.Sadly,after a few years in the Met
Police it became abundantly clear to me that a significant number of my
fellow citizens had a prurient interest in Nazism and all its appalling
consequences.This coincided with the reappearance of Sir Oswald Mosley
and his reconstituted British Union of Fascists on the streets of the
East End.Fortunately The Met dealt with these persons in a fairly
uninhibited way,and one sunny Sunday morning in the summer of
1962,Mosley&#x27;s rabble took a fearful hiding from a predominantly Jewish
crowd in Ridley Road,Dalston,whilst we stood by admiringly.Among the
crowd were many men with tattoos on the inside of their wrists:it was
my introduction to the survivors of The Holocaust. Later they saw off
Colin Jordan,the British Nazis&#x27; new Messiah in a bloody battle near
Forest Gate station,and for the next ten years,the British Fascist
movement went underground.It crawled back into the light,fuelled by
ill-informed resentment against immigrant communities, and nowadays is
busy at its evil work of setting the poor and vulnerable against the
poor and vulnerable.Just when it was beginning to award itself a thin
veneer of political respectability Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s
List&#x22; was released and stopped it in its tracks. Generations to whom
The Holocaust was as historic an event as The Battle of Hastings were
confronted with horrific events that had occurred within their
grandparents&#x27; lifetime. Central to the film is a towering performance
from Mr Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler,but it is more than a showcase
for virtuoso acting. It&#x27;s a horrific reminder of a period in recent
history when all the vilest parts of man&#x27;s nature were allowed and even
encouraged to flourish in a country less than two hours&#x27;flying time
from London and don&#x27;t let anybody kid you it couldn&#x27;t happen again.
However sober it might be I have a problem with &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;
inasmuch as my personal feeling is that The Holocaust is too horrific
an event to be reduced to a &#x22;Hollywood Movie&#x22; status no matter how well
intentioned.There are several harrowing documentairies on the subject
which serve to instruct and inform. Turning it into a Big Time Movie
with star names and marketing it as &#x22;Entertainment&#x22; risks rousing the
interest of the same sick people who hung around the flyblown Brighton
bookshop all those years ago and their appalling descendants.
