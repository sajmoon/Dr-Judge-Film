<br /><br />I personally consider a schmaltzy film such as this an insult to the 6
million non-jews who died in the concentration camps. No mention
whatsoever
is made of these poor people. What a surprise....<br /><br />You can judge Spielberg's mindset by his work after SL and prior thereto -
shallow, phony and tired.<br /><br />I've seen this movie a number of times, and its agenda of making the World
feel guilty for the suffering of the jews while completely ignoring the
equal suffering of all the other minorities in the camps is starting to
make
me feel ill.<br /><br />But what of the movie itself ? Well, do a little research, and you'll find
that most of Speilberg's &quot;facts&quot; turn out to be either fiction, or grossly
exaggerated. Take the &quot;Girl in the Red Coat&quot; for example - she has just
published a book about her experiences !!!! So much for the truth
!<br /><br />Spielberg's portrayal of the story is simplistic in the extreme. He deals
in
generalities rather than the truth. The acting is poor, especially Neeson
and Kingsley, who appear to believe that putting on a bad foreign accent
will absolve them from future woes. Shooting the movie in Black and White
does not provide any extra artistic merit, and the blurring of facts
detracts from it all anyway.<br /><br />The fact is that this is a very mediocre movie, and in my humble opinion,
received its Oscar nominations because ANY movie with a Holocaust theme is
guaranteed a boatload of those. &quot;The Pianist&quot; will receive the same
plaudits, but is just as poor.<br /><br />It is time that the movie-going public woke up the type of amoral
blackmail
being foisted upon it and started to vote NO with its feet
!!!!!<br /><br />
