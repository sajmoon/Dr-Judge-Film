It appears that the comments by IMDB users have to be every bit as
black-and-white as the plot of the average Hollywood production? A film has
to be either outstanding or miserable?<br /><br />Sorry, can't comply. I recommend Schindler's List to my friends on the basis
of its beautiful photography and the outstanding performance by Ben
Kingsley. I wouldn't have said that Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson do a great
job. Charismatic though they both are, they just put on their usual stone
faces for their respective parts.<br /><br />The film is definitely worth seeing, but I would argue that it's overrated
all the same. Because... such an immoderate amount of praise has been heaped
upon it. True, Spielberg's story about human kindness in adversity is a
sweet and all-American story. But it doesn't have much to do with the
black-in-black disaster that was the Holocaust.
