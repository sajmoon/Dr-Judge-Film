<br /><br />I saw this after I noticed it was ranked #9 on AFI's top 100. I said, &quot;it
must be really good!&quot;. I love Steven Spielberg, and this is by far his
most
amazing film. Every scene is memorable and moving. The film fits together
like a puzzle and it works so well. It reflects on Spielberg's
personality.
Other directors would choose the most violent, deadly, bloody and inhumane
stories to tell about the holocaust, but Steven of course chose the only
one
with a happy ending. (sort of)
