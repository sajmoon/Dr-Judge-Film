I&#39;m probably, well i know i am, against the majority of people who have
seen this movie, but i didn&#39;t think this movie was as great as what i
have heard. It was such a long movie, i nearly fell asleep. The bright
spot in this movie was Liam Neeson, who played Oscar Schindler. He was
flawless. I really like his emotion towards the end of the movie. Thats
my favorite part. I know this isn&#39;t supposed to be a movie that people
are supposed to really enjoy, so maybe that is a reason for my lower
rating. I would suggest this movie only if you haven&#39;t seen any movies
about the Holocaust before. Personally, i thought the Pianist was a
better film than this one.
