This is a complex issue, but I still think this is the overall best
movie I have ever seen. The characters, acting, storyline,
cinematography, and general atmosphere and emotional depth combine to
make a movie like no other.<br /><br />Haunting, exciting, once in a while funny, gripping, rewarding, moving,
significant, etc, etc. Wow!<br /><br />It may paint a slightly rosy picture of Oskar Schindler, but, remember,
it is a movie. I think this picture almost perfectly blends a
documentary and cinematic feel. I is literary, artistic, and
substantial. <br /><br />I love Casablanca. Citizen Kane is a classic, maybe the best by many
standards. But Schindler's List is movie of the modern generation which
achieves classic status by both prior and current critical standards. <br /><br />It is the last &quot;great&quot; film I have seen at a cinema. No doubt there are
great films I have not seen. Any suggestions?
