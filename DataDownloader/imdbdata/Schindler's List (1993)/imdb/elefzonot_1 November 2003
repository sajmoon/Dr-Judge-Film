Steven Spielberg directed a lot of the best films in history, such
as:
E.T,Close Encounters Of The 3rd Kind,Jaws,Jurassic Park,Saving Private
Ryan,Poltergeist,The Color Purple,Raiders of the Lost Ark,Minority
Report.....and the list just goes on and on....<br /><br />But in my opinion &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is the most important masterpiece
Spielberg ever made(and it's not because i am israeli..).
The acting is breathtaking(especially from Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth)and
the black &amp; white motive is outstanding...
But the real issue here is the true horrible story of the jews in europe
of
the 1940's..
U can see in this film the true horror and humiliation that the jews had
suffered.<br /><br />Truly Spielberg's best work with a very important lesson..
10/10
