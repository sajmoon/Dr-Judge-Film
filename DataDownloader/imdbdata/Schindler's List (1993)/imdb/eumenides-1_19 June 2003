This is a depressing movie... after all, it deals with the Holocaust, and
unless you have the talent of Roberto Begnini, you can't make a successful
comedy out of it.<br /><br />Schindler's List isn't trying to ease things up, or to offer a sanitized
account of the Holocaust to the mainstream public; it doesn't hide the
truth, the brutality necessary to consciously kill 6 million human beings...
it shows a devastating reality instead: piles of dead corpses, the killing
of jews, the concentration camps...<br /><br />Steven Spielberg picked a brilliant script and gave it his own twist and
created one of the most important movies of all times, where he contrasts
the death of millions with the luxury of German officers partying all night,
drinking and eating the finest things, chasing women and having the time of
their lives.<br /><br />It's a powerful insight into the minds of pathologic mass murderers,
revealing the human capacity for evil and destruction, that nevertheless
impairs our sensibility regarding finer things such as painting,
architecture or literature...<br /><br />10 out of 10, this movie is a disturbing history lesson.
