I could&#39;not have better chosen to watch this movie at this time, at
such a global scenario. Schindler&#39;s List will be a movie that will
unshakably remain on my list of most favorite movies, of all time. It
makes the viewer think so much deeply about the horrors of Holocaust
and the poignant symbolism associated with almost every frame makes you
sob silently. It reminds you that for every Adolf Hitler, Osama bin
Laden, George W. Bush and Idi Amin, there was Oskar Schindler, Mahatma
Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Mother Teresa. I loved this amazing
movie because the sooner people realize the futility of war and murder,
the sooner we can make this world a better place to live in. It is
painful to see people fighting and killing each other for land, oil,
votes and power. Finally, I would say that Mr. Spielberg and his
talented team deserve all the adulation they have received for their
excellence.<br /><br />&#39;An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind &#39; - Mahatma Gandhi
