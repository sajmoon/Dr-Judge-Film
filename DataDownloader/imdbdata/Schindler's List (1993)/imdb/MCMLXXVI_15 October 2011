First off, this is not a bad film. I think it starts and ends quite
well, but there are are too many scenes that seem to be there mostly to
document atrocities done by the Nazis in WWII. I understand the
motivation to put them all in there, but rather than convey some sense
of horror and outrage that events like these should elicit, I found
myself both numb and bored. These pseudo-documentary parts took me out
of the story and made it really hard to pay attention at all. And this
is coming from a huge documentary fan, as well as someone who is not at
all turned off by a long run-time if the film warrants it.<br /><br />Maybe Spielberg felt it was dishonouring the memory of the dead to
leave those scenes on the cutting room floor, but for a film over three
hours long, I can&#x27;t help but feel that there&#x27;s considerably less than
two hours of narrative trying to hold it all together.<br /><br />I was sixteen when this film came out, and I really didn&#x27;t understand
why it didn&#x27;t work for me then. Having watched it for only the second
time recently (in 2011), I sincerely doubt I&#x27;ll ever feel the need to
watch it again. Given that I do think that there&#x27;s a decent film hiding
in there, that is a shame.
