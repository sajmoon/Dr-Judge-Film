This movie proves that True Stories really are the best
stories!
When I first saw this movie I was shocked not because of the<br /><br />Tragedy (WHICH IS SHOCKING IN IT'S OWN RITE), But because of
the
style of the movie. It was not the style of SPIELBURG that I am used to!
from the black and white Cinematography to the little girl in red, I was
so
overcome with the intense drama that I actually cried at the end, which
for
a QUENTIN TARANTINO fan is a giant leap!<br /><br />This movie is a Ocean of Drama which drowns you is pure emotion that
entails
a story that this world will not and cannot forget!
