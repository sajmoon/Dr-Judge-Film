To watch this film, you must be prepared to be horrified. By horrified, I
don't mean that all of a sudden, a killer comes from out of nowhere and
hacks off someone's limb, with blood and guts all over. No, I mean the
true
horror... from the fact that what you watch really happened sixty years
ago.
It is a film that just leaves you without the ability to speak. To walk
away
from this film dry-eyed is to not be human. Many 'Best Picture' winners
are
actually overrated... Chicago?... A Beautiful Mind??... The English
Patient???... to name a few recent ones. Yet Schindler's List is not
overblown, and for all its praise, is still underrated, for it deserves
better than the best recognition. This is not just a film... not just
three
hours to while away your time. This is a lesson in humanity. Schools
everywhere should make this part of their curriculum for High School, to
teach the future leaders of the world what mankind is capable of. It's not
what we could do. It's what mankind DID.<br /><br />Some say the number of Jews murdered -- Six Million -- is overblown... but
I
say, be it six million or two million, or even just one single person,
what
happened was horrible and inexcusable. I myself am a descendent of a Nazi,
and for their crimes, I say to all... LEARN from history, and never forget
it.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg, my hat's off to you.
