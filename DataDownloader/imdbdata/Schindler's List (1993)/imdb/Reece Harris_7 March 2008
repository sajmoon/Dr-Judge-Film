I thought that the film was excellent, I thought it was a brilliantly
realisation, fiercely controlled and restraint treatment of a true
story, the film had a great atmosphere of a kind of documentary, harsh
and compassionate and avoid sentimentality until the end. And felt as
though Spielberg escaped the great and family films like E.T and Idiana
Jones and was successful. Spielberg also does an uncommonly thing and
keeps our attention for 185 mines. What I also liked was the rich black
and white cinematography. The music helped move a lot of the scenes. I
also liked the acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. I also feel
that the film and the script are well constructed. I also liked the
lighting when Schinder is at the party strobing across his eyes hiding
the rest of his face. I liked the scene when all of Schindler&#39;s female
workers were dropped of at the concentration camp, the scene when they
were put in the showers, this scene was good but suspenseful with shot
reverse shot from the screaming women to the shower heads as they
thought that they had been put in the gas chamber. I felt that
Spielberg kind of personified the gas chambers as though they were the
real killers and the executioner and the Nazi&#39;s were just the jury. I
also felt that another scene that was key was when Ralph Fiennes was
going to kill that man behind the factory for not making enough door
hinges and the gun jamming, as later on in the film Liam Neeson
discusses with Ben Kingsley about the machinery have found to been
faulty and he also made a point that he wants the weapons not to work,
also with the scene later on we find out that the man is a Rabbi and so
this could be that god was trying to save him, one of the officers said
that it was impossible that all of the guns were jamming at the same
time which made me think was the rabbi just plain lucky or was he being
protected.
