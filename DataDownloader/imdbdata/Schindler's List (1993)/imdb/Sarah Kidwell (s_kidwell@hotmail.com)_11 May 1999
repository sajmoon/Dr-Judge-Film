Schindlers list was the first war movie that i ever saw that affected me
in
any way. It is truly a film for the ages. It doesn't just focus on the bad
of the situation it also lets the good shine through. the cinematography
was
brilliant and the score was moving. all these things together added up to
make a wonderful movie that moves me deeply
