I wonder why it is that I was so unmoved by this film? Given the subject
matter and the undoubted expertise of the director and cast, I was
surprised
by my reaction.
Maybe the real-life events are so fresh in our memories. There is no
shortage of extant newsreel footage. We`ve all seen the real archive shots
of the concentration camps and been moved to tears by them. SCHINDLER`S
LIST, beautifully shot in glossy monochrome, is a million miles away from
the coarse-grained newsreels. It looks like an expensive Hollywood movie,
and that`s part of the problem.
If Spielberg chose monochrome for its realism, why then did he resort to
the
trickery of pinpointing the girl in red? Either you want realism or not.
Most people I have spoken to thought the treatment of the little girl in
red
was wonderful.But it annoyed me intensely for its manipulation of the
audience.
I also felt that some of the performances where not as they should be.
Liam
Neeson failed to convince, especially in his final breakdown scene.Ralph
Fiennes just about got away with a one-dimensional &quot;nast nazi&quot;. Only Ben
Kingsley gave a totally believable and absorbing performance. If all the
other performances had been of this high level we may have had a truer and
therefore better movie.
The only time I felt any real emotion was in the final section, when we
saw
the real survivors and relatives.Who needs glossy Hollywood biopics when
reality is so available. The staged fictions of SCHINDLER`S LIST will
always
be insignificant when measured against the newsreels
Can anyone ever make a convincing Holocaust movie? Probably not.
