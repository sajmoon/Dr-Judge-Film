Your finest work to date Mr Spielberg, a legacy and warning to
future generations. Film making at the top of it's form. A
beautifully told, harrowing story and that grows with each
viewing. Pictures that haunt the mind for ever. A wonderful job
from Janus Kiminski and possibly John Williams finest work for
the cinema.<br /><br />Shooting the picture must have been horrific - to recreate the
slaughter for weeks on end...must have been dreadful. All those
who took part added something this moving and heartfelt
