I say the above not in &quot;entertaining&quot; meaning, but in the fact that
Spielberg has made THE most powerful and thought provoking film ever. It
was
rightfully given the reviews and awards its deserves at the time, and even
after repeated viewings the film always makes me cry at the final scenes.<br /><br />After looking at the votes cast here for this film, all I can say to the
people who voted 1,2,3 just to be &quot;different&quot;is that I pity them for not
having the vision to see just what this film is. Admittedly the film can't
to be everyone's taste but even those in the minority can see what the
film
intended to do and that is the message that atrocities like the Holocaust
must never happen again.<br /><br />Lee D
