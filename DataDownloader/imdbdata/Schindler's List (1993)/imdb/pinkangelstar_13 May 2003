A fabulously moving film that captured the raw emotion of the devastation
of
WW2.<br /><br />Neeson and Fiennes were great, especially Fiennes.<br /><br />Made me cry especially at the little girl in the red coat, but nonetheless
made me laugh at some parts, which is a tremendous achievment for any
director, especially since spielberg who would not be my favourite
director<br /><br />breathtaking and astonishing<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />
