I rented this movie after hearing that it was a classic. I like that
every character in this movie is interesting. You connect with them and
recognize so many faces that you wouldn't in another film.<br /><br />However, I would not call the film perfect. Moving, heartbreaking, yes.
However, I feel that it should have focused more on Schindler's
factory. We all know the historical facts about the holocaust, but
Schindler's heroism is a unique story, one that has not been told.<br /><br />Some scenes, like when Schindler witnesses a raid while horseback
riding, were necessary and I would not have cut them out. However,
scenes like when the Nazi officer searches for a maid or when a Jewish
engineer insists that a foundation be re-poured were repetitive and
stretched out the movie.<br /><br />However, it is still worth seeing for the gorgeous cinematography and
Schindler's final words in the film.
