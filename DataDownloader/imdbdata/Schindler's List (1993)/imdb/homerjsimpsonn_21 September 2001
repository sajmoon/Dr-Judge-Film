A movie has to have offer the viewer something.  It can be a much needed
laugh, thrill, fright, or even historical information.  What does
Schindler's List offer us other than yet another look at this tired old
topic that media has labeled &quot;the holocaust&quot;?  Nothing.  There are scores
and scores of movies about the holocaust.  Why are there so many movies
about the holocaust?  To help make sure that sympathy and support for the
Jews where it counts (i.e. the U.S.A.) remains high.  Do you know of anyone
who likes watching material over and over and over and over about the death
of a few million Jews......3000 miles away......that took place more than 50
years ago?  I can understand people's affinity to movies related to a
certain topic, such as war movies; some war movies are historically
educational, others are entertaining cinematic renditions of certain battles
(such as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;).  But who the hell is entertained by &quot;the
holocaust&quot;.  After the first or second movie about the holocaust (in
conjunction with the endless time devoted to it in high school history
class), the historical aspects had been amply covered.  Now we have
Schindler's List.  There's minimal history associated with it (except for a
handful of survivor's walking across a graveyard at the end).  Look at it
this way: had the people working in Schindler's factory been ethnic
Albanians or Martians, the movie would have remained the same.  To me, that
makes for a very bad movie.<br /><br />&quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;, a movie taking place during the holocaust, was a
spectacular movie because, rather than being a blatant attempt at
propaganda, it was actually a movie that was meant to give the viewer
something.  Laughter.
