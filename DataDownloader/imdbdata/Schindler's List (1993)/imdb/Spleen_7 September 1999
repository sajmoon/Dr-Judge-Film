Steven Spielberg was wrong about the subject matter of his own film.  It's
no more `about' the holocaust than it's `about' Eastern Europe.  It's about
Oscar Schindler.  More to the point: it's about an amoral small-time
capitalist with neither more nor less compassion than most other people, who
finds himself as surprised as anyone when cruel and unusual circumstances
mould him into a hero.  It's about a man led to the path of morality as much
by his belly as by his heart.  It's a study in the banality of goodness.  I
don't know how many other people have used that phrase, but there's no
better way of putting it.<br /><br />It's the job of documentaries, not fiction, to teach us about the past. 
`Schindler's List' is not a lesson about the what happened to European Jews
under Nazi rule - at any rate, it's not a particularly good lesson.  It's
fiction.  I'm not, of course, saying that it's false - I gather most of it
is true.  Nor am I saying that it can't teach us a lesson of another kind. 
When Superman saves a thousand people we can always say, `That's all very
well, but I can't leap tall buildings in a single bound; and anyway,
Superman is supernaturally virtuous.'  When someone as flawed as Oscar
Schindler saves a thousand people it's not so easy to make
excuses.<br /><br />There's a good story here.  Many people do some of their best work in
telling it.  I don't think that Neeson, Fiennes or Spielberg have ever
performed better than they do here, and John Williams writes fine music in
an understated style he hasn't used for a while.  But it's really the story
that makes the movie.  Spielberg, in thinking that he's making a kind of
documentary, sometimes lets the story down - every single use of colour is
an intrusion, and anyone who's read the book will find that sections have
been transferred flatly, with a palette knife, to the screen.  Probably this
film has been praised a little more than it deserves.  Oh, well.  Excess
praise will be washed away with time.<br /><br />One minor point: when the book was first published in Australia, it was
called `Schindler's Ark'.  `Schindler's List' is the (inferior) American
title.  Sadly, after the success of the film the book was called
`Schindler's List' even here.  Spielberg could have called his film
`Schindler's Monocle' - or anything at all - and publishers would have
dutifully re-named the book.  It's a pity he didn't use his power to restore
the original title.
