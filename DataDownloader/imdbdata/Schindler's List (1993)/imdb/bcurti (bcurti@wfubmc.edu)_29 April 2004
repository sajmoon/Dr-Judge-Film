I can't believe I've finally seen this movie, after 11 years!  This
is
Spielberg at his best, it must have been tremendously emotional to have
watched the first run of this masterpiece.  I'm not going to give a
university professor like analysis of this movie, but suffice to say, it
was
worth the wait.
Obviously there are several horrific moments of human brutality that
we
witness, but when I finished watching the movie, it wasn't so much the
random killings and scenes of mass carnage that affected me the most...no,
it was the sheer hopelessness that was portrayed by the Jewish prisoners.
The feelings of utter doom, separation of families, and watching the
children being hauled off to Auschwitz.  I say this, because in some ways,
I
was prepared for the scenes of mass burnings and atrocities, thanks to the
old 16mm high school history films back in the early 70's (remember
those?).
Ralph Fiennes is absolutely chilling and brilliant in his role, but
it's Kingsley and Neeson that really steal the show.  I've always admired
Kingsley....I think his role in Ghandi is one of the top three
performances
of all time.  He's truly the voice and conscience that we witness
penetrating the soul of Schindler. But let's get to Neeson's role in this
movie.  To put it bluntly, how he never won the best actor
for his role in this movie is beyond me.  It's simply stunning.  Don't get
me wrong....Tom Hanks was great in Philadelphia, but I have to rate this
performance as POWERFUL!
One of the most powerful aspects of this movie was at the end, when
they brought out the survivors along with the respective actors who played
their role, and put the stones on Schindlers grave.  I had tears in my
eyes....this must have had a tremendous impact on the actors.  So that's
it....a simple summary to a complex movie in a horrific period in our
history.  It reminds us of the evil that has perpetrated in the hearts of
men in the past and continues to do so in the present.  This is a movie
not
to be forgotten and should be watched by all who enjoy top rate
acting.
