this is one the worst movies I have ever seen about the holocaust. This
movie doesn't do anything to me. If I was to doubt that the holocaust ever
happend, this movie would make me a non-believer of the holocaust. To set
the record straight I believe and know the holocaust happend.  The movie is
predictable, badly shot, has one of the worst scripts and the location
looked more like a holiday camp than work camp from WWII. Thru out the
whole
picture there is not one moment of human emotion. In this picture mister
Speilberg shows his short comings in his intellect again, after bad movies
like ET, Jurrasic Park and Saving private ryan(this movie is only saved
because Tom Hanks played in it).
And now Iam reading he is involved in a movie about Anne Frank, I really
hope he doesn't have to much influence on the script and the in the
shooting
of the movie.
