Schindler's List is one of the best movies I've ever seen, only Titanic and
maybe a few more is better. Steven Spielberg's directing contributes a lot
to that, and he certainly deserved the Oscar. When the story is about 1100
jews being saved from the terror of German nazism, compared to the number
of
6 million jews being killed in the Second World War, it doesn't really
sound
like something gripping and touching. But by showing the destiny of a small
number of people, we somehow get the whole picture anyway...Liam Neeson is
great throughout the movie...
Like I said, a true masterpiece...
