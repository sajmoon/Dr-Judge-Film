This is a Must see, no matter what race, creed or color you are. It is
done in documentary fashion, and is incredibly moving. The fact that it
is depicted so &quot;truthfully&quot; is amazing, not leaving anything thing out
based of censorship and the like.<br /><br />This is a true Epic movie for all ages. It&#39;s depth and storytelling
ability are astounding, no matter what your opinion on the &quot;facts&quot; are.<br /><br />This is a Must see movie. The music, picture work, and script are so
incredible, as well as heartfelt. This story must be told, and is in no
way biased or self-important.<br /><br />I loved this movie, I first saw it as a child of my early teens. I
cried then, and I cry now.
