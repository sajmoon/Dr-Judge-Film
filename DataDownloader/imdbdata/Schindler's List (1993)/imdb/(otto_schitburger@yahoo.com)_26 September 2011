A great movie. About the pain of truth and the fight against a regime.
About the hope and the sin. About democracy and fear.All is perfect.
Actors, lights, screenplay. Slice by slice, the movie becomes a
testimony. Not about a piece of Duetschlander&#x27;s history but about a
reality in which many of us, actors, victims, silhouettes, are but as
crumbs.<br /><br />The story is basic. The scenes are stone rain. The end is not happy,
not heroic. But saint full. A film about every regime for who
democratic values are fiction. About the power and not authority. About
lies and dark illusion. About limits and resistance. About Albania of
Enver Hodja or Cambodgia of Pol Pot. Or, maybe, Belarus of Lukashenko.
A lesson.<br /><br />About the force to be more than a mask, number or victim. And a homage
to the people for who the moral victory is more important than all
prizes. Must see! Foe understand.
