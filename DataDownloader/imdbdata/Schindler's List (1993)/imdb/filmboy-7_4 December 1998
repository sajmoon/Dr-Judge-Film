I had heard much about this film off the internet and I decided to rent it
from the video shop(Being too young to have seen it at the movies).I didn't
think it would live up to expectations,BOY WAS I WRONG!!!The black and white
added mood to the film,the acting was excellent and it was the first movie I
ever cried in while watching it.I also liked the ending with the stones and
the grave of schindler.Very touching.The best film I have ever
seen.10/10.
