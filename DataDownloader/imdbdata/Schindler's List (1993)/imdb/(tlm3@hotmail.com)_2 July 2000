Rating: 9/10<br /><br />Schindler's List takes place during World War II.  It revolves around the
Germans and the Jewish Ghettos.  Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is an
influential business man in the Nazi party, looking to make an enormous
profit due to the was.  Schindler brings several hundred Jews onto his work
crew and starts manufacturing.  Schindler runs into trouble a few times with
keeping his work crew from being killed by Nazi rule and their general way
of running things.  Schindler hires a jewish accountant to run his business
for him and keep track if the business.  The focus of the movie revolves
around Schindler's relationship with his workers and their struggle through
the war.<br /><br />Schindler's List is a black and white movie which turns a lot of people off,
however it was a wonderful concept that was executed very well.  Schindler's
List made more of an impact being in black and white.  It gave the movie
more of a sense of actually being involved in the war era.  Spielberg did a
good job at directing this movie, but could have altered a few things to
make the movie less awkward and more focused.  For instance, there were a
few shots of nudity that were completely unnecessary and could have been
avoided and modified and still effectively portray the concept being
presented.  The nudity with a few individual lovers of Nazi members, for
this movie, took the film from an engaging story with meaning to a
meaningless question and cheap entertainment thrown in to captivate the
audience.  In my opinion the film did not need to be &quot;perked up&quot; to keep the
audience awake.  However, there was mass nudity during a few scenes, both
male and female, which I felt was completely necessary and helped in
presenting a more real illustration of the camps the jews were forced to
dwell in.  Schindler's List was an excellent film that did an extraordinary
job at portraying the Jewish struggle and Nazi politics during World War II.<br /><br />
