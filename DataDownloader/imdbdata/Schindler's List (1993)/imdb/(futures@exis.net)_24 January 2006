&quot;Schindler's List&quot; (1993): I see this Monument repeatedly. It's
brilliant and powerful, from start to finish. YOU should see it first,
in it's entirety, if you're contemplating your children being exposed.
Spielberg made his own &quot;parental warning&quot; introduction, when it aired &#150;
unedited - on t.v. (a gutsy and triumphant moment for television). I
would WANT my children to see it, as long as we had some preparation
first, and PLENTY of discussion time after wards. Of course, this is an
emotional and horrific story, scene after scene, full of dark insights
at every turn, but it is the spiritual growth of Oskar Schindler &#150; NOT
an admirable man when we first meet him &#150; that becomes one of the
inspiring forces. Liam Neesom was great in this role, which helped make
&quot;Schindler's List&quot; one of my Top Five for supreme Character Studies.
You will also see a typically subdued Ben Kingsley, and a brilliant,
frighteningly evil-yet-torn, Ralph Fiennes. The music is not
overwhelming, but present and effective. The camera work and lighting
for this black &amp; white work of Art are flawless. The use of a few tiny
moments of color (aside from the start and finish), aren't really
necessary, and a little overly poetic, but aren't bothersome. During
the film, I often want to vomit, or cry, or scream. I'm glad I feel
these things. Steven Spielberg never has to prove anything to anyone
ever again...even if he makes another &quot;E.T.&quot; or &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;.
