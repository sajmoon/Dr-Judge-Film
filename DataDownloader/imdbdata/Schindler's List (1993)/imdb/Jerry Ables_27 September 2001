This movie is fantastic and very richly deserved every single award that it
won.  It does a splendid job at showing the horrors of the holocaust and
reminding us that such an atrocity must never be allowed to happen again. 
The story was awesome and the acting fantastic.  Everyone in this film was
perfect for the role that they played.  This is very easily one that I am
thrilled to have in my movie collection.  In my opinion, it's one of the
best films ever made and one of the best that will ever be
made.
