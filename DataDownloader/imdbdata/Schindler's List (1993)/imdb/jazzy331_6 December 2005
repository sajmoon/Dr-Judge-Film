A lot has been written about this film over the years, but I wanted to
add my own personal experience.<br /><br />I went to the Cinema with 2 friends to see this, and I have never known
an audience with such respect for a film, or an atmosphere like it. The
emotional impact of this film was evident to all in the audience and
no-one spoke at all through the performance or, indeed, after it as we
were leaving.<br /><br />My friends and I walked in silence to the car, and drove for about 10
minutes before the silence was broken when I came to a Pub and
suggested that we had a pint. We then discussed the film and the
emotional impact over a drink. This experience has stayed with me
since, and I have never had the same response to another film.<br /><br />Not a review, but I was wondering whether others might have been
affected by the film in the same way.<br /><br />Thamks for reading this.
