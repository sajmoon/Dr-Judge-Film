Everyone who's seen SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning
1993
film distributed by Universal, has loved it. Most even cried (myself
included), due to the realistic Holocaust story.
The film takes place, of course, in WW2. Starting in 1939, a German man
named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) comes into quick fame at a Nazi
private
party, using only his money and suave manor. With help from high-ranking
Nazi officers, he starts up a pots and pans factory to help the Jews work.
After a few years, when we have seen many Jews massacred and shot,
Schindler
makes a list of Jews, to be escorted to a German arms factory in his home
town, and saves them from a trigger-happy, power-mad Nazi officer
(portrayed
by Ralph Fiennes).
After YOU (who haven't seen it) see it, you will agree that it will not
soon
be a forgotten masterpiece.
