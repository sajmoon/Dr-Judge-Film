Don't get me wrong, this was a magnificent film, which portrays an accurate
picture of the horror and inhumanity of Hitler's Germany.  However,
Spielberg still does not make the film he should have made.  Granted
Schindler was a hero and a legend for his humanity, although his motives at
first were those of profit. Eventually he found his own humanity and
redemption.  As a Jewish director Spielberg felt obligated to make a
Holocaust film.  Why he didn't make a film focusing on one or more Jewish
families struggling to survive is beyond me.  As the son of Holocaust
survivors I have heard first-hand accounts of the unique struggles and
tortures endured, and every story I've heard is touching, horrifying and
wrenching.  One day a powerful Hollywood director is going to make a real
Holocaust film.  It may not be Spielberg, but someone will.  It is also
possible that Schindler's List is the closest thing Hollywood will permit
to portraying the graphic horror of the Holocaust.  I still remain hopeful.
Steven Spielberg is one of the most amazing directors ever and deserves a
great deal of credit.
