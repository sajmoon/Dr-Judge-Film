I've watched Schindler's List twice now, a fine movie and a
reasonably
accurate record of those events. Events? Hmm what a curious word to
use.
The sheer horror, brutality and inhumane treatment of Jewish people is
a
scar that Germany must bear for all eternity. So why, in God's name
did
the USA just sit by and do nothing. America has always had a large jewish
population and reports of the holocaust must have filtered through to
the
authorities. In 2003 the USA goes to war on Iraq and the Saddam
Hussein
regime. Nothing can ever compare Saddam's reign with that of Adolf
Hitler.
And yet, the Americans did nothing. It took the Japanese attack on
Pearl
Harbor and the US Fleet to awaken them, but how do you tell millions of
Jews
including so many, many children that only the Japanese attack
was
important enough for America to enter the war.
