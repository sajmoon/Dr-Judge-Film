I&#39;ve read a lot of the comments on this movie and while everyone is
entitled to their opinion, it pained me to see that many people missed
the point of the movie altogether. Many people have labeled this as a
horrible movie simply because it was made by Spielberg. Others
criticize the way he used Black and White film (with the exception of
the Girl in the red coat) and still others claim that there was no
Schindler.<br /><br />Just because a movie is made by Spielberg, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to
be trash. This has to be the first movie of his I&#39;ve seen that I
actually really learned something from and left me wanting to make the
world a better place. Maybe that seems stupid to some people, but
knowing what Schindler did makes me believe that maybe one day I can
help someone too.<br /><br />As for the black and white film, I think it fit beautifully. In the
30&#39;s and 40&#39;s there really wasn&#39;t a lot of color film used, especially
for Journalism and the news. It fit with the time period very well.
Also, the little girl in the red coat was a wonderfully sentimental
touch. There actually was a little girl wearing a scarlet coat the day
of the Karkow Liquidation that caught Schindler&#39;s eye and it completely
disgusted him that people could commit such atrocities in front of a
child. What happens later is symbolic of what was happening to the
millions of people (Jewish, Gypsies, Homosexuals, etc.) and the fact
that no one was standing up for them. The little girl and seeing her
running through the crowd and what happens later helps to open up
Schindler&#39;s eyes in the movie.<br /><br />Many people here have claimed that the character of Oskar Schindler was
completely fabricated so that Sielberg could get some money.
Fortunately enough for those 1,200 people, there was a real Schindler
and he really did help them. He wasn&#39;t the best of men and he certainly
had his faults. He drank excessively, he was a renowned womanizer, he
supported slave labor, and he was a member of the Nazi party. . . but
despite all that, he still did something good for other people. Oh, and
contrary to what some people have claimed, while Schindler did in fact
make a fortune during the war, he spent practically all of it to save
the Jewish workers. He lost everything he had gained during the war to
save them.<br /><br />Liam Neeson, I felt, did a great job portraying Schindler and Ralph
Fiennes was brilliant as Amon Goeth. Fiennes in particular was rather
frightening at how well he portrayed such a feared member of the Nazi
party.<br /><br />There is a lot of nudity in the movie. Some people complain about that,
but honestly, what do you expect? Do you really think that the Nazis
told them that they&#39;d turn away while they got changed? No. The nudity
in the film (as portrayed by the Jewish and other victims) was
necessary because it helps to demonstrate exactly what these poor
people had to endure.<br /><br />In closing, don&#39;t listen to all the negative reviewers out there
claiming it&#39;s bad because of nudity, Spielberg, or any other number of
things. This is truly a movie that you can&#39;t judge until you&#39;ve seen it
for yourself.
