One night after all my friends left my house at midnight, for some
reason I thought it would be a good idea to plop Schindler&#39;s List into
my DVD player. I knew it would end at 3, but I didn&#39;t care because I
had wanted to see this so called &quot;amazing&quot; film. I wasn&#39;t disappointed.<br /><br />Spielberg managed to create one of the most beautiful films ever. Even
though the subject matter itself is depressing and morbid, the way
humanity springs from such a destructive environment is beautiful.
Oskar Schindler&#39;s transformation from a war profiteer to a humanitarian
is subtle and realistic. Schindler is human, and feels it too, thanks
to great writing and Liam Neeson&#39;s wonderful performance.<br /><br />Spielberg&#39;s direction has never been better. The executions of the Jews
are brutal because there are no cuts; almost every slaying is done in
one shot. This adds to the realism and the sheer bestial nature of the
Holocaust. The cinematography is amazing in black and white, creating a
sense of melancholy in a stark world.<br /><br />What else is there to say? I could go on about the acting and the
writing. I didn&#39;t even mention John William&#39;s morose, but poignant
score, which provides much of the emotion that stems from the film.
However, all I can say is that Schindler&#39;s List is moving, touching,
and altogether brilliant. The final scene almost made me cry, but I
didn&#39;t because I&#39;m an unemotional robot. But as an unemotional robot, I
was still deeply moved by Spielberg&#39;s sentimental tribute to those who
died in one of history&#39;s saddest periods.
