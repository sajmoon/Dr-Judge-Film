This film, is without a doubt, Spielberg's best work to date.  This film
captures the horrors of war like no other film before it has.  The fact
that
is centers around the suffering of civilians rather than the military
singles this film out from others in the genre.<br /><br />Filming it in black and white was ingenius for several reasons.  First,
it
makes the film look much like a documentary, thus increasing the realism,
and at the same time creating more sympathy for the people in these dire
situations.  Secondly, I believe the film would be far too graphic in
full
color.  I was also very impressed with the unique use of color in a
select
few scenes (the little girl with the red coat).<br /><br />I must admit that this is one of only a handful of movies (and when I say
handful, I mean 2 or 3) that actually brought tears to my eyes.  This
film
gripped me like no other.  I recommend this movie to anyone who would
like
to see a reasonably accurate, but not overly graphic depiction of life in
World War II Poland.<br /><br />9/10
