Only watched it the once, if i see it again maybe I'll understand more as to
why this was 3 hours plus. See things I missed. There were times when I
wondered, &quot;What the hell is this scene doing here?&quot; <br /><br />But for the most part I had eyes wide, it was just a beautiful movie. The
black and white was a wonderful idea. Great cinematography. Ralph Fiennes,
Ben Kingsley and Liam Neeson (Whom I am not a big fan, hated him in The
Phantom Menace, Ethan Frome and Nell) Great music by John Williams and
Steven Spielberg keeps getting better and better, as if it were thought
possible.<br /><br />8/10
