A time, an event... years of terrible, inexplicable hatred, trajedy,
atrocity, inhumanity, unspeakable horror,....a period that brings all human
emotion and the human condition into perspective.  Crimes that just
now...people and countries are still trying to deal with.<br /><br />And one Jewish director in Hollywood has the GALL to package it and sell it
to us.  HOW DARE HIM.  Pure dramatic exploitation, packaged in a tiny,
dramatized, glossed over confection, oversimplified, inaccurate, contrived
piece of film.  <br /><br />All he has done is TRAMPLE over real events of time.  The worse part is that
17 year old kids---not knowing what the holocaust is, will go and see this
simple, neat film---to get their education, rather than reading the DIARY OF
ANNE FRANK, or seeing the proud Germans marching in the WORLD AT WAR
episodes, pointing at the mountains of Holocaust victims.  Any PBS film or
documentary about the Holocaust---is were we must start to get an education
about the Holocaust.  NOT THIS FILM.  NOT THIS FILM AT ALL !!!
