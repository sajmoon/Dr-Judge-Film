This film is nothing short of amazing, depicting the sheer cruelty and mass
genocide of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis during the Second World War.
The main Character himself, Schindler, being a charismatic entrepenuer of
the time, siezes the war as a way of lining his own pocket by buying the
Jews to work in his factories, therefore supplying the German Army with
munitions. His intentions start out for himself but soon turn towards the
helpless plights of the Jews after witnessing the massacre at the Krakow
Ghetto, he then soon starts buying Jews to save as many as he can from the
concentration camps whilst still keeping up a front for the Germans
(especially the psychopathic and sadistic Amon Goeth). The film is shot in
black and white which gives the whole atmosphere a terrifyingly authentic
feel, apart from a girls red coat which is emphasized as Schindler sees her
once alive, and then amongst corpses on a cart signifying the change in his
attitude towards the slaughter. This film can be extremely disturbing from
the realism of the situation and of the pure horror of the treatment of
Jews, in and out of concentration camps, causing many a tearful eye
throughout. This really does bring home the atrocity of the war and the
bravery of one man against many who stands out to make a difference against
the system. The many shots of dead bodies of men, women and children are
hard-hitting and brought of excellently by the outstanding special effects
which pop up in this film in an abundance of gunfire, blood and death. This
film makes for excellent viewing which some may find disturbing, but it
really does hit home the sheer horror and brutality of the victims of war,
which are not always soldiers.
