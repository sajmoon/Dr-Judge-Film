The Holocaust was a horrifying chapter of humanity. This movie, however, is
a very simplistic story with brilliant acting by Neeson and Fiennes. Maybe
it didn't need embellishment of emotional and directorial depth ...
however,
Spielberg isn't noted for his sublety. Well done, but curiously detached
and
disappointing. I only cried at the end, when the surviving members of
Schindler's workforce visited his grave.
