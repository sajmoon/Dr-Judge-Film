for gods sake this movies is not THAT good, of course no one will say that
because to say anything that isn't &quot;best movie of blah blah&quot; would be
antisemitic and the words of a nazi.  This movies does not deserve to be
so
highly ranked.  I could direct a claymation nazi death camp movie with a
budget of $7 and probably get on the top 250.  I write this in hope when
you
go to vote for this movie you remember that NO ONE IS WATCHING feel free
to
actually vote your thoughts on the movie not the events it
shows.
