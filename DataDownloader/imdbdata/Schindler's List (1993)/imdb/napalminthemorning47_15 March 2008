I&#39;ve seen this film countless times and I know I&#39;ve said this before
but this is still, to me not just the best film ever made but it is
also the most powerful film ever made. The haunting complexity of this
masterpiece can only have been so brilliantly delivered by a true
master of cinema. Without question, Spielberg&#39;s masterpiece. And it&#39;s
an it is exquisitely well made film. Spielberg&#39;s direction, the writing
from Steven Zaillian, the editing from Michael Kahn, the cinematography
from Janusz Kaminski, as always the hauntingly beautiful score from the
great John Williams, the performances from Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes,
Ben Kingsley and every other cast member are all beyond perfection.
Through this work of cinematic art I see what I believe is the motion
picture masterpiece not only of the 1990&#39;s but of the late 20th
century. Simply incredible and breathtaking motion picture.
