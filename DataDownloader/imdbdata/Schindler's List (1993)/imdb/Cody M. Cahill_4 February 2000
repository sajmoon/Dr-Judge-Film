Little more can be said about how wonderful this film is, but I just
wanted
to note that the handing out of the Best Supporting Actor Award to Tommy
Lee
Jones for The Fugitive in lieu of Ralph Fiennes has to be one of the, if
not
*the* (Titanic's awards notwithstanding), greatest injustice in Oscar
History.
