&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is easily one of the greatest films ever made.  The
technical wizardry and stark reality of this picture alone blow the great
classics (Graduate, Casablanca, On The Waterfront) out of the water. 
Undeniably affecting historical drama has never been more fully realized and
displayed in its nakedness like it is here.  Steven Spielberg richly
deserves life-long accolades for creating this film.  His choice of b&amp;w
cinematography is brilliant.  Every tear, gunshot, death, laugh and cry are
all fully realized.  Spielberg's epic is a far cry from normal Hollywood
movie making and that unto itself is an amazing accomplishment for the
misguided 90s filmmakers.<br /><br />Easily, the greatest creative element for this film is Ralph Fiennes. 
Without his central protagonistic presence, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; would
certainly be a flawed examination of the Holocaust.  Instead, Fiennes'
character displays uncontrollable impulsive fits of rage and
unpredictability which epitomizes the Nazi aura.  Fiennes' performance is
the best in recent years, and his finely drawn and provocative character
richly deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest ever drawn
up!<br /><br />True to life affecting drama has never been better and it seems
incomprehensible to expect a motion picture of this magnitude and quality to
appear again in our lifetimes.
