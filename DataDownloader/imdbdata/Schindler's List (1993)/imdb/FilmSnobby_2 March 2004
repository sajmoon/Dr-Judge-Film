I mean, has enough time passed?  Or has the release of  *Schindler's List*
on DVD fueled a new hushed awe towards the picture?<br /><br />Spielberg's critic-proof Holocaust film has several problems, the biggest
of
which is the way it turns a horrible real-life tragedy into a three-hanky
melodrama.  I continue to maintain that the Holocaust is generally
unfilmable, in terms of what we might call a standard movie.  Generally
unfilmable, but not inevitably unfilmable.  Off the top of my head, I can
recommend two recent films on this subject:  Francesco Rosi's  *The
Truce*,
and Costa-Gavras'  *Amen&quot;.  Both films approach this material with far
more
nuance than Spielberg's film, which, I repeat, is weepy melodrama.  (And
as
such, treads a fine line between reverence and tastelessness.)  For that
matter, Polanski's  *The Pianist*  gives us a more unique approach than
what
we get here, which is a movie that features a hero whom your average
American multiplex popcorn-tub-muncher can easily identify with:  a
gregarious capitalist named Oskar Schindler  (Liam Neeson)  who, despite
all
the war-profiteering  (read:  &quot;initiative&quot;), turns out to have a heart of
gold.  Or marshmallow mush.  Please don't bother pointing out that this is
a
&quot;true story&quot;:  those who've read the actual book by Thomas Kenneally on
which the movie is based will be rather shocked by the movie's willingness
to sacrifice verisimilitude for  &quot;dramatic license&quot;.  The biggest example
of
this is the  &quot;villain&quot;  of the piece, SS-Kommandant Amon Goeth  (Ralph
Fiennes in a career-making performance).  The screenplay ladles all sorts
of
Freudian syrup over this character, meaning:  he's crazy as a loon.  So
much
for the  &quot;banality of evil&quot;:  instead, we get, via Fiennes'  Method-y
performance, a study in mere neurosis instead of a rigorous examination of
the murderous pathology that's inherent in humanity.  Spielberg can't
resist
having Herr Goeth develop a crush on one of his Jewish housemaids, and we
get the requisite  &quot;Hath not a Jew eyes&quot;  speech, delivered with what is
supposed to be irony by Fiennes.  Then he beats the crap out of her.
Change
the plot particulars, and you've got your standard  &quot;Lifetime Channel&quot;
movie about an abusive husband.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the film is not a total waste of time:  even melodrama
has cumulative virtues, and many of the scenes in  *Schindler's List*  are
quite affecting, particularly the very last sequence in which the
surviving
&quot;Schindler Jews&quot;  appear  (in color), accompanied by the actors who
portrayed them.  They pay tribute to Schindler by laying stones on his
grave.  Moving stuff.  Ben Kingsley, who portrays the worry-wart Itzhak
Stern, must also receive special mention.  And Spielberg's technical
mastery
is never open to question:  this is one beautifully mounted film,
impeccably
photographed.  The set-design, which is called upon to perform the
daunting
task of replicating Nazi labor camps and so forth, is beyond reproach.
Proving that he's still the same guy who directed  *Jaws*, Spielberg is
able
to send chills up our spines when a train full of Jewish women &amp; girls is
accidentally routed to Auschwitz:  it's a night-scene, replete with a
light-tower that approximates a beacon from Hell.<br /><br />But, all-in-all, the movie remains an elementary approach to the Holocaust
genre.  It's tailor-made for desultory viewings by 12th-graders:  &quot;Hey
mom,
we learned about the Holocaust in class today.&quot;  Nothing wrong with that,
but aren't the kids better served by a FACTUAL documentary about this
subject, rather than an Oscar-baited exercise in self-importance?  You
decide.
