Schindler&#x27;s List is a dual film. I have seen it twice. The first time,
I thought it was grossly overrated and won its awards only because it
was a Holocaust film. This was because my grandmother and cousin were
talking the whole time. I saw it the second time because my friend
wanted to see it and I figured if there were ever an opportunity to
give it a second chance, then was as good as any. Good thing my friend
is quiet. I watched the film without distraction and now admit my
initial feelings for it openly and ashamedly, and I both regret and
rejoice in my decision to watch it again. Schindler&#x27;s List is a
masterpiece, a brutally honest portrait of the darkest and most
despicable chapter of human history that seizes the heart with a black
hand and shatters it as each crack of gunfire cuts off the life of
another innocent man, woman, or child. I cannot ever watch it again,
unless I am showing it to someone who has never seen it. It is the tale
of one man who saved hundreds from the undeserved wrath of the Nazis.
Oskar Schindler was and forever will be a hero, and this testament to
his courage captures every aspect of it, great and terrible. I hate to
clich&#xE9; such a work of art, but out of ten, I give Schindler&#x27;s List
eleven.
