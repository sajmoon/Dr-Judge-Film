This movie fascinated in the sense similar to The Pianist(2002), but
the movie forces the viewer to appreciate the beauty of representation
of the movie. The scenes in the movie can be offending or
heart-shaking, but this is the real quality of a movie that it can
successfully urge the viewer to get sentimentally lost inside the movie
and the words of appreciation comes out of his mouth. The movie takes a
turn at the last hour, that makes one feel the greatness of Oscar
Schindler and the exquisiteness of the movie that words of appreciation
comes out of his mouth automatically.<br /><br />Regarding the performance I would like to comment that everything from
acting to cinematography, from story to direction etc. is fabulous and
appreciable. The film is better, in my view, that The Shawshank
Redemption(1994), which, in IMDb, is the top rated movie. A must
watch!!!
