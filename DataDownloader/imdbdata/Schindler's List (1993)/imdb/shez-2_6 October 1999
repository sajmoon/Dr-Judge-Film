While I admire much of what Spielberg accomplished with this film, I can't
escape the feeling that the material would have been better served by a
completely documentary-style approach. No matter how sensitively Spielberg
displays the sequences of mass murder, accusations of voyeurism are
unavoidable. Indeed, there have been isolated reports of neo-nazis openly
admitting to repeatedly viewing parts of the film in order to revel in the
violence so explicitly depicted.<br /><br />On a personal note I, myself, found Claude Lanzmann's film &quot;Shoah&quot; to be
incalculably more affecting than anything in &quot;Schindler's List.&quot; It's the
only film that I can think of which should be made compulsory viewing. The
fact that it's nowhere to be seen on the IMDb top 250 is a complete
travesty. Then again I shouldn't be too surprised; I doubt that many 9-hour
subtitled documentaries get to reach Kansas City.
