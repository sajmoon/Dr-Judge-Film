By far the greatest accomplishment in film of the 1990's, and perhaps of the
last 50 years, Schindler's List is a film I have been privileged to see.
Rarely, very rarely, does a film come that achieves the status of greatness
as this one has. Every aspect of the film is perfect: the phenomenal acting,
flawless direction, achingly beautiful cinematography, superb writing and
emotionally compelling score. Not only is Schindler's List one of the best
films ever, but perhaps the most important.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems though the time period Schindler's List was made in
has not influenced it much. Schindler's List deserves to be associated with
all the great films of the 30's and 40's. Everyone should have the utmost
privilege of seeing this unmatched, beautiful film. Steven Spielberg's best
film yet...<br /><br />Won seven Oscars including Best Picture (1993) and Best
Director.<br /><br />*****/5
