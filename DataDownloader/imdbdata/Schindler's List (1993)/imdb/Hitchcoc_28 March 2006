We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this
movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of
the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment
of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film
the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island
in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for
almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about
something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone.
Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is
this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of
all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people,
even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so
accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red
coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this
film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work
of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at
the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves
the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then
sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own
country.
