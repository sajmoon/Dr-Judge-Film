Schindler's List is unquestionably the finest re-enactment of Holocaust
horror there can ever be. Dubious historical accuracy aside, it's
infinitely more important for the audience to recognize how perfectly
the film duplicates the emotional impact of the Holocaust. One cannot
feel such fear, shame, rage or love for humanity through any other
means. To see this film is to witness the full potential for human good
and human evil, side by side. To weep as you watch is not to fall prey
to the director's manipulative imagery, but to acknowledge the
abhorrent events of the time. You can watch it any way you want; my
recommendation to take the fullest advantage of the magnificent craft
employed by the director is to let yourself be placed right inside it
as you watch, without fear or trepidation.
