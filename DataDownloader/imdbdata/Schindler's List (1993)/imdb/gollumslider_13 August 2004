The simple answer to that one line summary is yes. As i read a review
here once about this movie being beautiful and that's only too right.
Of course it is very rough and violent, but then again it's a movie
about war and about the oppression of a hole religion. The right thing
to do by director Spielberg was to make this like a journalist would.
And John William's music is too touching to describe.<br /><br />Usually I dislike movies of great historical happenings or big battles
and so on, but Schindler's List is an exception. Though it tells of
Schindler himself, clearly the movie's real concern is the Jewish, not
the one man who made that difference. And that is there as clear as it
could be. What the Nazis did there on work and concentration camps is
so shocking and this movie tells of that so shockingly as you can
imagine. It even goes to sadistic measures with the character of Amon
Goeth a bit too much at points maybe. But maybe not. That actually is
the fact that makes this movie so powerful and interesting.<br /><br />Schindler's List is one the best ever made because it is the prime of
big movies. You just can't ignore all the perfectness of every single
frame, shot, piece of music and of course that acting great too. But
really as said this movie is about what happened during the holocaust,
from the beginning to end. If you haven't seen this watch it now,
because there are not many movies that match up to this. Truly and
clearly the best picture of Steven Spielberg.
