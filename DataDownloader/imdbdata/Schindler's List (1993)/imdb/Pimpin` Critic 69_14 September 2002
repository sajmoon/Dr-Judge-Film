...wait, not good but GREAT! <br /><br />Steven Spielberg did an incredible job on this movie because this is really
a great movie which is both sad and happy. Spielberg did a great job
balancing both. Now not only is Oskar Schindler an interesting man but
Spielberg compares the character/man to an evil Nazi who is also a greedy
business man like Schindler. Still what's great about this movie is that
Spielberg gets to the interesting stuff--unlike other bio-pics. To top it up
the movie has great performances and a beautiful score by John
Williams.<br /><br />4(****)out of 4(****)stars
