This movie shows why people need to understand each others behaviors.
Culture colissions have been reason to many traumatic events in history
and
this is a film showing what will happen. By just showing when Nazi
soldiers
shoots a jewish worker through the head because of this old mans culture
and
his handicap (one arm) gives people a hint of the cruelty that enrages
when
misunderstanding takes place. Seven Spielberg is a master of
filmproductions
and shows that sometimes movies are needed to make people open their eyes.
The story is great, and it's special effects too. This beutifull
masterpiece
also is filled out by John Williams fantastic score that touches your
heart.
If you don't like this movie (or find it boring) you do not have any
compassion to fellow man. A movie like this, entertaining and a lecture,
is
hard to find. It is one of the best movies ever. 10.
