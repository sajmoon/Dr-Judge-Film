This film gets sucked up as fuel for propaganda by those in the west
who continue to nurture the Holocaust industry for all it's worth. This
film stays true to the filmmaker's desires, which is to present a
quasi-historical, quasi-fictional account of the German incarceration
of Jewish prisoners in WWII.<br /><br />The film does a good job of depicting the dehumanizing treatment and
mental torture, as well as the robbery of prisoners' personal effects.<br /><br />The acting is very good and the pace is lively. For a long film, it's
easy to watch.<br /><br />It's good that there are films like this, but it's a pity that
Hollywood hasn't made a similar film about the Palestinians who are
holed up in the refugee camps, with Israeli occupation tanks and such
surrounding them. It would make an interesting epilogue. Perhaps one
day.
