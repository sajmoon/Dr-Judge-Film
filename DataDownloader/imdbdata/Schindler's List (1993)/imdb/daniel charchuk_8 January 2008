Finally watched it. And, even with everything it&#39;s been hyped up to be,
I was still impressed. I thought it worked best when it was just
focusing of Schindler, and showing his growing reaction to the horrors
around him, rather than outright showing the atrocities, but you can&#39;t
really fault Spielberg for showing bits like the Ghetto liquidation
scene, or the shower scene, because they&#39;re so powerful without really
being manipulative at all. The only bit that really falls into
emotional manipulation is the final scene with the rocks, which really
took me out of the movie and was obviously a personal, not artistic,
choice by Spielberg.<br /><br />I was also very surprised at how technically superb and inventive the
film was. I expected the powerful impact, but I didn&#39;t expect some
rather creative shots like the piano playing during the liquidation, or
the distant shadow at the top of the long staircase. It&#39;s really a
beautifully shot film, which is refreshing, because Spielberg could
have easily gone for a gritty, raw feel and probably still got the same
effect, but the near-noir like set-up made the on-screen horrors even
more unbearable, due to their glamourized feel.<br /><br />The acting is almost uniformly excellent, from Neeson&#39;s gradual growth
over the film, to Fiennes&#39; unredeemably evil yet almost sympathetic
villain, to Kingsley&#39;s quiet nobility, and Embeth Davidtz&#39;s rather
underrated turn as Amon Goeth&#39;s housemaid. It&#39;s really a shame that the
film won no acting Oscars, as it truly deserved some, especially
Fiennes for his tormented performance. The story is not the typical
&quot;exposition-build up-climax-denouement&quot; but I liked that, as you really
didn&#39;t know where the story was heading next, and it gave the whole
thing a sense of danger and desperation, much like what the characters
would feel.<br /><br />This was probably the most well-known and well-received film that I
hadn&#39;t seen, and now that I have, I have to say I&#39;m not disappointed,
though I don&#39;t know how many more times I&#39;ll be watching it. It really
takes a lot out of you. Furthermore, despite how much I loved it, it&#39;s
probably not even in my top five Spielberg films, which is really a
testament to how many superb films he&#39;s made.
