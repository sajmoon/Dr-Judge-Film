What an astounding movie. Spielberg is able to show the suffering of
the Jewish people in a detailed and humanised way that makes their
stories tangible. This movie took great efforts to show that each life
is precious, and the sheer number of those murdered should not lead to
ignoring that each person had a unique story. What is unfortunate for a
movie that attempted to elucidate the amount of human suffering clear
from any politics, is that a blatant political statement was made at
the end. the line by the Russian officer, &#x27;Don&#x27;t go east, that&#x27;s for
sure. They hate you there. I wouldn&#x27;t go west either, if I were you&#x27;
when the Jews are freed is a clear attempt at a justification for a
Jewish state. the entrance of politics could overshadow the othewise
far-reaching message of the film, which is a human one. other then
that, the movie was impressive at arousing a feeling of human sympathy
and compassion.
