&quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; isn&#39;t by any means a bad film, but it&#39;s not
particularly good either (a decent way of describing Spielberg&#39;s entire
career). Some elements of the film are very good, even excellent, but
it has issues that are too deep to be overcome, making it an overall
mediocre work that certainly doesn&#39;t deserve the high praise it has
gotten (much of which is because of Spielberg&#39;s treatment of the film
itself--donating his salary to charity, having the film sent to high
schools around the country, etc.).<br /><br />The film&#39;s issues begin with its main character, who begins the film as
a complex, interesting character who seems to possess a moral
flexibility that would have been a great asset in such a changing
society as his and then is reduced to a simple man with a conscience
despite his surroundings. The transformation is unwelcome and not at
all credible, since it seems to be precipitated by absolutely nothing
(The holocaust has already begun around him, so that cannot be the
precipitating event.) The change is made all the more ridiculous by the
epilogue of Schindler&#39;s later life, which makes it clear that the first
version of his character is more accurate. Liam Neeson performs very
capably in the role, especially in the vastly more interesting opening
scenes, but his performance is not enough to save such a ridiculous
character arc.<br /><br />There is also a terrible lack of focus in the film, as it spends such a
large amount of time dealing with its villain, Amon Goeth, as to take
away from Schindler&#39;s presence in the film. Goerth is also a more
exciting character than the second Schindler and performed with such an
incredible menace and dark intelligence by Ralph Feinnes that the
viewer can easily long to see more of Goeth and less of Schindler,
which is not a good thing for a film with such moral certainty.<br /><br />Beyond these problems, there is the visual style of the film, which is
a blatant rip-off of Alain Resnais&#39;s &quot;Night and Fog.&quot; The black and
white past with color present footage, intended to connect the past to
the present, is clumsily done, as the subject of the holocaust&#39;s
connection to the present is never once broached within the film. The
colorization of the red swastika and girl&#39;s jacket also adds absolutely
nothing to the film. It&#39;s pointless and smacks of Spielberg trying to
prove his own depth.<br /><br />However, &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; does have its fine points. The film is
still quite pretty to look at, including an incredibly beautiful,
depressing image of Jewish graves as a Nazi road, and a number of other
truly beautiful images that capture the sorrow of the Holocaust
extraordinarily well. The acting is also truly excellent, highlighted
by Ralph Feinnes in a tragically under-noticed turn as Amon Goerth.
Finally, John Williams&#39;s score is hauntingly beautiful and has an
understatement the film would have done well to mimic. These are
cosmetic elements, perhaps, and they certainly don&#39;t make up for the
film&#39;s major flaws, but they certainly improve the film from the train
wreck it might otherwise have been.<br /><br />Overall, &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; is an overrated, average film. The
performances and score are top-notch, but its message is not sent as
vividly as it is by some other films about the same subject (most
notably the aforementioned &quot;Night and Fog&quot;) and its characterization of
its protagonist leaves a lot to be desired. It&#39;s not a waste of time,
but films such as &quot;Night and Fog,&quot; Sidney Lumet&#39;s &quot;The Pawnbroker,&quot;
Roman Polanski&#39;s &quot;The Pianist,&quot; and Roberto Benigni&#39;s &quot;Life is
Beautiful&quot; explore the Holocaust much more poignantly with far less
fanfare.
