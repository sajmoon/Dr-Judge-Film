What I am about to say may seem absurd, yet it is the truth from my
heart. There are movies that everyone should see, yet one viewing would
suffice. There are films that have such powerful messages, with images
that are beyond words. They are burned into your consciousness forever.<br /><br />&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is such a film. It remains Steven Spielberg's finest
achievement. In fact, it is the greatest accomplishment in cinema.
Eleven years after seeing the film, portions still linger in my mind's
eye.<br /><br />Obviously, a film like this can never be matched. Spielberg never tried
to. He let it speak for itself.<br /><br />These days, with the advent of DVDs and high-definition screens, I have
never felt totally compelled to buy &quot;Schindler's List&quot; on disc. Perhaps
I should, and maybe I will. It's not that I do not want to see the
movie again, and it is certainly not that I think it is a bad film.<br /><br />The truth is that it so conveys its message so powerfully, it succeeds
at what it is trying to do in ways that words cannot describe.<br /><br />Out of four stars, I rate this one *****. That's right, even four stars
are not adequate.<br /><br />George
