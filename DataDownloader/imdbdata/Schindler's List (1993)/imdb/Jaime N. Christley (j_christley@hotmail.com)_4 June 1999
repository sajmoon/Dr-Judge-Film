One thing we forgot about Steven Spielberg, that no one really seems to
notice.  He is the most skillful handler of gallows humor outside of
Tarantino and the Coen brothers.<br /><br />Gallows humor:  the pain of real life, happening to someone else.  Please
understand, I'm not speaking of the truly horrifying scenes of massacre in
this film and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.  I'm talking about specific instances
only.  Consider the scene in the &quot;...Ryan&quot; film where a soldier is struck
in
the helmet with one bullet, is amazed that he has lived, and is shot
through
the head after another soldier comments, &quot;lucky bastard.&quot;  It has the
rhythm
of comedy, and we might laugh if we weren't scared stiff.  It shocks us
and
keeps us off-balance, which is precisely why both movies work so very well
for all of their considerable running times.  They also give Spielberg
license to be sentimental later on--he's EARNED his right to be
sentimental
in those movies.<br /><br />The thirty-minute opening to &quot;...Ryan&quot; and many scenes in &quot;Schindler's
List&quot;
grip people in a very unique way, and often they can't completely describe
it.  That's because they CAN'T completely sum up how they feel.  Here's
what
it is.  Spielberg never lets us settle down with one defense mechanism for
these sequences, because when we do we let our guard down somewhere else.
I
can say with impunity and without exaggeration that Spielberg is the
finest
manipulator of movie audiences since Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />&quot;Schindler's List&quot; could've been just another comprehensive look at the
Holocaust.  I'm not saying that that would not have been needed, but I'm
very impressed that he didn't settle for &quot;just another.&quot;  He's made a
remarkable film memorializing the most heinous criminal act in modern
times,
and he made it DIFFERENT from every other movie we've ever seen.  Yes,
there
are influences we can catalog, and we can argue that no filmmaker has
really
done anything special with the cinematic art since D.W. Griffith, but
that's
not my point.  Spielberg has sewn in moments of grief, fear, depressing
thrills, breathtaking spectacles, grotesquely brutal acts, and perfect
little snippets of comedy.  The Wagner-backed helicopter raid in
&quot;Apocalypse
Now&quot; did that for about twenty minutes.  Spielberg has given us three
gorgeous, haunting hours.<br /><br />
