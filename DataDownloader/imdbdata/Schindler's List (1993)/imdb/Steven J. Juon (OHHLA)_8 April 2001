Really, what more can you say than that?  When the children of the survivors
placed their stones on Schindler's grave at the end, I was touched on a
level that no film had reached me at in years.  Ignorant people always say
it's not manly for a man to cry, but I think if you can watch this film and
not come away profoundly changed then you have nothing but cold darkness in
your heart.  To this day I still can't believe people deny the Holocaust
ever happened - that's as ludicrious as saying the Middle Passage is a hoax
or that the Trail of Tears is an exaggeration by Native American activists. 
Bullsh*t.  The level of depravity humanity can wreak on one another is
heartbreaking, but this movie proves even in the greatest darkness people
can STILL find hope.
