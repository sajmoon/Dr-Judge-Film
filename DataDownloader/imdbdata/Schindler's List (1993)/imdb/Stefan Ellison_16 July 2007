The medium of film can be used to present both fact and fiction, with
realistic portrayals of historical events littered in the multiplex
among the fantasy adventures. Steven Spielberg is renowned for his
special effects-laden blockbusters, but even more so for his World War
II epics that are meant more to inform and remember rather than to
entertain. His most accomplished film is Schindler&#39;s List, based on the
true story of a man who saved over a thousand Jews from extermination.
Those renting the DVD just to have a fun time would be best to look
elsewhere. Those who are looking to view a perfect take on a very
depressing time in European history will find it in Schindler&#39;s List.
This is not Oscar bait, like so many people claim it to be. This is a
upsetting and heart-wrenching motion picture that is sure to bring some
people to tears. With an excellent cast, a beautiful score and
harrowing camera-work, Schindler&#39;s List succeeds on so many levels.<br /><br />Set in Poland during World War II, the film centers on Oskar Schindler
(Liam Neeson), a member of the Nazi Party who wishes to open a pots and
pans factory in Krakow. Due to Jewish workers being much cheaper than
Poles, he hires an accountant called Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to
help roll up Jews to work in the factory. Soon, more and more of them
are hired and while Schindler originally saved the Jews for profit, now
he wants to save them from being gassed in the concentration camps.
Meanwhile, Schindler meets Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a Nazi soldier
who takes pleasure in shooting Jews. However, he also has a
relationship with Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), a Jewish woman who is
sometimes abused, but also sometimes loved by Goeth. These two stories
are also connected with those of the prisoners in the Ghettos and
concentration camps, who are hired and saved by Schindler.<br /><br />The images of Schindler&#39;s List are very depressing and upsetting, but
it could not have worked any other way. Spielberg portrays
Nazi-occupied Poland accurately and thus, it&#39;s quite possibly one of
the saddest films ever made. It&#39;s not an easy film to watch, but it
should certainly be mandatory viewing. Schindler&#39;s List is not just a
movie, it&#39;s a call for an end to prejudice. The Holocaust was one of
the most horrific events of the twentieth century and it is perfectly
filmed by director of photography Janusz Kaminski. The majority of the
film is in black-and-white, a very intelligent decision on Spielberg&#39;s
part, which actually makes the film look more realistic than if it was
entirely in colour. Many scenes, including one involving a jammed gun,
make us stop and think that maybe we shouldn&#39;t take things for granted.
Steven Zaillian&#39;s screenplay is tight and manages to portray these
real-life people very well with excellent dialogue. In addition, John
Williams&#39; score adds even more heartbreak to this tremendous film.<br /><br />Yet, it is the actors who truly sell the film. Liam Neeson shows plenty
of range as a man, who starts off as greedy and only looking for profit
and then slowly changes into a hero. Schindler is a man who wants to
make money, but also wants to save lives and Neeson perfectly shows a
man who can&#39;t have his cake and eat it, too. Ben Kingsley gives very
subtle work as Stern, a man who is in two worlds: that of the ghettos
and concentration camps and then working alongside a man who can save
his fellow Jews. While Schindler is giving him instructions, we see
that Stern is secretly pulling the strings as much as he can. Finally,
Ralph Fiennes truly shows that he is one of Britain&#39;s finest young
actors with his role as the ruthless Goeth. We see in his eyes a man
who is not &quot;just following orders&quot; like some Nazis were at the time,
but really somebody who does believe a lot in Der F&uuml;hrer&#39;s evil ideas.
Fiennes portrays his love for Hirsch very well, showing him at a
crossroads. On the one hand, he hates Jews and believes them to be
scum, but on the other, he has a deep admiration for Helen. Yet, he
feels he must show his meaner side to the follow soldiers. Fiennes not
only shows an evil man, but a man truly in love as well.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is the master behind this brilliant production and
everything about it is composed so well. He proved with this film that
he has the ability to direct serious, dramatic films and this is the
film that most people will view him upon. It is the story of triumph
and how if you try, you can help save the world and lead to the end of
racism and violence. After all, as the Talmud says, &quot;Whoever saves one
life saves the world entire.&quot; This quote can be applied to people of
all religions, not just those who Oskar Schindler saved years ago. That
is what Schindler&#39;s List is most of all about: the fight against
bigotry and injustice.
