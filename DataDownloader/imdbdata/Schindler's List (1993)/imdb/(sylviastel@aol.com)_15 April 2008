I have seen Schindler&#39;s List once and it is more than enough. This film
can be too painful to watch at times. Even though my own family
survived the war as Polish Catholics, they too still have scars to last
more than a lifetime. My one problem with Steven Spielberg is that it&#39;s
not graphic enough. The war was terrible and almost everybody in Poland
was scarred as well. Schindler&#39;s List is a difficult film for adults to
watch because it is graphic, brutal but all wars both graphic and
brutal. Oskar Schindler wasn&#39;t so much hero or saint but he was a human
being who did an incredible thing by saving thousands. There are others
out there who did their part like Raoul Wallenberg. I have to say that
if ,Holocaust survivor and Polish Jew, Roman Polanski directed this
story to film, it might have been more brutal and graphic or maybe
there would be more of a connection. I felt that Spielberg lacked that
connection in this film.
