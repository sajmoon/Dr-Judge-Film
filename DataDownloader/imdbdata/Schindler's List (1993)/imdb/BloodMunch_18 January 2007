To me this is clearly Steven Spielberg&#39;s greatest film. It is far
reaching, intelligent and historic and it addresses a sensitive issue
in a meaningful way. The choice of black and white (with one hint of
red) was brilliant and added a darkness that was truly dire. The film
also gave a feeling of the European Jews and the Nazi&#39;s as human and
not statistics. The Goetz was a psychopath but a lot of Nazi&#39;s were
historically. The SS welcomed people with violence problems and
obsessions. The whole regime was run by dark eccentrics and
uber-patriots with a chip on their shoulder. I felt that this was
history in a way that other films (the Piano not included) did not make
me feel.
