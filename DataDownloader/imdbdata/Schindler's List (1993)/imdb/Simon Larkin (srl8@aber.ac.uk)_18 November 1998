Schindler's List is truly one of the most thought provoking films of the
decade. Before seeing this film, I knew nothing about the horrors of the
Holocaust, and to be honest, I wish that were still the
case.<br /><br />I cannot believe the sheer brutality of the Germans for committing such
horrific acts on the Jews. Just because a person has a different religion or
race to our own, does that give us any right to crucify them or make them
feel less human?<br /><br />With regards to the film, expert performances, especially from Neeson,
Kingsley and Feinnes, combined with the superb cinematography of Janusz
Kaminski and direction of Spielberg make Schindler's List an enduring,
although disturbing, masterpiece.
