This is without a doubt at the top of my list of the best movies.  If you
don't like this moving film, then feel for a pulse. <br /><br />It tells the story of Oskar Schindler and his factory of Jewish slaves
forced to work.  The factory eventually becomes a haven for the Jews, and
Schindler becomes a willing partner in saving &quot;his&quot; Jews. <br /><br />A note about the use of black and white.  This is a master-stroke by
Spielberg.  The impact is extreme especially when the few touches of color
are added for effect.  <br /><br />Another note about the director.  In SO many of Spielberg's movies, he is
right up front with his direction.  When you see one of his movies, you KNOW
it.  If I did not know Spielberg had directed it, I would have been
surprised to find out.  He steps back from the material and lets the story
tell itself.<br /><br />EVERYBODY should see this movie at least once.  Spielberg will NEVER do
anything as good.
