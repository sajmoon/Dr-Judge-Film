Steven Spielberg is a master at picking up the theme. He knows that
holocaust is the best theme to sell in USA, just as Indo-Pak war seems
to be the best theme in India.<br /><br />Poorly made and edited, this movie is just an ordinary piece of work
good only in patches. At a few instances, brilliant acting from the
lead actors does overshadow shoddy direction, but even that cannot make
up for non-existent script.<br /><br />Effect are poorly executed and movie seems a partial representation of
facts without allowing the viewer to form his own point of view by
depicting a neutral stance. <br /><br />Watch without high expectations, else you might feel let down.
