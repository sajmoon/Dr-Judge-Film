Steven Spielberg has his best masterpiece here with Schindler's list.  It is
also his most personal work to say the least.  And what he brings to the
screen is like nothing the world has ever seen before- a true to life
depiction of the horror known as the holocaust.<br /><br />The story brings us Oskar Schindler, a German munitions chief who brings
thousands of Polish Jews from the death camps to his factory and saves them.
 The acting is spectacular with Liam Neeson as Schindler, the man who
changes throughout the film, Ben Kigsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant
(and conscience), and Ralph Fiennes in his best performance yet as the
frightening German commander.  Along with a frighteningly haunting score by
John Williams and great Photography by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has
created a film that will remain with us forever.  Haunting, dramatic and
true in the art form, this is one of the best masterpieces of cinema ever
made.
