Astoundingly magnificent, meticulously great, as this is one of the
greatest
movie ever done. Boasting seven Academy Awards and taking home two of the
major Oscars in Best Picture &amp; Best Director respectively. Blockbuster
mighty Steven Spielberg won his first of two Oscars, he will go on to win
his second five years onwards for 'Saving Private Ryan', has crafted one
of
the most mesmerizing and importantly structured movie in the history of
motion pictures. With a screenplay by Steven Zaillian which earn him an
Oscar for his in-depth accuracy and depictions. With a wonderful array of
art and set direction done by Allan Starski and Ewa Braun provides the
perfect tones to the screenplay. John Williams harrowing original score
garnered him an Oscar also, while Michael Kahn whose previous
collaboration
with Spielberg on 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' will also carry him home an
Oscar for Best Editing. It was the flawless cinematography though by
Janusz
Kaminski that stands out, his first of two Oscars was well appreciated to
this master, who took his game to a higher level when he won his second
Oscar for his collaboration with Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'. With a
great performing cast that includes Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben
Kingsley just help attributes the films well rounded orchestrated
extravagance. Schindler's List is the only movie from the 90's that made
the
top ten list by the American Film Institute
