in all fairness this film is in my top 100, it is moving, chilling and all
in all a good film, 7 out of 10.<br /><br />But Why is it so people seem to think this is one of the best films ever
made, it probably doesn't come in my top 50 films. Heavily Over rated, there
seems to be a lack of something, which I can't seem to figure out. The plot
is quite hard to get into, made harder by the fact the film was shot in
black and white, for no reason. It does not add to the mood, look at
Shawshank for example, the most moving film ever and that was shot in
colour. Spielberg has got it wrong, improving the mood, you don't need film
noir... he was just trying to save money.<br /><br />If you got three hours spare watch it, but at three hours it is a long time,
and it is one of those movies where you can end up checking your watch every
20 minutes, if you are not fully focused.<br /><br />A good film, but if you like this emotion filled war epic, I would recomend
'the deer hunter' rather than Schindlers List.
