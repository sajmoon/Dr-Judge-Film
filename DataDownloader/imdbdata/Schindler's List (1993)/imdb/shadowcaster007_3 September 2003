Myself and my wife have started to go through the top 250 and watch
everything that we haven't seen. She had never seen Schindler's List
before
and I have watched it many times. It surprises me that even ten years
later
this masterpiece still moves me the way it does.<br /><br />I was just reading some of the other comments and many of them are
mistaken.
They are saying that other than the opening scene there is only the one
piece of color (the red coat of the little girl).
This is not true. There is a second scene.
Very near the end of the movie in the Schindler reminds the Rabi about the
Sabbath, the very next scene there is a small group of people celebrating
the Sabbath, they light 2 candles, the flame of the candles are in color
as
well. It's very subtle but it's there. This splash of color is as
important
as the little girl. I can only assume that this is the first time in a
very
long time that they were allowed to express their beliefs and the flame is
a
symbol of the light in there lives and the new hope that they were given.<br /><br />I just wanted to bring this little fact to light. It's a scene with great
significance and it shouldn't be over looked.
