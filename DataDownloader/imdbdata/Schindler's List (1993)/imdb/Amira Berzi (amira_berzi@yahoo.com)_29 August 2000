Cinematography, script, performance, directing... are all elements that
have
made this film so good to watch.  Of-course the real story is the real
notch
behind which this is all so moving and amazing.  The thing is that it takes
brilliant directing, Spielberg, and performance to be able to reflect this
true experience through a movie so smoothly.  The attention to details has
contributed to this very successful portrayal of the great pain,
degradation
and global disaster that took place 50 years ago.  Details such as the
nudity scenes of this large number of people that conveys the concept of
lack of individuality to a degree implying disrespect and humiliation that
is scary.  The components of the characters of Oskar and Stern are very
well
presented because they are real characters with components of good and bad.
Black and white certainly adds to the state of mind the movie puts you in.
The idea of masses of people all the time enhances the magnitude of the
catastrophe even further.
