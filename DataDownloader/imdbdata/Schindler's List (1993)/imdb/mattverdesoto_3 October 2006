Spilberg did a great job reacting the holocaust he made it seem so
realistic it was in black and white but he made the main characters be
in color like the little girl with the red dress the movie was so good
i had to recommend it to all my family and friends. Th good part of the
movie that is like the main parts is when Schindler lets some people
go. After watching this movie you want to go back in time and help all
the people that Hitler and schindler had killed. This was also a good
educated movie to know what had happened to the people and yo cannot
make fun because really it is sad also so you know what type of people
the German people where back then
