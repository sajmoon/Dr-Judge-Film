Spielberg's craftsmanship in direction had to wait the ultimate praise
until 1993, when he produced the extraordinary epic &quot;Schindler's List&quot;.
It was the film that brought him the first Oscar, the first Golden
Globe, the first David Lean (BAFTA), and most of the directing awards
existent at that time. And yet, the king of blockbusters produced a
work that was greater than him, a work that rose above humanity. Even
John Paul II considered it as the best film of all time in what was to
be known as The Pope's Oscars.<br /><br />&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is the adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel about
Oskar Schindler, 'a German bon vivant, speculator, charmer, and sign of
contradiction', who during World War II saved the life of more than
1000 Polish Jews. It was the only important thing in the life of a
small industrialist who gained popularity under the Nazis, and who
disappeared into oblivion just as the war ended. 'He was fortunate',
would remark his wife later on, that 'between 1939 and 1945 he had met
people who had summoned forth his deeper talents'. <br /><br />We are exposed to crude cruelty and absolute goodness, both touching
each other and dismissive of any contradiction. The Black and White
negative gives the great charm of &quot;Schindler's List&quot;. We are transposed
to the forties so elegantly, and so passionately, that we become one
with the setting. We feel the coldness of the concentration camps, the
smell of burning bodies, the breath of hiding children in the communal
toilets. Everything is captured as if by our own eye, when we suddenly
get to notice a yellowish flame of a candle, the little girl dressed in
a red coat hiding from the SS. A masterful cinematography under the eye
of Janusz Kaminski.<br /><br />It is not a film you watch for the end, but one you absorb and
regurgitate. The time passes as passionately as the events of the film,
so boredom is the last thing on one's mind. And how can you be bored
with such an impressive cast, most giving the performances of a
lifetime? Liam Neeson is the perfect Herr Direktor Schindler, full of
charisma, capable of cruelty, unbothered of changing women like
underwear, and still a man that would not produce a gun that can shoot
in his factory, that would lie, and risk his life for as many souls he
could save. And then there is a young Ralph Fiennes playing the
sadistic SS Commander Amon Goeth. We have a total transformation
towards brutality, inhibited lust, sado-masochistic alcoholism, the
complete loss of power and humanity &#150; all characteristics of the best
supporting performance the screen has ever witnessed, probably second
only to DeNiro's portrayal of Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II.
Ben Kingsley is the tender, honourable, devoted Itzhak Stern, Oskar's
right hand throughout the entire war. Caroline Goodall and Embeth
Davidz give two memorable performances as Schindler's wife, and Goeth's
Jewish maid.<br /><br />&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is one of those films that lack the ability to be
summarised in a few words. It is an experience in itself. It teaches,
though not dogmatically, that Heaven is relative, that beauty is
salvation, that the love for life matters more than the integrity of
our own souls.<br /><br />Excellent picture of the most horrid period of the last century.
Perfect for an evening of meditation. A perfect classic.
