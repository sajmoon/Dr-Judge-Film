Schindler's list is a searing historical biographical drama, about a Nazi
industrialist named Oscar Schindler, who saved the lives of more than 1,100
Jews from death. The film moves forward with great urgency and is not a
minute too long. The performances from the cast are impeccable. In an
outstanding role, Neeson makes Schindler a fascinating character.The
picture
captures in high detail the nightmare world 50 years ago. It is an
excellent
movie.
