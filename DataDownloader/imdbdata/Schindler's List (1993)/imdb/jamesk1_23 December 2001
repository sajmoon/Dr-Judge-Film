Schindler's List is a powerful look at the horrors of the holocaust carried
by the awe-inspiring performances of Liam Neeson and Ralphe Finnes. 
Spielberg shocked everyone, including me, with the film's incredibly
realistic and mercilessly blunt examination of Oskar Schindler and what he
did for the Jews in WWII.  The film is graphic and disturbing, rarely
over-using music (Spielberg seems to be the only director who knows when to
put a leash on John Williams) to enhance the dramatic punch of what's
happening on screen.  Many have claimed that the only reason this film is so
respected is because of it's realism, that critics were afraid to raise the
notion that the film might not be above &quot;normal criticism.&quot;  Maybe it's true
in some cases, but I sincerely belive that this was a powerful story, well
acted, and perfectly filmed.  That's not something I ever thought I'd say
about the man who filmed Jurassic Park.
