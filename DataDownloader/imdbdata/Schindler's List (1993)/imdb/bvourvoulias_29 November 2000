Schindler's List is an awful movie: unstintingly sentimental 
and heavy-handedly manipulative. The only reason it's so 
loved is because of the subject matter. As presented in the 
book, Oskar Schindler was a complicated, not entirely 
admirable man. Too complex, in other words, to be the 
central character in one of Steven Spielberg's 
simple-minded morality tales. Practically the only good 
thing in it (apart from its intentions) is the acting.
