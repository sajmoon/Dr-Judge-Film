Schindler&#39;s List is an undeniably the greatest drama epic ever
displayed on the silver screen. The film was an institution in itself.
Steven Spielberg endeavors with all his strengths to bring alive a
magnificent script rendered by Steven Zaillian. Even though based on a
book by Thomas Keneally, Steven Zaillian puts in a lot of effort
mingling the originality of the book with the actual events of
Holocaust. Brilliance begins from the very first frame of the film and
doesn&#39;t end until the end credits. Liam Neeson delivers a wonderful
performance, very believable. Ben Kingsley offers an equivalent
performance. Ralph Fiennes is very good in his role. The emotions
portrayed in this work of art are tremendously related to every human
that exists in the world. I&#39;m sure every bit of audience had felt the
impact this film leaves by its concept. The aura of the film leaves the
audience pondering after its end. Overall an exceptional film that
leaves the audience with pain in the heart and tears in the eyes.<br /><br />&quot;Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.&quot;
