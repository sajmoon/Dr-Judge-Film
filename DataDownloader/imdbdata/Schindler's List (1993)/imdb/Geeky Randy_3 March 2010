The critically acclaimed epic story of a Nazi (Neeson) who witnesses
the atrocities bestowed upon Polish Jews during the brutal Nazi Reign.
Ooh, Spielberg is so genius with his use of coloring and his
pulls-no-punches portrayal of WWII! Just the type of film Hollywood
loves to pat themselves on the back for and tell themselves that
they&#x27;re edgy and honest. However, the reality is, the use of symbolism
in this film is so shallow, even a sixth grader can interpret its
meaning. What&#x27;s the point of symbolism if there&#x27;s nothing to search
for? It seems a bit redundant, because any meaning behind this film,
aside from the ugliness the Jewish people endured during WWII and the
sacrifices Schindler made, is there on the screen. There&#x27;s nothing to
search for. There&#x27;s no ambiguity for each individual to take something
personal away from it. The symbolism serves no purpose. Not to mention
other Spielberg flaws; he underestimates his audience&#x85; as usual, and
continues the story when its finished&#x85; as usual. Keep in mind when
watching that not everything in this &#x22;masterpiece&#x22; is historically
accurate. Ralph Fiennes chooses to play Amon G&#xF6;th as a theatrical
villain, rather than a three dimensional evil and twisted man.
Christopher Waltz makes Fiennes look like an amateur as Hans Landa in
&#x22;Inglourious Basterds&#x22;. That&#x27;s another thing, why is this in English?
Is it so Hollywood doesn&#x27;t have to read subtitles, while the rest of
the world has to? Certainly a movie to judge for yourself.<br /><br />** (out of four)
