The connection between the people in the film and the audience is
almost incomparable with any other film. Even the people who are not
regulars, you feel that you know who they are, that you&#x27;ve experienced
what they have been through but also realising that how bad this film
portrays the war the experience of the Jews will never be displayed to
its full effect on the people involved. Spanning through the workers at
the end brings to light what a good job Spielberg has done with this
connection.<br /><br />In my opinion this film has more in common with inception then any
other . in that there is the possibility that one simple idea can
change your life and the lives around you. In the case of Schindler it
was the red coat of the young girl who provoked an idea to grow and i
believe this is the reason for this film to be black and white. To make
sure the audience got the poignancy of that scene, that something so
beautiful cannot help but stand out against the rest of the world and
effect the people involve more so.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes brings a brilliant typically perceived German into the
picture, ruthless and cold blooded in the way he unnecessarily kills
the workers for fun almost but eventually shows heart. One of the
hardest rolls in the film well played.<br /><br />The ending of the film is perfect as you feel that it has already
climaxed with 20 minutes to go and in ways of personal actions changing
the storyline drastically it has but in drama it has certainly not . An
unbelievable performance by Liam Neeson in its last moments is what
pushes this film to 10/10
