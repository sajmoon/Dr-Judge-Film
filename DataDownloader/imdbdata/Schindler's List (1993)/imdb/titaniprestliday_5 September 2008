When I put the DVD in and the menu came in I already knew that the
soundtrack was going to be amazing and it was. I loved how the movie
was in black and white and it really fit in with the story and how dull
times were during the holocaust. If it had not been in black and white
the movie wouldn&#39;t have been as good. The picture in this movie was so
beautiful and the directing by Steven Spielberg was very good also. Im
glad that this movie won a lot of Oscars. The acting by Liam Neeson and
Ralph Phiennes was amazing but I can understand why Tom Hanks won that
Oscar for Philadelphia.<br /><br />This is one of those few movies that become so emotional near the end
that its hard not to start crying. The ending scene gave me goosebumps
everywhere. It sure deserves the 8.9 rating and I bet it has a very
high score on rotten tomatoes. If I hadn&#39;t by mistake seen the second
part of the movie first I bet I would have enjoyed this movie a lot
more.
