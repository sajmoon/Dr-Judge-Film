When I first saw this film, the words of a close friend of mine echoed
through my head. He had said to me that he &#x27;could not sit and watch
this film in one go without getting emotional&#x27;. My friend had Polish
roots and felt affected by the very events the film portrays.<br /><br />I watched this film and was disappointed... disappointed that this film
did not feel so much like a movie, but more like a very harrowing
documentary. I admit that I was able to what the movie in one sitting,
but that fact is due to the sheer power with which the film has been
shot. I, like I imagine my friend did, cried during the final scenes.<br /><br />There are few movies that truly touch on the subject of prejudice
without giving it the &#x22;Hollywood&#x22; treatment, but this film manages to
ascend beyond such grandiose ideas and achieve its goal.<br /><br />I hope that when I get older I will be able to dig out a copy of
Schindler&#x27;s List and show it to my grandchildren and say to them that
the world used to be a terrible place, where those who were different
were treated badly, but because of films of this quality we learnt so
much more about the world around us and learnt to embrace our
differences and what makes us individual, rather than what makes us
weak or strong.<br /><br />I could NEVER love this movie, because it is too upsetting to love, but
I admire this move for the strength of its convictions and the story
that it tells.
