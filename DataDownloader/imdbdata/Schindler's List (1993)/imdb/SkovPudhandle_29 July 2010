Another in a long line of &#x22;oh, the plight of the poor old Nazis&#x22;
movies. I saw my first one in the early 70&#x27;s called &#x22;The Hiding Place&#x22;
and thoroughly enjoyed it: but enough already. How many more times must
we be told this same old tale? There were millions slaughtered by
Americans, europeans, asians, political and social misfits, and so
called Christians in WW2 and their tale is rarely mentioned. This
picture stole the &#x22;evil baby found by poor Nazi commandant&#x22; bit shown
in &#x22;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas&#x22;. I suppose the writers couldn&#x27;t
come up with anything new after a story has been beaten to death like
this one has been. Like &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22;, this junk needs to be put out
to pasture.
