Although I didn't give Schindler's List a &quot;10&quot; rating for the IMDB, in fact
I gave it a &quot;9&quot;, I must say this: <br /><br />Schindler's List is the best movie ever made.<br /><br />The horror of the genocide is made clear, as well as the potential humanity
of onlookers.  <br /><br />One powerful message--that people can make a difference. Good people can,
and do, save lives everyday.<br /><br />There's a tag-line for the film, it's from the Talmud, &quot;Whoever saves one
life, saves the world entire.&quot;  If so, then Schindler just saved the world
1200 times.  He saved it for you, for me;  for all of us.<br /><br />I have seen many films, fiction, documentary, and otherwise that deal with
the horrors of the Holocaust.  Nothing moved me as this has.  I've seen
Schindler's List many times.  I love it.  It never fails to move
me.<br /><br />We need more people like Schindler, we need more movies like Schindler's
List.
