I definitely had very high expectations before I watched this film. After
all, I was one of the few people that I knew that hadn't seen Schindler's
List. Recently, high expectations have been my downfall coming into a film
because I expect too much and that is clearly the case here.<br /><br />Sure, this film is very highly regarded and may even go down as the best
film of the 90's, however, it didn't blow me away as I expected or show me
an aspect of filmmaking that I have never seen before. Spielberg does an
incredible job as usual using his keen sense of angles and dimensions that
make every scene speak volumes. The cinematography by Janucz Kaminsky
captures a lot of the feeling of the second world war, yet it didn't blow me
away.<br /><br />I found it interesting that in this film the characters seem to take a
secondary role to the setting, history and true story of the Holocaust. Liam
Neeson played Schindler well, but did not affect me like other characters in
great films. Even Ralph Fienns character was played well but also failed to
register as a memorable one.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I really liked this film and the message it sends. I
don't think this is the best film of the 90's, however, realize that it is
still one of the best.<br /><br />9/10 stars.
