This film is a masterpiece it shows the ferocity and evil of the Nazi
regime
during WWII. It displays the dehumanising of the Jewish people of which
previous films had failed to display to the level that Schindler's list
has
shown.<br /><br />The film shows the change over an individual who at the start is seen as
a
cruel, vindictive businessman who after seeing the tragedy of the jewish
people shows compassion and empathy to those that the Nazi regime wishes
to
get rid off like lambs to the slaughter.<br /><br />Having the film in black and white is a masterstroke, allowing the viewer
to
see the footage rather than being distracted by the colour, it is a
superb
film and if watched should move you to tears.
