And quite simply Steven Spielberg's finest movie.<br /><br />It tells the horrific story of how wrongly treated the Jews were during
WWII. It is just like being in the war yourself. Spielberg brings it to
life so much, and shows just how one man can save over a thousand
lives. And that man is Oskar Schindler.<br /><br />I find it quite weird that I enjoy this film so much, mainly because it
is just so horrific. But I just find it so powerful it always get's me
thinking for hours on end. It had a huge effect on me first time I saw
it when I was 11, and it got me into watching many other classical
films.<br /><br />Liam Neeson gives his best performance as Oskar Schindler. That is also
my favorite performance in any Spielberg movie. Ralph Fiennes gives a
superb co-star performance as the villainies Amon Goeth. His
performance makes that character one of the greatest movie villains of
all time. Ben Kingsly gives another excellent performance.<br /><br />If your interested in WWII films, and the story of Schindler, than this
is the film for you!<br /><br />10/10 **** (out of ****)
