Schindler's List is one of the best movies I've ever seen!I'd been given the
video by a friend,but never watched in until I was home sick from work one
day.Watching this movie was an extroadinary experience.Stephen Spielberg
achieved his greatest triumph with this masterpiece.Liam Neeson is excellent
as Schindler.Ben Kingsley,Ralph Fiennes and Embeth Davidtz also turn in
phenomenal performances.The black and white cinematography is superb,and
John Williams contributes a masterful score.10 out of 10!
