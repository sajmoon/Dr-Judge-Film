Most films, when it comes to the war genre, tend to hide the true violence
and agony brought upon prisoners of war. Spielberg has put his heart and
soul into this biography of the greatest hero the world has seen. In my
opinion, this is the best film ever made. This is due to the fact that
Spielberg did not only direct the film but he wanted to show what really
happened to those on the wrong side of the Nazis. The use of black and
white
makes the film a lot more haunting and brings about the true evil of
people
such as Pfefferberg. A well deserved Oscar Mr. Spielberg.
