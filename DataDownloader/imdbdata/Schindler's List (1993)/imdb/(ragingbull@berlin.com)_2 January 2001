Schindler's List is certainly a stupendous achievement for Steven Spielberg
and the entire film industry. For a film of such greatness to be made in an
era of slam-bang action thrillers and cheap horror flicks shows that there
are still directors who can still get to the roots of cinema, extract the
amazing examples of cinema's past and utilize them in a 90's
film.<br /><br />Steve Zaillian's adaption of the novel is perhaps the best ever. A perfect
script combined with all around magnificent performances, an experienced and
acclaimed director and cinematography that is unmatched by any other 90's
film, makes for a classic.<br /><br />I was very fortunate to see this film and to still be able to watch it. It
feels like I'm watching a movie straight out of the glory days of Hollywood,
but with brutal truths of modern society. The film isn't afraid to confront
all of the issues that went along with the Holocaust which makes it a
masterpiece along with all the essential film techniques.<br /><br />Watch the film.<br /><br />*****
