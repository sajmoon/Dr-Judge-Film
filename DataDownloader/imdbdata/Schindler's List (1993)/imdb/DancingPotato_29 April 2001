Steven Spielberg broke out in 1975 as one of the world's best known
directors. Still, if you look at what he did after Jaws, there aren't many
serious movies (I'm not say they aren't good, I'm saying they aren't
serious). In 1993, however, Spielberg set out to make a movie about the
Holocaust to honor his Jewish descendants. That movie was Schindler's
List.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a man who, at the start of World War II,
opened a factory to manufacture ammo and employ Jews for next to nothing.
Schindler is a man who has only success on his mind, at first. He hires an
attorney, Itzahk Stern (Ben Kingsley) who is himself a Jew. Schindler makes
money off the Jews and Stern is doing a good job. One day, Schindler visits
a Nazi general, Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes).There, Schindler sees
the horrors that the Jews are submitted to. He and Stern then begin a list
of Jews that Schindler will employ in his factory.<br /><br />Schindler's List doesn't take an A-to-B approach to the conventional method
of getting a story across. Instead of taking a story based approach, it's a
lot more like a documentary. There's no real beginning, and no ending.
Scenes culminate in order but not in sequence.<br /><br />Janusz Kaminski's black-and-white cinematography, Michael Kahn's editing and
of course Spielberg's directing make Schindler's List a beautiful movie to
look at, even though we have to see atrocities. Memorable, gut-wrenching
scenes are shown here. One that especially disturbed me took place in the
Auschwitz concentration camp. A small boy, of about 6 is standing in line
with other children. They are being loaded into trucks to be taken to the
gas chambers, but they do not know it. The small boy runs away into some
quarters. He lifts up planks and we see the gaunt, fear-stricken faces of
children. The small boy looks for a hiding place. Finally he arrives to an
old fashioned toilet which is a hole in a piece of plywood above a hole. The
small boy climbs into the hole, splashes down into the fecal matter and sees
that there are already children there. His face speckled with brown, the boy
looks dejected as the children tell him to go away.<br /><br />It's disturbing scenes like this that make Schindler's List all the most
realistic. Violence is abundant, especially in the liquidation of the ghetto
scene. My mother was watching with me but then left, claiming it was too
hard for her to watch. It is hard, but she seemed to think that the movie
was made to exploit the horrors that the Jews were submitted to. It was not.
It was to sensibilize the viewer to these. You hear about that in History
class, but by the time you're out of school, you forget. Schindler's List is
here for that purpose.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is extremely good as Schindler. He completely masks his Irish
accent and subtly portrays the change of mind that Schindler takes. Truly,
he was meant for the role and I can see no one else in the part. Ben
Kingsley does an admirable job as Schindler's friend and conscience. He
plays the perfect squire, the one who's a bit lower but just as important.
Ralph Fiennes, as Amon Goeth, is frighteningly convincing. When an actor can
bring onscreen a character with no feelings, a cold , unfeeling husk and
still make it look believable, it's admirable indeed. The extras are all
very good, and there are a LOT of them. <br /><br />If there's one thing that I did not like about Schindler's List, it is that
this is a hard movie to get into. At first I began watching it, and I never
really felt like watching it. It's not that the beginning is bad, it's that
you have the feeling that maybe you don't want to see what happens to
them.<br /><br />Schindler's List is a movie about a man. A man who changed history,
probably. A man who felt, and a man who gave hope. In one scene, Schindler
sprays the Jews that are cramped inside a train with cold water. He puts
more and more water in them and they gulp it up. A Nazi officer laughs and
says &quot;Ah, that's cruel. Stop, you're giving them hope.&quot; Schindler's List is
just that: a movie about hope. 10/10
