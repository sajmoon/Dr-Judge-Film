Everyone needs a slap in the face once in awhile to jar their
senses...and this movie was that slap for me. I needed to be jarred
awake from my apathy over the events of the Holocaust. In 1993 I got
that awakening thanks to this film by Spielberg.<br /><br />This is probably one of the most graphic and compelling accounts from a
Nazi death camp, juxtaposed to more modern fare, say &#x22;The Boy in
Striped Pajamas&#x22; which left me very disappointed and unmoved.<br /><br />Schindler was very moving. It made me cry. At times the images shocked
me enough to want to look away, but I did not. I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes
off the screen. I loved the use of black and white film, except where
the color red was splashed in (i.e. the little girls coat at the
beginning).<br /><br />I&#x27;ve made it an annual ritual to rent this film and watch it. And when
my daughters get old enough, they&#x27;ll join me in this important ritual.
Never again will I get apathetic towards the horrors of the Holocaust.<br /><br />chris http://holokauston.wordpress.com
