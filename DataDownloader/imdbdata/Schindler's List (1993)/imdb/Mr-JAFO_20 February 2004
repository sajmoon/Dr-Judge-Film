I must confess that when I first saw this film in theater, and the
followin'
few times I saw it on TV, I became a passionate defender of it and so I
tried 2 tell everybody who asked me Y I liked it. But, in time, I became
disappointed: the film is good, compared with the trash we're accustomed 2
watch these days (&amp; almost all last decade), but it doesn't deserve the
consideration of an &quot;All-Time Classic&quot;, because it isn't. It's a
subjective
story told from a personal &amp; subjective point of view (Steven Spielberg is
Jew), &amp; it tries 2 emphasize the violent side of it, but payin' few
attention 2 anything else. Some scenes R disconnected from the rest of the
plot, it contains nudity &amp; sex scenes that don't fit 2 the tale (sexual
relationships among Mr. &amp; Ms. Schindler, between Amon G&ouml;th &amp; her lover) &amp;
make the movie become rather vulgar instead of true classic. It's got
sometimes the taste of a documentary, but the connection between the
general
scenes &amp; the fictional (particular) ones is not very well made. The
violent
scenes (especially shootin') R too explicit (there's no need 2 place a
camera &amp; stop it above a dead body bleedin' 4 showin' us the crimes that
were committed). The idea of shootin' the film in B&amp;W, I think it's
actually
because that was very &quot;in&quot; those years &amp; it only took a good excuse 2 do
it.
If Spielberg really wanted 2 make a rigor approach 2 the matter the same
way
it was told by those media, he would have also made the film with analog
Mono sound, &amp; with less explicit violence. Definitely, watch it if U want,
but don't expect a timeless classic.
