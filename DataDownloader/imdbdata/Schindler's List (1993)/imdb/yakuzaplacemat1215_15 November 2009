English is not my first language but oh well , I wanna write this
review anyway! I read many reviewers say about the inacuracy of
Spilburg&#x27;s story. Personally I think &#x22;Who gives a sh...t about that&#x22;?
The message of the movie is &#x22;Spilburg saved lots of jews&#x22; ...This is
all We wanted to learn.<br /><br />Some reviewers were saying that...Schindler saved jews for his own
benefit (I think that is not true anyway). Even if that is true
.....again ... &#x22;Who gives a shi....t if he saved jews for his own
benefit . Not one of Spilburg&#x27;s books, speeches or articles, not one
paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an
accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are
completely worthless as history, because Spilburg cannot be trusted
anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is
talking or writing about. ... if we mean by historian someone who is
concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate
a representation of it as possible, then, ....Maybe in this life I
would never know a man named &#x22;SPILBERG&#x22; Anyway, enough with my horrible
English. Last thing I wanna say is ...THIS MOVIE IS GREAT! WATCH IT
!!!! YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH FROM THE MOVIE!
