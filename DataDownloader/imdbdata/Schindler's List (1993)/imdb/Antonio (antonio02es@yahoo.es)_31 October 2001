I liked this movie since the first time I saw it. I didn&acute;t understand how
the director who made E.T., Jaws or Raiders of the Lost Ark would made in
1993 the film that proves all his talent.
Schindler&acute;s List is a beautiful film in Black and White (a thing that
surprised in the 90&acute;s) and was the best movie in the OSCAR AWARDS.<br /><br />Pros: Acting (Ben Kingsley, and Liam Neeson too), the photography, the
soundtrack by John Williams, the realistic holocaust scenes and the
running
time of the film. It isn&acute;t be told in lesser time.
Cons: You feel sad at very moments.
I gave this film 10/10
Or for the stars system: *****/*****
