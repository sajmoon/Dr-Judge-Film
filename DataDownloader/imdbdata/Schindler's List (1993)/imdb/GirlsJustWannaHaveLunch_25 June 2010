Paraphrasing &#x22;I could&#x27;ve done more&#x22; has to be one of the most
heartbreaking lines of dialogue in not only this movie, but any movie.
It sums up the world&#x27;s feelings and regrets for not having done more.
It is a regret that we will always live with, voiced very eloquently by
Neeson.<br /><br />By far Spielberg&#x27;s most powerful film and shows truly what a master of
his craft he truly is. The black and white felt like all that old
concentration camp footage we have seen over the years giving it that
realism that made it even more uncomfortable too watch. <br /><br />Fiennes performance was dynamic from monster to person to monster. it
makes us wonder how people can become this way. Are they truly evil or
not even realize that they are evil. Or is that this biggest form of
absolute evil?<br /><br />The film&#x27;s running length seems to breeze by, although every moment
feels completely heavy. I cannot think of another film that has ever
had such an effect.<br /><br />this is something that should be shown in every school as a mandatory
requirement.<br /><br />May we never forget.
