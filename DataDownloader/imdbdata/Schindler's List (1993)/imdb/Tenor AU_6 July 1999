This is, by far, the greatest movie ever made. The emotion conveyed in
every
scene is so palpable, it's difficult to watch in one sitting.
The acting is incredible- Ralph Fiennes delivers one of the single
greatest
performances in acting history, while Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley deliver
their own unparalleled excellence.
Steven Spielberg's directing for this movie is unprecedented- the use of
black and white (with only two elements of the film appearing in color)
delivers the message even more clearly than color would have. The script
is
sensational- I cannot think of any aspect of this film that is not
incredible. Nothing compares with the power of Schindler's
List.
