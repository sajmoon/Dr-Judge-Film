Spielberg created a masterpiece.  The movie is not an easy one to watch,
because it's so grim, but that's appropriate when you're doing a Holocaust
film.  The fact that it's in black and white adds to the
grimness.<br /><br />The graphic violence in &quot;Schindler's List&quot; actually has a purpose, unlike so
many gory movies.  He's trying to capture the living hell that the Jews in
the concentration camp went through.  I wouldn't advise letting preteens see
it, but in high school it would be good for all kids to view.
