This is a truly stunning piece of work. It is like seeing a piece of
history
as it happened. It is horrifying and at the same time, humbling. Few films
have the power to make an impact on your mind and to influence your
thoughts
as much as this does. A gripping, frightening and unforgettable
experience... You'll keep thinking about it for days...
