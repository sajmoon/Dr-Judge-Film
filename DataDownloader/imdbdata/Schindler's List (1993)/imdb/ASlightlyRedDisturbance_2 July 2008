Well, first of all, this is not my usual type of film. I don&#39;t like
watching such realistic films, since they really depress me. But since
this is a universally acclaimed Oscar-winner, I decided to see it.<br /><br />This is a very realistic film. It deplicits the horror that Polish Jews
went through, and I have never seen a film with such power. The film, I
was glad, did not start off suddenly with the Jews, and throughout the
film, we are able to look into characters&#39; emotions and minds. A lot of
character are seen in this film, and they are given development, so we
can actually care about them. There were a lot of actors involved in
this film, and the main actors, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben
Kingsley, all do great jobs. They each make their characters unique.
They each give their whole into it.<br /><br />The film has a lot to deal with. It really is a &#39;grand&#39; film. The
productions and the cost of all the actors and stunts must have been
hard. In those scenes, scenes that we are able to see how disturbing
Jews lived, those scenes are amazing. There are a lot of powerful ones,
and we can surely distinguish them. The cinematography is simply
amazing. Some of the best I have ever seen, the use of the camera, and
the pacing etc. This is a very technical achievement as well. It really
did look like we were witnessing real persons being tortured.<br /><br />Overall, this is simply a masterpiece. Yes, I thought it was a bit
long. I actually felt a little restless in parts, and sort of dull, but
I still recognized the achievement, and although I couldn&#39;t really
follow in all the dialogue, I still appreciated it. That is what a
masterpiece is. A work or art, a work of realism to give the audience.
Everyone should see this film. You cannot help but feel a little
distraught for all these people. The ending scene, with the actors
walking with their real-life character portrayals, was simply
emotional. It really gets to you. It is simply Steven Spielberg&#39;s
greatest work he ever made.
