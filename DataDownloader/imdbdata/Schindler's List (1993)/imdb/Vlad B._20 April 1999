This grandiose opus Spielberg directed to cement his name as a &quot;serious&quot;
filmmaker, stands in a very dubious position : its very subject is so sacred
and untouchable to the civilized world (including film critics), that
questioning the film's integrity as of late has been almost equated to
denying the Holocaust itself. The truth, however is bitter: &quot;Schindler's
List&quot; is far from perfect. Spielberg, previously known for his
family-oriented, gawking adventure yarns that usually were as far away from
tangible reality as possible, indeed has surprised everyone with the
heartwrenching brutality of the Jewish victims' suffering, which he vividly
depicts. The most powerful scenes in the film work on a purely instinctive
level: they're silent and do not involve familiar individuals, they play
almost like some perversely voyeuristic yet priceless footage of Nazi
atrocities. The wisely chosen, eloquent black and white cinematography is a
definite highlight. Everything else, for the most part, has Spielberg at his
old game: he was always best at spectacle, and worst at character
development. A dozen or so Jews are singled out as &quot;types&quot;, and are traced
throughout the film. In over three hours, we learn absolutely nothing about
them, they're merely sheep to be saved by Schindler. The man himself is
provided with almost no real explanation for his change from an
opportunistic slaveowner to a righteous saint-like figure. In the last ten
minutes, he simply steps out of character and lapses into a stagy farewell;
seductively tearjerking, but completely out of place in a movie that aspires
to an authentic representation of the Holocaust. The only character that
even begins to approach three-dimensionality is the local Nazi henchman ,
(Ralph Fineness), one of the most interesting portrayals of a villain in
recent cinema. Despite its considerable problems, &quot;Schinler's list&quot; is still
widely used to introduce the new, unsophisticated audience to the
mid-twentieth century horrors: whether or not is should be, remains open to
debate.
