I would say its one of the most beautifully filmed movies I&#x27;ve ever
seen, except that its hell.<br /><br />You&#x27;re looking At hell.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes performance is perfect.<br /><br />This disturbs me to the core. This may be one of the most important
films you will ever see It is certainly one of the most important films
ever made. <br /><br />And I applaud Spielberg. For using all the powers at his disposal for
creating this film for the world.<br /><br />Thank You.
