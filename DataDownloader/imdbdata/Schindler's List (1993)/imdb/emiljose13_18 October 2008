Schindler&#39;s list is a very powerful and emotional portrayal of the
Holocaust and no other films or documentaries have portrayed the
sufferings of the Holocaust in such fine detail. It is beautifully
directed film with some incredible performance(Liam Neeson, Ben
Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes) including with the soundtrack of John Williams
which is another aspect of the film that is beautifully done. there can
be no errors found in this film and is such a powerful and moving film
that should appeal to any adult.<br /><br />This film is surely on my top ten, might even be my second favourite
film of all time!!!! Overall this film is a masterpiece and will be
remembered for ever as an epic Steven Spielberg directed.
