To say that you don't like Speilberg is almost unamerican, certain to get
you dismissed as an arty naysayer.  How could you not love Jaws, Raiders of
the Lost Ark, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Schindler's
List?<br /><br />Indeed, how could you not.  They are all honed and perfected in every
possible way.  Anything that you might not enjoy, that might not contribute
to your complete and utter passive entertainment, has been sandpapered away,
leaving a smooth, coated lozenge of American moviemaking.  They are
perfection personified.<br /><br />And while that makes these films impossible to hate, it also makes them
impossible to love, at least in the way that I love movies.  I want my
favorite films to push back, to argue with me, and with themselves.  What
has been lost in the process of perfection is personality, the willingness
to fail, to be boring, or slow, or stupid, or half-baked.  To write a line
of bad dialogue, to cut a scene too short or too long.  To risk an ugly shot
in search of a mind blowing one, or to move the camera and risk a shaky
scene.  Godard, the anti Speilberg if there ever was one, did all of these
things over and over.  To watch a Godard film, even a truly awful one (and
there were quite a few), is thrilling.  To watch a bad Speilberg film (say,
1941) is numbing and unbearable, as the lack of personality simply shines
through.<br /><br />And then there is Schindler's List, Speilberg's 'art' film.  Visually, it
makes all manner of stylistic references to everyone from Kurosawa to
Bergman (two decidely risk taking filmmakers), but spiritually it's closer
in spirit to Lean's Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago, 'quality' films
where even the beauty is stifling.  It seems designed, much like his action
blockbusters, so that there is nothing bad you can say about it.  Great
photography abounds, but never in a way that makes you want to sit up and
notice.  It's like a series of postcards from the holocaust.   It's
emotionally wrenching, at times, but never in a way that demands that you
become uncomfortable.  And it builds up to a treacly ending that rings so
false that it's almost embarrassing.<br /><br />So there you go.  I'm sure I've made some people hate me, but so be it.
