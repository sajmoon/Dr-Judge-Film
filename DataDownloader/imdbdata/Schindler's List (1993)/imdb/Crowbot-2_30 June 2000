Words cannot describe the feeling I have towards this movie.  Having family
member ancestry of both sides of the war I thought it was important to watch
this movie to get my information straghtened out.  This is the first movie
ever to bring me to tears.  Beautifully carved out to a document type
feeling.  Note of trivia: Steven Spieldberg went home crying everyday crying
during production.  I don't blame him.
