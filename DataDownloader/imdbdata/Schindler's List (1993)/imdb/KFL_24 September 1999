This is, after all, one of the more...for lack of a better
word...*necessary* films to appear in recent years. Yes, humans can fall to
such depths. Yes, such rampant disregard for all we hold sacred--for life,
for simple virtues--is possible. Yes, such bestiality has been, is today,
will be again.
...entertaining??? Perish the thought. Nothing, absolutely NOTHING about
this movie is entertaining. If you want entertainment this evening, watch
something else. A Cary Grant comedy, a Mel Brooks film...anything
else.<br /><br />But this is, when all is said and done, one of the most important films ever
made...because it tells us something we need very much to know, or to
remember:  On your guard! There have always been, will always be more Amon
Goethes!! There will always be more Auschwitzes! ...but will I have the
courage to be another Oskar Schindler??
