&quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; can best be described as something more than a
movie. It is a cinematic exhibit and memorial dedicated to the heroism
of Oskar Schindler and the 6 million plus Jews that died in the
Holocaust. But don&#39;t cheat the film aspect either: this film is
brilliantly made and intelligently put together. It is beautiful,
smart, touching, haunting and inspiring.<br /><br />The story is in essence about how Schindler was touched somehow to use
his position as a factory director to keep Jews from being exterminated
in Auschwitz. The film uses a brilliant non-verbal method to offer
reasons why Schindler did what he did. In addition, the film also
serves as a historical telling of the events that occurred to a portion
of the millions who died or experienced the Holocaust.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is very strong as Schindler. He doesn&#39;t seem all too warm
and lovable at first, but eventually you take to him and see him become
the hero he was. Ralph Fiennes gives a performance as the Nazi
commander Amon Goeth that is simply chilling. Ben Kingsley as
Schindler&#39;s assistant Yitzchak Stern also adds a great, simple, modest
character.<br /><br />From the technical aspect, John Williams&#39; score is beautiful. The theme
is both tragic and hopeful and it&#39;s incredible that Yitzchak Pearlman
was included in it as the solo violinist. The black and white work (the
team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski strike again) is beautiful and
thoroughly conceived.<br /><br />&quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; is both educational and inspirational. Entertaining
does not quite fit in the realm of an appropriate description. It is an
experience.
