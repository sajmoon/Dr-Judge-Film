In many cases, I have found that Steven Spielberg movies, while usually
very good for sitting in a theater and enjoying were never really my
kind of thing. I bought this movie on a hunch that this one would be
different. Well, it really wasn't, but I can't deny the absolute
perfection of such a blatantly Hollywood movie. In typical Spielbergian
fashion, the movie lifts you up and throws you down throughout, but
never enough to make you very happy or sad, but at the end... The end
is where the real kick is. I've never seen such a blatantly obvious
attempt to make a person cry, but, even though I tried not to, I still
did. It was an impossible temptation to escape. Sure it's propaganda,
sure it's a Hollywood, ends happy, leaves you with a good feeling
inside type of movie, but it was still more powerful than many other
movies could even try to be.
