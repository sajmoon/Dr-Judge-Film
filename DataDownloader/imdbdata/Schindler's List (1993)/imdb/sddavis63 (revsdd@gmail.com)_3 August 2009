This movie must be the best piece of work dealing with the Holocaust
that I have ever seen. The only criticism I can find myself making of
it is that it was a little bit confusing in the first hour or so, but
even that was probably appropriate as the movie portrays a time of
chaos anyway. The first thing that one notices is the decision to film
the movie in black and white. That was a brilliant decision. Somehow,
it gives the story greater power. The brutality of the Holocaust is
obvious, the sadistic nature of the SS is portrayed brilliantly, both
in depictions of actual events and by Ralph Fiennes in his portrayal of
SS officer Amon Goeth, the confusion and uncertainty and desperation of
the Jews is palpable. Everything is raw with power. I would have liked
some greater explanation of the impact of the little girl who provides
the only splashes of colour in the movie (she&#x27;s dressed in red) on
Schindler. She&#x27;s hardly the only child he sees suffer. Why her in
particular?<br /><br />Ben Kingsley&#x27;s portrayal of Itzhak Stern, the Jewish accountant
recruited by Schindler to run his business is appropriately low-key.
Here was a man who saw an opportunity to help his fellow Jews through
Schindler&#x27;s company and who quietly took advantage of it. Which brings
me to Liam Neeson&#x27;s portrayal of Schindler. He did a great job -
completely believable as he portrays Schindler&#x27;s evolution from a
businessman who just wanted to make money and who brought Jews into his
factory for no reason except that they were the cheapest labour
available to a man determined to protect his Jewish workers from the
insanity and horror of Auschwitz. The closing scene, as he breaks down
crying out that he feels he should have saved more people, is one of
the most powerful and moving scenes I have ever seen in a movie,
especially as Stern quietly comforts him and says &#x22;no - you did so
much&#x22; and the other Jews he saved rush up to embrace and comfort him.
It was also moving to see the Schindler Jews honouring his grave at the
end of the movie. <br /><br />Schindler provides the inspiration here. Yes, it&#x27;s inspiring that he
saved 1200 Jews, but the inspiration goes beyond that. As the story
makes clear, Schindler was largely a failure at everything he did in
life, both before and after the war. And yet, this man - who was (I
hate to use the word, but it&#x27;s pretty much true) a loser - managed to
rise to what must have seemed an insurmountable challenge and
accomplished something great of historic proportions. If a man like
Schindler could do this, surely others can do it too - not with respect
to the Holocaust anymore (thank God!) but with some of the other issues
in the world today. This is truly a brilliant piece of work. 9/10
