Ever since I found out about the persecution of Jews by Hitler, I have
felt
very strongly about the Holocaust and when I discovered we were going to
be
watching Schindler's List in my History class (I am in Year 9), I thought
it
would be very interesting.
It was, and all the way through, it felt so real; I know it is a true
story,
but it doesn't automatically make it seem real; but this film was almost
too
real; how can people have ever done this?
I actually cried at a lot of points, and this is because the film is so
well
made; Steven Spielburg has excelled himself. You see this film almost as
though you were one of the Jews that Schindler saved.<br /><br />This is one of the best films I have ever seen; and it really touched me;
I
recommend it to anyone.
