The problem with 'Schindler's List' is that, although superbly made by
one of the most talented directors who ever lived, it has an agenda: to
convince people of the Holocaust. I mean, why add all those dramatic
scenes of children being led to their deaths, the gassings, bodies
burning etc? What did all that add to the film story apart from try to
shock the viewers? Schindler himself was, in reality, far removed from
the nice man portrayed by Liam Neeson. Most of what he did was not
because he particularly cared about the Jews, but because they made him
lots of money. He was also a serial womaniser and adulterer. Basically,
the film is a sentimental Hollywood melodrama which happens to be set
at a time of great cruelty, motivated by blind fanaticism. An
opportunity was lost to analyse WHY the Nazis hated Jews so much, what
were the fundamental roots of the German-Jewish conflict? Instead
Spielberg went for the safe option of creating brutal German robots and
innocent, perplexed Jewish victims. And the final scene when Schindler
gave his speech was frankly ridiculous. Final verdict: magnificent
film, subject matter not properly presented.
