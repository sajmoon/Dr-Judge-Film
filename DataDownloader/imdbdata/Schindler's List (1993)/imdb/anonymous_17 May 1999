An extremely difficult subject done to near perfection by a director
no-one
would previously have thought capable of this level of expression.  All
style choices complemented the subject matter perfectly, and the film
veered
away from the mawkish to leave real emotions.  The colourised coat has
been
criticised, but there is really no other way to show the individual
tragedies of the holocaust so well.  Lifetime best performances are given
by
all of the leads, Neeson in particular giving a magnificent portrayal of
Schindler's moral conversion.  Spielberg uses the medium to the limit, to
create a lasting and moving testament to those who died.
