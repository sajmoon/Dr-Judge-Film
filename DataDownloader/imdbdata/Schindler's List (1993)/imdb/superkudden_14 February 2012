Oscar Schindler was an unknown person, until this movie came. Schindler
was one of the most powerful men during World War 2. He saved 1100
Jews, this is the movie about him. The movie starts out in black and
white. <br /><br />Schindlers List, is a very touching movie, and the best movie I will
ever see. I cried, and it is very exciting to. Ben Kinglsey, Liam
Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are all great in this one, I couldn&#x27;t imagine
anyone else playing these characters. I can recommend this movie to
anyone, it is really recorded good also. I know its over three hours,
but you will never get bored of this film, trust me, and Im not a Jew
just because I love this movie.
