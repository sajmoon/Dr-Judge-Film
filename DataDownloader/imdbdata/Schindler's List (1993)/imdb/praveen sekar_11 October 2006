When I first learnt about Schindler&#39;s list, I had great expectations on
how Spielberg would have made the greatest ever human tragedy. I
expected big shots like Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann... but Spielberg had
made the movie with stern, Helen heitsh, schindler and goeth. When I
first saw the movie I thought Spielberg had missed quite a lot of
incidents. I thought some scenes in the first 1 hour could have been
cut to accommodate other incidents and I felt the movie was overrated.
But only after watching the movie a second time I realized that the
movie was &#39;Schindler&#39;s list&#39; and not a documentary on holocaust. I also
appreciated how important each and every scene was and got convinced
that there couldn&#39;t have been a better version of the movie. While
scenes like burning synagogues would have been sensational, It would
have provoked outrage. But Spielberg had given this movie an emotional
and human touch. Schindler&#39;s transformation from a corrupt flirt
profit-minded businessman to a great saviour has been fabulously
portrayed. This movie, though not a great tearjerker, has a lot of
emotional dialogues and scenes.<br /><br />Schindler viewing the ghetto liquidation from the top of a cliff,
Schindler&#39;s soothing words to helen, Schindler trying to change goeth
by telling about power,Schindler&#39;s talk to stern after orders on
special treatment, Schindler thinking on what to do one fine night,
Schindler saving the ladies and subsequently the children and many more
of these scenes simply break you to give a wet eyes. Observe Neeson&#39;s
body language on all these circumstances and you&#39;ll understand how
nobel a heart he was and what kindness actually means. The scene where
schindler gets furious with a Jewish woman and later brings her parents
to his factory is my best in the movie. Goeth&#39;s split personality was
frightening. The background score of music during the liquidation of
the ghetto was moving. The lead trio of Liam neeson, Ralph Fiennes and
Ben Kingsley have performed exceptionally well in the movie. Its quite
sad that none got an Oscar. Thank god that the Reich officials were
corrupt otherwise the Schindler Jews would have perished at Auschwitz
and the world would have missed this great masterpiece.
