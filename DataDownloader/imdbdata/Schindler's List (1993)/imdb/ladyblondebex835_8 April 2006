I have visited Krakow in Poland where the film was mainly made, the
atmosphere there was distressing and to be able to capture that equally
as emotive through a camera shows genius. I loved the entire film
straight through, it promises to draw tears every time without fail. A
must see. The film also portrays the sadness of the camps better than
being in the camp in person; i have been to auschwitz and berkenau
myself. I think Neeson plays schindler excellently, he has the charm to
demonstrate the real Schindlers nature with women. I also thought at
first that black and white films were not appreciated in the modern
age, however, this film shows that black and white can work, you would
not get the same effect from the film if it were in colour.
