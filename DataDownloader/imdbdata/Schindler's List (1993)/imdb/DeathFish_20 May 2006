Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. What more can I say? . It takes total
control of your emotions: Sorrow, sadness, hate, hope and even
sometimes joy in the few happy scenes. The actors and actress&#39;complete
this masterwork of a movie with absolute amazing performances. It
follows the historical facts very careful and makes you believe that it
happened almost as in the movie. A movie that makes you cry every time
you see it, if not on the outside, at least on the inside. It touches
your soul, even if you do not think it is the best movie in the world.
Well the 6th place speaks for itself, this is without doubt one of the
best movies ever! I like it so much because it captures the true
effects of the war and the killing of all the million Jews. It shows
how a single man helped hundreds to live through and keep fighting.
Steven Spielberg uses all means to make it one of the greatest movies
in the world.
