There are some movies that are so good,realistic and sad that it is
hard for me to re-watch them. This is one.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t watched this since and probably won&#39;t ever. Its just to
difficult to watch the torture and sufferings of a people as superbly
displayed in this movie.<br /><br />Its about a German officer who saves Jews from the holocaust and will
probably make you cry. Its hard to fathom how a people can be so cruel
to another people.<br /><br />If you haven&#39;t seen this movie you should. The acting is superb!<br /><br />And the historical reference is important to know.
