This and The Pianist are the best War/Holocaust films, that I have seen
and both deserve their recognition, both show how mistreated the Jews
were but also show how not all the Gremans were bad people, some were
good, and some helped the Jews to survive and prosper as a race.<br /><br />A clear must see for anyone, and a clear 8.5/10 from me, not a 9
because it&#x27;s not really my favourite genre.<br /><br />Brilliance of acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Feinnes, as well as Ben
Kingsley and all of the other major cast and extras. A brilliant
Spielberg film with direction, dialogue and shots as well as having a
very moving story line.
