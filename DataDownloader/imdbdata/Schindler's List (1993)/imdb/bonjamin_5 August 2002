Spielbergs renditions of the same film over and over again with the usual
disallusioned protagonist caught up in backdrop of supposedly threatening
results. Spielberg is a quick study and there's no doubt about it: He is a
child, depicting stories that clearly immitate life(well his anyway) and
this 'magnificant film' proclaimed so boldly by the masses represents
nothing but( as a noted critic said on its initial release) Indiana Jones
in
Krakow.
And thats not all ,despite about three hours of
over-elaborate,one-dimensional,black
and white(screenplay and cinematography) sentimentality that smacks of
indulgance( oh i didnt know what behold the jews in WW2!) We have to
endure
a shameless ending of direct manipulation.
Did well at the box-office (and the oscars, who seem content in handing
awards to dire rubbish,Forrest Gump,Braveheart and Titanic to name a few)
largely thanks to spielbergs bucket load of adoring fans who idolize the
boy
out of all proportion.<br /><br />
