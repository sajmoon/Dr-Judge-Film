I believe history will prove this film to be the single greatest
cinematic
work to be presented for public consumption.  It is a film that will
withstand the rigors of time itself.  Everyone should be shown this film
regardless of their stance on the subject matter.  This should be a
required
part of the school curriculum, and should be considered in the same vein as
the works of William Shakespeare.
This is a film that I have seen alter the life of not only myself, but
everyone that has seen it.  Bravo to the cast and crew!  Be assured that
this movie will lend you immortality.
