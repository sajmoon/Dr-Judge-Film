Some of Schindler&#x27;s List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic
images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is
very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the
movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi&#x27;s
treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some
of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make
you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg&#x27;s
movies are good, but don&#x27;t quite always have an impact on the whole
audience. Schindler&#x27;s List is visually disturbing and incredibly
moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg&#x27;s best. The
acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb
performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The
music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad,
believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly
moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox.
