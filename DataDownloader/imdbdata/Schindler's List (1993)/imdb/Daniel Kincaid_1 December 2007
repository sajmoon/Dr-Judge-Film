&quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; is Steven Spielberg&#39;s acclaimed film that explores
the life of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved almost
1,200 Jews during the Holocaust through his actions. Spielberg
appropriately decided to make the film in black and white, which gives
the film a documentary-like quality. It also allowed him to make
effective use of occasional glimpses of color. John Williams again
proves his ability to come up with an appropriate soundtrack for any
type of film. Spielberg also shows in a time of overwrought special
effects that effects can be used subtlety to great effect, such as the
zoomed out shot of a building on which windows light up to indicate
Nazi gunfire and killings.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is perfect as Oskar Schindler. Schindler is initially a war
profiteer who is eventually moved to use his fortune and influence to
shield Jews from the Holocaust. Interestingly the character was given
an enigmatic quality and generally isn&#39;t explicit about his perceptions
for a lot of the film. To the film&#39;s credit, it doesn&#39;t suppress the
womanizing aspect of Schindler&#39;s character. Ben Kingsley is also
excellent in a subtle performance as Schindler&#39;s invaluable accountant
and assistant, Itzhak Stern. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great and
frightening performance as the unstable and insecure megalomaniac Amon
Goeth.<br /><br />This film is long and sad, but absorbing at the same time such that it
is never tedious during its length of over three hours. The film gains
intensity from the graphic depictions of Nazi violence and the
lingering sense that Jews can be killed at any time. It also shows us
how the courage of one individual can have an important impact.
Schindler laments not having saved more people, but the film
effectively makes it clear that almost 1,200 people is an important
number.
