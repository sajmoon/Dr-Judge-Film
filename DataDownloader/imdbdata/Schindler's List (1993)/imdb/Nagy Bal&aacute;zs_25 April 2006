This MOVIE (with all big letters) is one of the most beautiful, and
horroristic pictures in the whole world. All of the actors have given
their most perfect and powerful performances in their filming career.
Ralph Fiennes gives us a breath-taking skill of being a lazy, brutal
and ruthless, but still a calculating commander of the Jewish camp, and
Ben Kingsley, who plays the accountant of Oskar Schindler, almost made
me cry (I never dropped tears for a film), when he gives his tenets up
(as a Jewish man, he can&#39;t drink alcoholic drink), and ask Schindler to
give him a whiskey. I think without John Williams&#39; music, this film
still could be good, but when you hear the Piano Theme, it will make
your soul heavy as a hammer, and you can&#39;t think about other things,
just the Cruel Reality of the World in the WW2. Steven Spielberg has
done a very-very good and exhaustive directing, with all the
Black-and-White effects he used and controlled, like a work of art.
This film grabs you, climb in your soul, and then won&#39;t get out of here
until you watch a better movie than this. (it&#39;s impossible). Howewer
the screen is black and white, the quality of sounds and the effects is
cutting edge, and you can fell that you&#39;re there next to Amon Goeth, or
one of the characters. But these words are nothing, you need to watch
this movie to recognize it&#39;s true meaning, otherwise, this comment is
nothing, it can&#39;t bring back the feeling of this picture, and you only
will know, how great film is this, when you watch it with your own
eyes. Congratulations, Steven Spielberg, you made an instant classic,
which is recommended for ALL people in the world, at least for an
one-time view with it&#39;s three hour playtime, but when you watch it, you
grow up. Suddenly, for ever.
