At the time of this film&#x27;s release, while he was the undisputed
commercial king of cinema, Steven Spielberg had never been considered a
&#x27;serious&#x27; film-maker. With the exception of The Colour Purple he was
known as a director of big-budget B-pictures. Many people criticized
his films for being too syrupy and child-like. With the notable
exceptions of Duel and Jaws this wasn&#x27;t necessarily an unfair
assessment. While his vision was unerringly on the pulse of the
mainstream, it rarely had any edge whatsoever. So with the release of
Schindler&#x27;s List, Spielberg was able to offer something pretty bleak
and hard-hitting. He was also rewarded at the Academy Awards, which was
another thing he craved desperately.<br /><br />The book by Thomas Keneally from which the film was adapted is a
masterful and deeply disturbing account of true events in Nazi occupied
Poland. It takes a documentary approach to events, as it is all from
real accounts. It was, therefore, the sort of novel that had to be
treated with the utmost respect if it was to be translated to the
screen with any success. It has to be said that Spielberg was largely
very successful in this challenge, and his film remains a powerful
telling of this most harrowing, if ultimately uplifting, of tales. He
wisely decided to film it in stark black and white which lends an
immediate bleakness to proceedings and recalls old footage from the
Second World War. When he does decide to inject a bit of colour, as in
the little girl in the red coat, it works in bringing out the appalling
tragedy of this little girl&#x27;s life even more &#x96; it doesn&#x27;t seem
gimmicky. Another major plus for the film is in the performances. Liam
Neeson has the right blend of charisma and humanity as Oskar Schindler
but best of all is Ralph Fiennes as the camp commandant Amon Goeth; he
played this character with extreme skill and brought to the screen a
strangely complex presence. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t go as far as to say
Fiennes&#x27;s Goeth was sympathetic &#x96; he was vile &#x96; but his underlying
impulses and insecurities had interesting depth to say the least.<br /><br />On the whole Spielberg handles things very well here. His trademark
schmaltz is thankfully absent, and he does not hold back when he needs
to ramp things up and show atrocities. Quite often Schindler&#x27;s List is
very unpleasant, and the director wisely doesn&#x27;t sugar-coat things. The
only place where he breaks is in Schindler&#x27;s closing speech at the
factory. This moment was melodramatic and totally unnecessary. The
events depicted up to that point had been faithfully told from a
historical point-of-view and they did not need that invented moment of
emotional manipulation; what had gone before spoke for itself. This
minor slip-up aside, Schindler&#x27;s List did prove that Spielberg was
capable to making serious films when he put his mind to it.
