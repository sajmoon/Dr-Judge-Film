Everyone who loves freedom and despises hatred and discrimination should
watch this movie. It's one of the sadest movies I've ever seen, but I
loved
it anyway, Mr. Spielberg is a genius. The whole idea of making the film in
black and white was incredible. And then when that one girl Schindler is
watching is in color it, wow, is all I can say. The youth of America needs
to see this movie and see what hatred and tyranny can do to people and our
youth would be grateful they live in the United States of America.
