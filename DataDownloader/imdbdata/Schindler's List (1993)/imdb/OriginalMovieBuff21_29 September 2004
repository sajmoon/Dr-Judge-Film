Schindler's List is one of the most touching films of all-time. The
acting, cinematography, story, screenplay , directing, and just well
everything is amazing in this portrayal of the Holocaust. The film was
very powerful and some scenes just shocked you, that's how great this
movie really is. Very emotional also and that girl with the red stuff
on walking through the streets was very touching and emotional. The
whole film is kind of based on that. This one of the best films ever
made and one of Steven Spielberg's best, this movie really is that
amazing. <br /><br />Hedeen's outlook: 10/10!! **** A+
