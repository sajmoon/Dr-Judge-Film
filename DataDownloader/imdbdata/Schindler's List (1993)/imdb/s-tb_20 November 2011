This movie, Schindler&#x27;s List, is hands-down without a doubt one of the
greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Regardless of
how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it
deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my
stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and
It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life. Schindler&#x27;s List is a grim portrayal of events
in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to
some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually
started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie.
I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of
movies. Outstanding.
