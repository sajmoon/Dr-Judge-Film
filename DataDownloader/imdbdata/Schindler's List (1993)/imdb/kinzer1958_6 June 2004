This movies should be mandatory for high school and collage students.
They could replace Greek mythology and teach real history. History they
we should never forget. Schindler's List!!! The movie has a very
powerful story. The facts are backed up with hours of interviews from
the survivors. The pictures and story that cannot be put into words has
made it to the screen for everyone to learn from. If you know someone
that has not experienced this movie. Make sure they see it even if you
have to rent it for them. Our family has watched it at least 8 times I
never tire from it. Each time I learn something new. And now the box
set is the Best with so many extras. Our school library's should keep
this in all US school from JR&gt;High on.
