Everyday people make selfish choices that impact the world around them.
In rare cases, random acts of selfishness end up making a positive
difference. Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Oscar winning movie &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;
uses the true story of Oskar Schindler to exemplify just that.
Brilliantly, Spielberg captures the human condition in a story which is
sure to win our hearts, and make us reflect the impact simple choices
make in the world. <br /><br />Throughout the movie, Spielberg eloquently evokes the audience to
ponder the costs of human life, and the questions that arise as a
result. At exactly what point does money not matter anymore? How much
suffering should people endure before enough is enough? And is it
possible to overcome something as horrific as reducing the value of
someone&#x27;s life to the degree the Holocaust did? <br /><br />Set in World War II, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) opens a factory to
cash in on the cheap slave labor of the Jewish people. Enlisting the
help of a Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), Schindler
procures concentration camp prisoners to work for him in his factory,
at little to no cost to his business. Stern begins to save his family
and friends from the horrors of Nazi Concentration Camps because of
Schindler&#x27;s initial blindness by prospective money. As his work force
rises, Schindler becomes extremely wealthy on the backs of his Jewish
workers. Eventually, Schindler cannot ignore the horrors of the
Holocaust, causing his cheap price of slave labor to no longer exceed
the cost of Jewish lives. Thus, Schindler creates a list of prisoners
to protect from the gas chambers, and convinces Nazi soldiers to keep
those people alive. But is it too late? <br /><br />Neeson&#x27;s portrayal of Oskar Schindler could not be any better. Neeson
strikes the perfect balance between his disinterest and profiteering at
the beginning with his compassion and humility at the end. He engages
the audience so effortlessly; it is as if we are looking into his mind.
Neeson flawlessly exemplifies how simple choices can affect the world
around us.
