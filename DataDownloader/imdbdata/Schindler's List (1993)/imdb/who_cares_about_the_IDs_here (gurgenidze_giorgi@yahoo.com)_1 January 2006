watching this excellent movie, i was realizing that i was watching
thing that i will like on 100%! I was amazed when i was watching the
beautiful capturing of each moments, great words, great and the perfect
directing! This movie is the film that will journey through the times
of the future and the past! It's black and white and it's splendid,
it's relishing us from inside, it's long but it is that much
interesting that i could never imagine! and the last when i saw the
girl in red, a little running girl in red in that black white movie i
was crying! I couldn't stop and the last moments when the Schindler's
People are approaching, and coming through black horizon and the whole
picture is becoming color i was shocked, it's perfectly made! and the
moment when they are taken to the bath room, yes that moment made me
cry again! it's the best Hollywood movie about the War World II! and
Spielberg is the greatest directors in the entire world! i just bow, i
just cry and i just, you know, i can't find any word to tell you my
feelings!!! IT IS THE Great MOVIE!!! (maybe not my favor but it's have
the notable place in my mind)
