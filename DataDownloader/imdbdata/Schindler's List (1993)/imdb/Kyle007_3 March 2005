First of all it is a reminder of the crimes committed in the times of
World war II, and second it is a homage to Schindler, something that he
really deserved and he wasn't always recognized for what he did.<br /><br />At the beginning of the story, Schindler is with no doubt another Nazi,
with the same mentality of them, and so he decides to take double
advantage of the war, not only manufacturing things for the armies but
also hiring Jews to pay them less than he should , so his benefits were
going to be spectacular, he really makes lots of money doing so, but
with the course of the war he sees with his own eyes what was actually
happening to the Jews and he begins to change his mind about that, it
is true that the character played by Ben Kingsley helps to the change
even though with a low profile, so that's when he realizes that he can
save people instead of taking advantage of them, how? When he hires
Jews he is automatically saving them from death, so he does so, but
only in secret he knows the real reason of Jew-hiring otherwise, he
would be accused of betrayal against the Germany.He even gets to pay
money to the Nazi's to hire Jews, and that's when he makes a sacrifice
and invests the money he made from the war, and so he proofs once again
why he is worthy of acknowledgement.<br /><br />All that is about the plot, but i have to say that the way Spielberg
carries the story is really interesting and makes you stay still in
front of the TV, he shows us a view of World War II from another
perspective than the traditional of the battles, it shows us how much
that group of people suffered in that particular period of history and
why we shouldn't forget the past to don't make the same mistakes in a
future.<br /><br />First, when the movie is just beginning you wonder why is it in black
and white, but then you realize it is some kind of history lesson, and
Spielberg didn't actually need the colour for this movie, it had no
special effects and was focused in the plot, and the development of it.
In this movie he demonstrated why Cinema is considered as another art.<br /><br />For all this is that this movie deserves to be with the greatests
movies ever, and mainly because the story told is true and no fiction.
