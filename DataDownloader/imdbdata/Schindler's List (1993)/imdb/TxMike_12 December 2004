I'll start with an &quot;aside.&quot; What is a &quot;film&quot; and what is a &quot;movie.&quot; I
take the logical stance most of the time, the crew &quot;films&quot; so that the
director and editor can create a &quot;movie&quot;. But I have a difficult time
thinking of &quot;Schindler's List&quot; as a &quot;movie.&quot; I didn't watch it to be
entertained, no person with a clear vision of the history behind it
would. So for me, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is certainly a &quot;film&quot;, one about a
real stain on our human history, a stain placed there solely from
religious beliefs. The persecution and attempted extermination of the
Jews by the German Nazis.<br /><br />But this &quot;film&quot;, while its overall subject is the holocaust, is not
really about the holocaust. While it revolves around the mistreatment
of Jews by the Nazis, it is about the man, Oskar Schindler, played by
Liam Neeson. A German, a &quot;connected&quot; man in society, he went to Poland
and bought a factory, employing cheap Jewish labor, hoping to get rich.
He was no humanitarian. But perhaps his biggest weakness, his not being
an astute businessman, was responsible for the conversion we see during
the course of the three hours running time of the film. He has to rely
on a Jew, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), to run his factory. And the
rest, as they say, is history. He changes to the point that he risks
his own life to save many, perhaps over 1000, Jews from extermination,
no longer for profit but for true humanitarian motives.<br /><br />Unique in this time of modern movie-making, this film is mostly in
Black and white. For me this works very well, because first it is such
a stark subject and second, there is not so much to distract the viewer
from the story. Many consider this Spielberg's best directorial effort,
probably because as a Jew it was very personal to him. As a viewer,
many times I found it difficult to watch, because the scenes are so
realistic. I will never forget the scenes of nude prisoners being
marched across the prison grounds to their deaths. I give great credit
for this film's place in history, but it is not one that I enjoy
watching, it is such a reminder how some can be so cruel to those who
should be treated as our brothers and sisters.
