One thousand words, the maximum for this review, are hardly enough to
describe the direct impact this film had on me as well as some of my
friends.  Spielberg does a wonderful job depicting the harsh reality of
Jewish Life back in the early 1940's.  I vaguely remember one of his
comments before the first commercial free showing of this film on NBC:  &quot;We
must not forget the tragedy these Jews had to endure...&quot;  I am thoroughly
convinced that I will never ever forget this movie now or 50 years from
now.
Schindler's List is powerful in direction, hypnotic in nature, and perfect
in form.  One of the best films of all time, if not THE best.  Simply a
great work, well deserving of all of its Oscars, especially Best Picture.
I
applaud you, Mr. Spielberg.
