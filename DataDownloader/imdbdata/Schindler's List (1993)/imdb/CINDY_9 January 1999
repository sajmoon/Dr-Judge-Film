This movie was extremely touching.  The only thing I didn't like was the
sexual content--one scene.  I don't think that it was necessary to include
in the movie.  I still give it a 10.  It showed a lot of what happened in
death camps and the horror Jewish people faced that I only read about.  It
brought it all to reality.
