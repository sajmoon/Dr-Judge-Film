This is easily Spielberg's most overrated work.  But for the content of
the
film there is nothing especially noteworthy regarding it.  The acclaim it
continues to receive seems to suggest that all you have to do is make a
DECENT Holocaust movie and - suddenly - it is a GREAT film.  His work in
&quot;The Color Purple&quot; was far superior to this effort, yet it receives little
attention today.  Again, the subject matter makes all the difference.
Worth
watching, but it's greatness is pure hype.
