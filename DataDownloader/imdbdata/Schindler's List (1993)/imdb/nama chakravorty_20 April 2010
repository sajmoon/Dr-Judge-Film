Oskar Schindler is an important personality, a legend, a person who&#x27;s
efforts are pure. &#x27;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x27;, which is about this the man named
above, is one of the greatest biopics to hit Cinema, ever! A film that
becomes reality, after a while, you become Schindler, it&#x27;s a film where
you win and lose.<br /><br />I am not going to say why to have to watch &#x27;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x27;, if your
a unabashed Cinema-Fan, then watching this film is a rule. You cannot
miss this one, you just can&#x27;t. Spielberg&#x27;s execution to the subject, as
always, is awe-inspiring. There is, There Was and There Will Only Be
One Steven Spielberg, - period. Acting wise, Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley
and Ralph Fiennes pitch in Incredible Performances. They all deliver
performances that will remain until Cinema Remains! <br /><br />1,000 Thumbs Up for this Landmark! Rccmended to all!
