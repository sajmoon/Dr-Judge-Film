This movie is simply the greatest movie ever made, harrowing yet at the
same
time uplifting, do not let the fact that it is almost entirely shot in
black
and white put you off as this only adds to the movie and if it had been
shot
in colour it certainly would of taken something away from this awesome
piece
of cinema.
