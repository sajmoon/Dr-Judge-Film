Schindler&#x27;s list is the one of few flicks you would never forget.If you
see this movie then truly you will feel empty in the end.It will leave
you heavy hearted.Ready to cry &#x26; to feel the horrors Jews faced during
holocaust.Spielberg is class.He makes your emotions to linger thanks to
memorable performance by Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler.Ben
Kingsley(Itzhak Stern) deserved an Oscar for this &#x26; also Ralph
Finees(Goeth).His performance as Goeth would stand out for the most
nefarious performance you would see in a long time.Truly the
cinematography is vivid &#x26; the black-white version takes you back to the
1940&#x27;s again in the evil of holocaust.This movie can&#x27;t be
emulated.Itzhak Stern said that &#x22;Whoever saves one life saves the world
entire.&#x22;.So if you haven&#x27;t seen this yet then buy a DVD and see for
yourself,relive those moments where the true Oscar Schindler saved
many.True hats off to the real Schindler.I just want to go back in time
where Oscar would say &#x22;If I could save one more life&#x22;.True emotional
experience.
