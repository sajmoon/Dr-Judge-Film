A movie that everyone must see.<br /><br />This movie had me thinking about it for a long time after it was
finished. You can&#39;t help but feel for the Jews and the way they were
treated just makes you feel sick.<br /><br />Every actor in this movie done a great job. There is lots of violence
in this movie that shocks and sickens most and believe me they don&#39;t
hold back. This movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a German who
see&#39;s what is happening to the Jews and try&#39;s to save them. Spielberg
done a very good job. This movie is like a history lesson.<br /><br />I recommend it to every person on the planet.<br /><br />7/10
