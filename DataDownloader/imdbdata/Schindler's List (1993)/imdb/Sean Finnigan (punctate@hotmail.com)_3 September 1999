I thought I would watch the movie again before I reviewed it, which is easy
since I have it on tape. I have seen this movie a number of times and it
still impresses me. Schindler's List is Steven Spielberg's most
extraordinary movie. It's the true story of Oskar Schindler a business man
who saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. It won 7 Academy Awards
inaddition to a number of other awards including the Director's Guild. The
Cinematography for this movie was brilliantly done, it was truly haunting.
This film had some of the best performances I have seen. Ralph Fiennes did
an excellent acting job when took on the character Amon Goeth. Amon a man
who likes his Jewish maid a little too much, he seems to be quite disturbed
and also is quite brutal. Liam Neeson acting so also excellent he really
played the role. Oskar Schindler is a member of the Nazi party who is a
womanizer and a war profiteer. He character changes very much because he
knows what the Germans are trying to due the Jews. The scene where the
Germans remove the Jews from the Ghetto is disturbing and well directed. The
unearthing of the bodies scene is haunting and disturbing. The ending of
this movie brings a tear to my eye everytime. An extraordinary film with a
compelling story and stunning score. 10/10 for this masterpiece. Number 9 on
the AFI's 100 greatest movies.
