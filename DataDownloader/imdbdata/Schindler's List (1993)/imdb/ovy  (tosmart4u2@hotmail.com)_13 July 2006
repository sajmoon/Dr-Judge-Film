i have seen a lot of movies from Spielberg this one is next level , a
great great movie i am Muslim and this movie mostly is about jew&#39;s but
this movie is not bout racism its about humanity and the thing what one
guy ( Osaka) did is amazing for Jew&#39;s at the end of the movie i really
cried....got emotional .anyways guys watchout for this movie and i am
suggesting especially any jew should watch and learn wot &quot;Osaka&quot; did
for their generation. like in this movie its says &quot;you save one person
life u saves the whole generation&quot; and also this movie is about cruel
German army to jew&#39;s, but the funny thing is if Jew&#39;s watch this movie
and learn they should realize are they not doin same in gaza wot German
did to them back in history.......
