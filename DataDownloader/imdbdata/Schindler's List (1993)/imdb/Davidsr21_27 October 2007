Quite simply, I believe this is the best movie ever made, frame for
frame. Spielberg has done such an incredible directing job, and the
writing and acting are so exemplary that by the time the movie is about
one-third over you&#39;re convinced that you&#39;re watching a real-life
documentary.<br /><br />I saw Schindler&#39;s List at a wide screen theater that seats almost 1,000
viewers, and about midway through the movie I looked around. Literally
100% of the viewers were sitting there with their mouths wide open, and
that every now and then I checked for this, and it never changed.<br /><br />Despite the length of the movie, the audience remains spell-bound, and
to me this incredible production absolutely merits that. To bring this
horrific time in world history to the movie screen in such a powerful
and emotionally engaging way is just a staggering accomplishment, and
one can only hope that school systems will continue to make it
mandatory viewing for their students. <br /><br />If any movie is a &quot;CAN&#39;T MISS,&quot; this is it! <br /><br />My only question is: how can 5,741 IMDb readers POSSIBLY give this a
rating of &quot;1&quot;?
