 Schindler,s List is the only Steven Spielberg film that I've ever really
taken seriously. Tht three title roles are all played to perfection and the
black and white only adds to its documentary style.<br /><br /> It captures the horrors of the holocaust from both points of view. Using
both graphic violence and the dialogue between the Jewish victims to portray
the insanity and horror.<br /><br /> Ralph Fiennes performance has to be the best of them all because he shows
that you don't have to be a monster to do  deeds of unspeakable
evil.<br /><br /> Ahead of Goodfellas, Forrest Gump and Fargo as the finest film of this
decade.
