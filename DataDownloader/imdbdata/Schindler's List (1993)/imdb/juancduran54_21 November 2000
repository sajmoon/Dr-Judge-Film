This film is , without doubt of be wrong , the only &quot;serious&quot;
film made by Spielberg (not for people without brain).It is one of the most
human films ever made  ,it is hard like the life is (exactly the opposite of
all the other Spielberg's films),and show a great true :the mankind is bad 
by nature ....I'm sure that any other country would have done what Germans
did,why?,because every human have the evil inside him...that's the great
true about mankind...But there are good persons in all the places of the
world, persons like Oscar Schindler ,who loose all his money saving innocent
people of the worst possible die: in a extermination camp (the real name of
camps like Auchswitz or Dachau ;not &quot;concentration camps&quot;). The reason why I
enjoy so much this film ,it is because make me believe a great true: not all
the mankind is bad.
