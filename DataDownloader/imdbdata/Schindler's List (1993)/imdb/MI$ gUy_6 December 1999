I had no intention to see this movie.  From the previews I had seen, I could
tell it was a true to life movie with social significance.  However, I
thought it would probably be long, drawn out, and boring.  Boy was I
wrong.<br /><br />Luckily, it was showing on a movie channel and I sat down and watched it. 
At the very beginning I was a little confused with what was going on.  I
also didn't match up most of the character's names with their faces. 
However, this only makes me want to see it again.  This is definitely a
movie I could see over and over again.<br /><br />This movie will blow you away more than any of Spielberg's other movies
which are heavy in special effects.  This is perhaps the most realistic
movie I have ever seen.  I can't imagine a person not liking this
movie.<br /><br />This is a must see and a must own!!!
   
I give it a 10 out of 10.
