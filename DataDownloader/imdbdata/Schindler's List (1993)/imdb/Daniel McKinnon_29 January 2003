This movie was made to win Best Picture, to deny it that would be
blasphemy.
Is it my favorite movie of all time?  No it is not (only because this
isn't
the kind of film you watch every week to enjoy), but it is the greatest
piece of film-making I have ever seen.  Every human should see this film;
they should know what transpired in the Holocaust, and they should
reflect.<br /><br />A masterpiece through and through.
