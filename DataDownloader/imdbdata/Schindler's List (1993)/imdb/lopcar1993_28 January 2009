Schindler&#39;s list is perhaps the best and most heartbreaking depiction
of the Holocaust ever, It&#39;s a dark and heart breaking tale of one man&#39;s
journey to become a hero to the Jew&#39;s of today, Liam Neeson plays Oskar
Schindler a greedy factory owner who hires Jew&#39;s to minimum wage work
for him. Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as
can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and
attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish
people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi&#39;s, after that he sets
his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into
his country. Schindler&#39;s List is the proved example of human kindness
and compassion, It&#39;s a movie that will make your heart break and make
the spirit soar at his heroic feet. Schindler&#39;s List is one of the
greatest films ever made and will continue to shock and amaze people
for all time. I very highly recommend this movie!
