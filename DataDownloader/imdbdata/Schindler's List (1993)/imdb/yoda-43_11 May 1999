Schindler's List is one of the reasons I am such a huge film buff. The
film
depicts the lives of Oscar Schindler and his wife, Ishtak Stern, Amon
Goerth, and the survivors of the Holocaust. The movie, to my knowledge, is
historically accurate.
It touched me in a way that few movies have ever done. My favorite scenes
are when Olek has to hide with Danka and the other children in the toilet,
when the survivors place the rocks on Oscar's grave, and when Oscar cries
&quot;I
could've saved one more. Liam Neeson,Raiff Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley make
their best performances, and all deserved Academy Awards. Schindler's List
is a must-see for any movie fan.
