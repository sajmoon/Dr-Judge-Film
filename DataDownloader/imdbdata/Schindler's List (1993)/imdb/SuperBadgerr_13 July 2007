I saw this movie last night, I was so moved by the whole movie,
although the first hour is talking, once you see what happens to the
Jewish when they are done talking you begin to be afraid for them
yourselves.<br /><br />I think Speilburg&#39;s idea to use black and white is simply stunning as
is his idea for The Little Girl In Red and the tiny bit of yellow in
eyes, it adds so much more. The characters in this make the movie so
much more realistic (I&#39;ve heard they were in talks for Mel Gibson or
Kevin Costner to lead) every bit of acting is great even the children
that are only on screen for several seconds how they get fear in their
eyes. The end, just ends everything so nicely because how else could
you end such a tragedy?<br /><br />So My rating- 10/10 See this movie.
