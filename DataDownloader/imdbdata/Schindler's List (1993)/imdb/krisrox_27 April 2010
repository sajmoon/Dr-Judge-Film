Impressive job by Spielberg, but still a little too melodramatic for
this (European) viewer. Sweeping, understated scenes alternate with
Hollywood&#x27;s patented pulling of the heart strings, which feels wholly
unnecessary given the fact that the subject is so obviously tragic.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a must-see, if only for several key scenes
that will be stay with you forever - the haunting images of Auschwitz
and the cleaning of the ghetto had me transfixed and visualized the
plight of the Polish Jews more than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen or read
about the subject. Here, the decision to film and black &#x26; white proved
a stroke of genius.<br /><br />In the end, I found myself agreeing more with Polanski&#x27;s take on the
Holocaust (The Pianist). More economically told, more powerful.
