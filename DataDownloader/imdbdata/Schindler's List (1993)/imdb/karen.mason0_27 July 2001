Schindler's list is without a doubt fantastic to say the least. A
masterpiece. It is very much historically correct and worthy of all the
academy awards it won. I must admit though, I found this film hard and
tough
to watch. After I viewed it I had to really think about whether I liked it
or not. After the second time I viewed the film, I fell in love with the
feature.<br /><br />The story is based on Oscar Schindler's factories during the war and how a
greedy, charming and womanizing man was the unlikely Saviour of more then
a
thousand Jews.<br /><br />Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give fantastic and dramatic performances, but
the real credit here goes to Ralph Fiennes who plays the evil murderer
Amon
Goeth. His performance is fantastic and haunting. As soon as neither Liam
Neeson or Ralph Fiennes received an Oscar for their roles in the film I
went
completely against the Academy awards and didn't watch the Oscars again
until 1997 where Titanic won the Best Picture Oscar. I watched the Oscar's
again in 1998 and my jaw flew open as soon as Shakespeare in love beat
Saving Private Ryan to the Best Picture award (what a joke). I haven't
watched the Oscar's since.<br /><br />This film is my third Favourite movie and I give it 10/10. Well done
Spielberg you've amazed me again.
