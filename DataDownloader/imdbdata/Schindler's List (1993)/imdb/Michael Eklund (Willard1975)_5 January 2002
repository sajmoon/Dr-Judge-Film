I have to say this movie is one of those who have really touched me
deeply.
Imagine thousands of people being &quot;slaughtered&quot; because:<br /><br />1. Their beliefs were/are different than others.
2. They had plenty of fortune.
3. They &quot;looked&quot; different. (Did they?).<br /><br />Sounds stupid doesn't it?<br /><br />Then imagine that all of this has actually happened for real, and that the
reasons were among those that i have mentioned.<br /><br />It is a horrible movie, but yet a masterpiece that we need to see to be
reminded so that this does never happen again. I truly admire Oscar
Schindler for what he did.<br /><br />This is Spielbergs best movie ever, and he will probably never make a
better
one.
