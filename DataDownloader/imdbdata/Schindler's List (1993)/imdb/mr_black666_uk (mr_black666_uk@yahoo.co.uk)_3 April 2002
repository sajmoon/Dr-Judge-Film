Given the magnitude of the events the film portrays I think simply being a
good film is not enough.  The acting, for the main characters at least, is
good, the shooting is fine, the script isn't too sentimental or cheesy,
the
music is good and suitable, and so on...but this is not a film about two
guys who wake up not being able to remember where they parked their car,
this should be better.  Too many people praise this film simply because it
is about the holocaust, and not because they've ever sat down and thought
about it as a thing in itself (nor have they probably given any thought to
the nature of the holocaust, beyond what they 'learn' from films such as
this).  These same people, some who go as far as to call this shell of a
movie one of mans greatest accomplishments, say that children should be
made
to watch this at school to educate them.  Educate them about what? The
film
expresses nothing of worth was could not be equally well expressed in the
sentence &quot;The holocaust is bad, and Germans are/were (the distinction
isn't
really made) evil&quot;.  There's precious little real history in school these
days without this being misrepresented as it.  It explains nothing of how
it
happened, or why it happened, one day a bunch of Germans got to together
and
decided to kill some Jews.  That is fine in it's self, but prevents it
from
being a great film, or having any deeper meaning.
