I have lost my enthusiasm for any Steven Spielberg movies over the past
several years, ever since he made the switch from good entertainment to
preachy message movies showing people all angsty and heartfelt and noble,
emotions which he approaches with all the subtlety of Gallagher and his
Sledge-o-matic.  Spielberg's films are now more like the corny ramblings of
grandpa in his dotage where good people are really good and bad people are
bad and even people who are in that grey zone are given a black or white
role in the end.  It's all quite tedious to watch.<br /><br />It took me a long time to finally get through Schindler's List, as it did
Saving Private Ryan, because I was all too aware the entire time that I was
being manipulated -- what to feel and when to feel it.  Some reviewer put it
best when he likened Spielberg to the Wizard of Oz, hiding behind a curtain
and pushing buttons and pulling switches on people's emotions.  Then he is
hailed as an artist and a genius when it's all gross manipulation.<br /><br />Liam Neeson did give a good performance.  His character had more depth to
explore than Ralph Fiennes.  Excellent actor Fiennes may be, but he was
saddled with a pitifully cardboard character.  Still, I rooted for him until
the end.<br /><br />If I want to learn about the Holocaust, I'll watch a documentary and see the
facts and have genuine emotions, not be told what to feel.  Jaws, Jurassic
Park, and the Indiana Jones movies are plain fun and have the true Spielberg
touch, doing what he does best.<br /><br />3/10
