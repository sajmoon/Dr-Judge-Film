With this comment I just want to say thank you to STEVEN SPIELBERG, for
making the most important(and best) movie in film history. Keep up the good
work. We need more films of this character, films that give us a accurate
description of history, tells us what we need to know, and help prevent
things like this ever happening again. Thank you.
