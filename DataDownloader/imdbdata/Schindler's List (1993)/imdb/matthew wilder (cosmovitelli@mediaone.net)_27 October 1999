The critic Terrence Rafferty put it best: SCHINDLER'S LIST has a primal
emotional power that hasn't been felt since silent film.<br /><br />Those who prefer the post-structuralist beard-scratching of Claude
Lanzmann's unbearable SHOAH to this movie are denying the potency of great
populist art. Like Dickens and Griffith, Spielberg uses melodramatic
techniques to make ideas palpable to a mass audience. In America at least,
public perception of the Holocaust will be forever changed. You can carp
that the audience's experience is synthetic, Disneyish, but is a fictional
re-experiencing of these events worse than an abstract and remote noodling
over them? Is it worse to represent the Holocaust in fiction than to leave
it as a concept--and, as history bears out, a deniable
one?<br /><br />As a work of filmmaking, it ranks with the greatest. In LIST, Spielberg
arrives at a point--shoulder to shoulder with Scorsese
--as the most dexterous and gifted of filmmakers working today. Scene after
scene displays an offhand, unplanned-feeling mastery of the medium that
staggers the imagination in its power. The cumulative effect--as in the
best
of Spielberg's earlier work--is of a long and sustained, almost unbearable
cry of loss. Intellectuals have come to so despise Steven Spielberg, the
mogul of Century City, that they have become blind to Spielberg the
craftsman and artist. (Spielberg's smarm while receiving his first Academy
Award didn't help this perception.) SCHINDLER'S LIST is the only film I've
seen in my adult life where the screen disappeared; I was no longer aware
of
the construction of the movie and entered into it as spontaneously as a
child. Surely Spielberg will never again find material that engages him so
profoundly. But this film, far dwarfing its aspiring successor SAVING
PRIVATE RYAN, places Spielberg at the first rank of film
artists.
