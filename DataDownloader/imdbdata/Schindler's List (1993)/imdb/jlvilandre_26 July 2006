Poor Oskars&#39;s remarkable and more than brave endeavor in saving human
lives during the dark days of WW2 in Europe almost immediately takes a
back seat to the lamentations of the filmmaker in perpetuating the
plight of a certain group of people on which unspeakable atrocities
were perpetrated upon. A film that helps promote liberties taken over
the years by that certain group of people from anything to a good seat
at the Opera to unabated attempts to destroy other people&#39;s beliefs and
right to exist.<br /><br />This film is (unfortunately), not about a man&#39;s humanitarian well-meant
efforts to do what he could to help to save a group of desperate and
obviously(for most of them) doomed to their certain death, people.<br /><br />The point that came across was visually witnessing the random acts of a
certain person committing atrocities and exaggerating them to an extent
that diminished what really happened to those people. In trying to add
visual credibility via sensationalism made a mockery and a not so
subtle message that a certain group of people have rights forever to
commit atrocities to avenge what befell them over the centuries. If
there is such a thing as a hate film, well this is it, generalizing 40
million people as monsters for the actions of a handful of lunatics
sanctioned by the so-called Allies that were still full of boast and
smugness and let&#39;s face it, blindness to what was going on. In short,
the filmmaker&#39;s point was very subjective, to put it mildly.
