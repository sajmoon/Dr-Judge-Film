An incredible movie.  One thing that stands out in my mind about this
 classic film is the great characterization of all the players due to superb
 acting, directing, and scripting.  Ralph Fiennes character is especially
 vile but at the same time human.  He may be 95% evil but to not present a
 stereotypical and archetypical 100% bad character makes him infinately more
 realistic.  Filmed in black and white, this story certainly shows the
 shades of gray that is the duality of man.  This is further exemplified by
 Schindler's own declaration of being a bad person because he could have
 done more good and saved more lives.
