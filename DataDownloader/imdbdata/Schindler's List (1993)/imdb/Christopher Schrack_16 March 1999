This film is Spielberg's true masterpiece.  It depicts something that is so
hard to describe, a story so hard to tell in true honesty.  But it was.
True brutal honesty.  I can definitely see why this film won Best Picture.<br /><br />Besides the fact that this was probably the ONLY film I have seen that has
brought me close to tears, it has other characteristics that also make this
such a technical work of art.  The black &amp; white tone of the film was not
only there to make it seem like a dark and dreary film, but to make other,
more important aspects, stand out.  In one scene you see a girl running into
a building; the girl is wearing a red coat.  It stands out among all the
shades of gray to symbolize something important: the death and suffering of
the holocaust.  In another scene, dead bodies are pulled away as Oskar
Schindler (Liam Neeson) watches.  The corpses' blood is pure red, to show
the major amount and therefore pointlessness of their bloodshed.  In one of
the last scenes in the film, Jews light a bright orange flame which is
ignited on the candle.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that this is the most spectacular piece of work ever
accomplished (after all it was pretty slow and almost 3 1/2 hours long), but
it is something.  This is a film that can never, ever be forgotten.  Well
done, Spielberg.<br /><br />10 / 10 stars.
