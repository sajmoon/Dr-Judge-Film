Steven Spielberg may be the most overrated director of all time.  Jaws was a
great movie, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind was probably his best
and most ambiguous film, but even they had their flaws.  Raiders of the Lost
Ark, a film that is supposed to bring out the kid inside everybody, was, in
my opinion, a failure.  E.T.-The Extra Terrestrial was shamelessly
manipulative and, at times, downright pathetic.  Schindler's List is widely
considered to be his masterpiece and the best film of the 90's.  It is
debatable as to whether this is a truly great film or a shameless waste of
time.<br /><br />Spielberg uses many of his usual trademarks, such as a lack of character
development, using John William's score to melodramatize scenes that are
dramatic enough, and attempting to make positively ambiguous scenes overly
obvious to the viewer.  The scene with the girl in red is often acclaimed,
but if the girl hadn't been colored, we still would have noticed her, simply
because she's out of place walking past groups of Nazi's. <br /><br />Spielberg's one-dimensional Nazi's are not as terrifying as he may have
intended them to be.  Had he made them more human than one-dimensional, we
would be more horrified by their cold-blooded acts.  <br /><br />Liam Neeson plays his role well, but Spielberg's characterization of
Schindler is simply too ambiguous.  He does not attempt to explore why
Schindler suddenly saves these Jews, but many people won't notice this
anyways, which is probably what he was thinking.<br /><br />Schindler's List isn't quite what its made out to be.  It is a daring film,
and Spielberg made it to the best of his ability, but unfortunately, he
doesn't have a whole lot of ability compared to the directors he's usually
ranked with.<br /><br />
