This is a hugely powerful, emotional film which everyone must and should
see. Spielburg tackles the delicate subject matter with respect and yet
brutal honesty which leaves little to our imagination. The impact of this
film when you first see it stays with you long after it has ended. Neeson,
Fiennes and Kingsly all give career defining performances.
It's hard to imagine this film was made by the same guy who made
ET.
A masterpiece.
