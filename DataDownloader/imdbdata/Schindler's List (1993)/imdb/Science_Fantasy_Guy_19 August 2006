Oskar Schindler was not a good person in the strictest sense of the
word. A member of the Nazi Party, he drank like a fish, gambled,
conducted dealings on the black market and cheated on his wife
innumerable times. Yet he found salvation by doing something so great
even he could not comprehend its greatness: he changed himself for the
greater good, saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews employed in his
munitions factory from the hatred of the Nazi regime.<br /><br />1993 was arguably the greatest year of Steven Spielberg&#39;s life. First
he made the rip-roaring Jurassic Park, a still technologically
astounding movie that revolutionized special effects and paid for his
kids&#39; educations for the next thirty years. But later, he presented us
with Schindler&#39;s List, a film as remarkable as Schindler&#39;s achievement
that beat nearly all other &#39;90s historical dramas into submission and
finally bagged him the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for which
he had long been unfairly passed over. And if he still hadn&#39;t won it
would have probably spawned conspiracy theories.<br /><br />Spielberg has said that the filming of Schindler&#39;s List &quot;was the most
satisfying experience of my professional career,&quot; claiming it is the
best film he has ever made. Even if I do say so myself, he&#39;s absolutely
right. Working from Steven Zaillian&#39;s masterfully constructed
adaptation of Thomas Keneally&#39;s novel Schindler&#39;s Ark, he elicits an
outstanding performance from Liam Neeson as Schindler (who justifiably
lost at the Oscars to Tom Hanks in Philadelphia), and Ralph Fiennes
pulls off what is easily one of the scariest performances in cinema
history as Amon Goeth, the SS commandant and director of the
Auschwitz-Birkenau labor camp whose favourite pastime was using Jews
for target practice. <br /><br />However, this is unquestionably Spielberg&#39;s greatest directing job.
Utilizing grainy black-and-white cinematography, Spielberg cleverly
uses lots of wide panning shots and hand-held cameras to evoke just the
right amount of shock and sympathy for Holocaust victims in each scene.
Also, he seems to have realized that in order to completely nail a film
of such depth and importance as this, you shouldn&#39;t even attempt to
glamourize the Holocaust or answer the questions it has left in modern
society. All you have to do is assess what happened and get the facts
right. <br /><br />In the production notes in the Schindler&#39;s List DVD, Spielberg writes:
&quot;No one can do anything to fix the past - that&#39;s already happened. But
a picture like this can impact us, delivering a mandate about what must
never happen again.&quot; Now I know the chances of you reading this are
devastatingly low, but if you are, Mr. Spielberg, you need not worry
because as a result of this powerhouse masterpiece you have
single-handedly re-awakened awareness of the Holocaust, ensuring that
it (hopefully) will never be repeated or forgotten. You are a god among
giants, sir.
