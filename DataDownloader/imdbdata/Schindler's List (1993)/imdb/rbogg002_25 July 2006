The haunting complexity of this evident masterpiece can only have been
so brilliantly delivered by a true master of cinema. Spielberg hurls
the audience to a time of horror throughout the world, but who is
terrorized to the highest degree is Jewish population of Germany.
Fiennes&#39; performance was nothing short of genius and was more than
qualified for an Oscar. Through this work of cinematic art I have seen
what I believe is the motion picture masterpiece not only of the 1990&#39;s
but of the late 20th century. I still to this day continued my conquest
to discover a man more devoted to ideal so powerful and so monumental
as Spielberg.
