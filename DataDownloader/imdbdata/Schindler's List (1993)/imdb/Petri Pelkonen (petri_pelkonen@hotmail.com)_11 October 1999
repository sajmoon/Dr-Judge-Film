Schindler&#39;s List is a masterpiece.In this movie there is the 2nd world
war and the Nazies are treating the Jews very badly.There is one guy
who can&#39;t just watch all these people being transported to
concentration camp, getting killed in the gas chambers,so he decides to
do something.He wants to save as many of them as he can.That man is
Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson.Other actors include Ben
Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. Schindler&#39;s List is a winner of 7
Oscars.Steven Spielberg is a great<br /><br />film maker.This movie really makes you think how rotten man can
be.Luckily that&#39;s not true with every man.
