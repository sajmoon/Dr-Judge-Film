I am a history major specializing in World War II history; particularly
the
Holocaust.  I have never been more moved by a movie before.  The events
that
occur throughout the movie is very authentic and I'm going to give
Spielberg
another nod for making such a masterpiece.  I am absolutely elated that it
is now out on DVD.  I am quite positive that I will someday use this movie
to supplement teaching my own classes someday.  Oskar Schindler was an
amazing man, and I feel that Spielberg chose the right man in Liam Neeson
to
play the part.  Liam Neeson delivers a crucial intensity to the role, and
draws the viewer into his world.  I would highly recommend this movie to
anyone regardless of how depressing the subject matter is.  It is a
must-see, so go out and watch it!
