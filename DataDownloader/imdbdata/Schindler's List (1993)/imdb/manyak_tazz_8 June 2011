This is not a happy movie, or a feel good hit. It is a moving story of
one light in the darkness of Germany. It shows the depths to which
humanity can sink without God. I recommend this movie, but with
warnings. It contains penury; shows violence of nature; and the subject
matter is about one of the most hideous times in recent history.
However, it is all in the telling of this true story; a story that
should be told. Exactly, not a film for children.<br /><br />This an elegant film and an accurate description of the Holocaust. You
cannot change the Holocaust around to make it a happy. The Holocaust
was a sad, dark event. The scenes of violence and nudity were relevant
to this film. The brilliant director, Steven Spielberg, chose to show
mild scenes from the Holocaust. I have seen a lot worse things. And the
reason the film didn&#x27;t show any of the other groups tortured was
because Oskar Schindler saved Jews, so it was probably unnecessary to
show or mention the other groups. And also because the fact that Jews
were the main group targeted. The penury was important, too. In the
scene of the selection in the concentration camp, the penury was
necessary to make an accurate definition and the sexual scenes were
there to show that Schindler was a womanizer. This film is one of the
greatest motion pictures ever made and everyone should watch it.<br /><br />While it&#x27;s a movie for mature audiences, the viewer shouldn&#x27;t fast
forward through any scene. They&#x27;ll miss something if they do.
Spielberg&#x27;s best movie and one of the best films ever made. To many
Holocaust films shy from the truth. That is sad, because it is one of
the most important events in the 20th century. Watch this movie, watch
it carefully, and see what you learn from it&#x97;the nudity has a part in
this film.
