i would like to make a comment on the last review. it's true that this
movie has some kind of fiction. every movie has more or less fiction in
it. but the SS definitely did the terrible things as shown in this
movie. besides that i think it's a bit of no respect to the survivors
of the holocaust and the camps to say that the movie is a comedy. i
don't know if you've ever been to europe and visited one of those camps
but it takes you're breath away. it's awful. My review on this movie is
that it shows the holocaust in a way that everybody who sees it feels
like being in one of those camps. i really think this movie is on of
the greatest of all time, not the best but it shows to broad public the
horror of World War 2.
