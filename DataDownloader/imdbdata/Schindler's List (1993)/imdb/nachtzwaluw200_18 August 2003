This movie is definitely my favorite one.<br /><br />The movie<br /><br />It is shot in a very realistic setting and makes the viewer believe that
he/she is really co-existing in the movie. I am glad that it is shot in
black/white instead of color. This adds a more dark and pessimistic tone,
like it was in those days. However, there is one color added in the
ghetto
liquidation scene. The red coat of the little girl. This color adds to
the
sad situation the girl is in.<br /><br />The story<br /><br />The story is very unique and original: A German businessman is saving the
lives of Jews. It is maybe not like it really happened. But without that
background info the viewer still gets a realistic view of that period of
time. The end of the movie is very sad when Schindler has to leave the
Jews.<br /><br />The music<br /><br />John Williams made a fantastic soundtrack for this movie. I bought the
soundtrack of course and enjoy listening to it. My favorite is the piano
reprise.<br /><br />I certainly recommend this movie to anyone who still hasn't seen it.<br /><br />
