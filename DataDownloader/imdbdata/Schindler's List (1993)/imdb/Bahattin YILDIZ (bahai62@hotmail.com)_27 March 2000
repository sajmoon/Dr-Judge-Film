  Mr. Spielberg is just a prodigy of the &quot;cinema&quot;. I can't remember a second
movie which has impressed me more than this. I can tell you that at the
night I watched this movie I dreamt of the movie till the
morning.
  It was such a fascinating, such a touching movie that at some instants I
couldn't keep my tears....
  I wish such movies would appear more frequently. It shows the magic of the
&quot;cinema&quot; to the utmost extent.
