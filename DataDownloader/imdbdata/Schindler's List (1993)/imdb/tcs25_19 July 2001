This is a great film and tells a wonderful heart wrenching story, but to
watch a movie, this long, in black &amp; white is almost unbearable.  Someone
should inform Spielberg that black and white films went out with the
Western
films.  Sure the black and white filming was to set a mood but was the mood
to be irritation, because that's what it was, irritating.  Overall it's a
good movie and I would recommend this film, but maybe Ted Turner will put
into color for us.
