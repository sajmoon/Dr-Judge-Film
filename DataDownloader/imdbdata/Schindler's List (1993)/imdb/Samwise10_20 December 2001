This movie really made you feel for the people who were involved in this
terrible ordeal.  I wouldn't consider it to be one of favorite movies of
all
time, but mainly this is because it isn't my favorite type of movie.  As a
documentary I think it is superb and I highly recommend that others see it
so that they too can see some of the atrocities that this world has seen
and
so we can make sure that this never happens again.
