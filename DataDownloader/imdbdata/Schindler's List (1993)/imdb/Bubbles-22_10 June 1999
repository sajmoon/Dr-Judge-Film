This has GOT to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I was so
deeply moved when I first saw it that I could hardly watch it. I cried for
nearly all three hours of the movie. Liam Neeson, as usual, did a superb
job
in acting his part. He was a charming lady's-man, and you couldn't help
but
like him, even in the beginning. This is a movie about the Holocaust that
people should not miss. A definite classic
