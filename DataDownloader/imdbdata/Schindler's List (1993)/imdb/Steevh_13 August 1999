I'm going to have to agree with a previous comment that 'people only liked
this because it was seen as unwise' to objectively comment. This was a
'cause movie'- and as such is no better, or no worse, than the others.
Like
'Amistad' that followed it, it's plodding, pretentious and badly shot. The
black and white cinematography lends nothing to it except the illusion of
reality; which it isn't: it's a film. It's a story. Not a documentary.
It's
a constructed series of events, with 'characters' and a 'narrative' and a
'script'. The fact that the holocaust-survivors laud it as 'how it was' is
the ultimate expression of its failure. The novel left you thankful that
you
weren't there, but never once made you feel like you were. Spielberg's
film
tricks you into imagining that it shows how terrible the holocaust was- it
doesn't. And can't.<br /><br />Many have stated that they 'understand' the events of Hitler's Germany
through the movie. By giving them this false 'understanding'; Spielberg
has
cheapened it, and made it more comfortable than it should be.
Subjectively,
for many, this grants them leave to display false, *constructed*, grief
for
something that no amount of 'grieving' can in any way come to terms with.<br /><br />As a film; a piece of fictionalised narrative, it suffers from hammy
performances... most obviously the ridiculous Ralph Fiennes with his
sitcom
nazi- a safe, comfortable idea; neatly slotting him into the 'bad guys'
package that drama utilises, but 'real life' finds no easy place for.<br /><br />A film shot in black and white that regrettably uses these absolutes in
its
storytelling. An effective parable? Perhaps. But a worrying
one.<br /><br />Steev
