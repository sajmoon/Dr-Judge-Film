To sum up Spielberg's masterwork in one word is a nearly impossible task,
but I have come to the conclusion that Schindler's List is perfect. Liam
Neeson as Oskar Schindler is truly great in recreating the role of a
modern
day Moses. Making this film all the more compelling is John Williams'
perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the
awards
bestowed upon it, especially best picture by the National Board of Review
and the Academy and the Academy Award for best director Steven Spielberg.
It
deserves all these awards and more. Schindler's List is a film that
everyone
should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain an
immortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film.
