From the mind behind Jaws, E.T., Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones ...the
director who highly entertained the world with his quality adventure
films, it&#x27;s heartwarming to see a movie being made this good about the
darkest period of last century. Crafted with immense care &#x26; dedication,
Schindler&#x27;s List is Steven Spielberg&#x27;s most personal, most matured
effort &#x26; his best film so far. Perfect in every department, this
masterpiece cements Spielberg&#x27;s name on the list of the greatest
directors in cinema history.<br /><br />Schindler&#x27;s List is by far one of the most shocking, haunting,
artistic, influential and powerfully moving films I&#x27;ve ever seen and
certainly is one of the greatest films ever made. No doubt, it is one
of the most honored films of all time today &#x26; deservingly so. The
emotional impact this film has on its viewers is huge &#x26; hard to forget.<br /><br />Schindler&#x27;s List presents the indelible true story of the enigmatic
Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party, womanizer n war profiteer
who saved the lives of more than 1100 Jews during the Holocaust. It is
the triumph of one man who made a difference, and the drama of those
who survived one of the darkest chapters in human history because of
what he did.<br /><br />Featuring an ensemble cast of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley &#x26; Ralph
Fiennes.. the performances are powerful. Liam Neeson is very much
believable as Oskar Schindler &#x26; gives a really matured performance &#x26; so
does Ben Kingsley in his supporting role as Itzhak Stern. But the real
highlight was the role of Ralph Fiennes &#x26; he simply nailed his
character of Amon G&#xF6;th, looking pure evil &#x26; menacing &#x26; very much real.
The rest of the cast too did their job pretty well in keeping the film
as realistic as possible, giving it a documentary feel with their
genuine emotions.<br /><br />Spielberg&#x27;s direction deserves a bow here. It&#x27;s completely different
from his previous works. The subject being too sensitive to him, it
indeed brought the best out of him. The Cinematography is classic,
whole film is set in black n white to give a timeless sense to the film
&#x26; also makes it more bleak &#x26; emotional. Red color is used to
distinguish a girl in red coat which has a brilliant symbolic meaning
later in the film. Its brutal, its dark, its violent but... IT REALLY
HAPPENED.<br /><br />The Oscar winning score is composed by the great John Williams who,
this time again, provided complete depth n emotions to the scenes with
his brilliant choice of right music. The score is simply beautiful yet
painful, meaningful yet haunting. On the whole, Schindler&#x27;s List is a
very important film, it shows that Nothing is more valuable than Human
Life n No human life can be replaced by another one. None shall give it
a miss.<br /><br />Strongly Recommended.
