Some people think that it is a good movie, some think that it is bad. It is
a great achievement after all, cause it made me think of all the horror that
had happened, again. No movie, no book, not even talking to a person who was
in a concentration camp can bring you the horror in its full scope.
Schindler's List is just a little part of the history of cruelty in World
War 2, and Saving Private Ryan just another. Both Films had a deep impact
here in Germany. Good or bad, it is good that so many young people find
their interest in the darkest chapter of a civilized world.
