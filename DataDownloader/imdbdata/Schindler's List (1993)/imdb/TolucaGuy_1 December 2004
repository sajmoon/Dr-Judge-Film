It's been asked, how could anyone not make a deeply moving movie about
this subject? There may be a basis for that question, but what
Spielberg did was also make a piece of amazing piece of film-making.
Despite his phenomnal successes, it seems as if he was hiding his hand
at what depths he could demonstrate. After years of awing and amazing
us, he now had the skills and power to deliver a most potent work.<br /><br />To be honest, I haven't seen it since it's initial release. Yet, what I
do remember is that Spielberg was able to make a three hour film on the
Shoah and make it move a brisk pace without letting up on its impact.
That's why it is brilliant.
