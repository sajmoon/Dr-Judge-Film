Hi i want to say that I have heard some people say that they heard Spielburg
is boring or untrue, and i can only say HAVE YOU SEEN this movie? Since it
is about the wonderful Jewish people, who are the natives of that parts of
Germany and were turned into soap bars as is my understanding, just
dreadful. i sware if you see this movie you to will love the little Jewish
people, i sware they look just like Hobbots from the Lord of the Rings, they
are the heroes, and all i can say is a hope i never meet a German, since
they are all so big and horrible. I believe they used to shoot people even
if the people had there hands in the air to surrendur, as is my
understanding. Anyway thank you for reading and keep truckin! Ten out of
Ten.
