This film was given many awards just for showing the truth about the Jews
and Nazis and sometimes we really need the truth to see what was going on at
times we only read about. The name Schindler was very known then and also
today is he remembered. The movie was made with care and just to tell us the
importance of seeing the Jewish side and what they had to go through in the
Holocaust.<br /><br />The movie is in black and white but some color was put in because those
pictures or situations should be noticed and it comes back throughout the
movie.<br /><br />The whole structure of the movie was really good because after viewing the
movie we get a clear picture of what was going on in the World War II. By
being inspired by a true story makes it more believable and we can
appreciate it more.
