Schindler&acute;s List is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It shows in a
true and uncensored way how the nazist abused the jews. What Oskar
Schindler
did is something noone who's seen the movie will forget.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is great in this movie, he really made us see how he turned
from
being a nazi to become its enemy.<br /><br />Schindler&acute;s List is one of the most important movies ever
made...
