Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of
the greatest films ever made in the world.<br /><br />The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited
off of slave labor.  The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler.
Oskar is just like most men.  He has a love for good wine, beautiful
women,
and pursues happiness through the success of his business.  But on his
journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed
during
a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history.
As
Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered.  That's when the
self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of
having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000
Jews.<br /><br />This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black
and
white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer).  At the helm is no one other
than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and
brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't.
This film is a must see by me.  I give the film an &quot;A+&quot; (wishing I could
give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10...
