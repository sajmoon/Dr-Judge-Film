This film is very empty, for not only does it portray the Germans as &quot;evil,
lop-sided, devil worshippers&quot; but it shows the Jews as being &quot;promising,
alluring, good guys&quot;.  If one is to question morality, then do so, but do
not give us the black vs white issue found in this film.  Speilberg,
immature since day one as director, tells us what to think, he strips away
our humanity by overdosing us on excessive amounts of guilt and
sentimentality.  In effect, the film lacks any moral basis except to
denounce all evil men and with that, we learn absolutely
nothing.....
