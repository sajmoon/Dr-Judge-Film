This film just speaks of one thing importance ,the importance of
remembering what happened and the importance of realizing that there is
evil that we as ordinary people cannot really comprehend . Not only is
this film done stylishly but it is made in such a way that you are
captivated by everything that happens there are powerful performance
all round from Liam Neesons portrayal of a warm ,charismatic and
gregariuos human being to the other side of the mirror Ralph Fiennes
Amon Goeth who is bereft of a soul a brilliant portrayal of a man who
is cold and is not a human being and does not have any real
identifiable human charteristics apart from evil and that is what I
think the movie is about not only the terror and horror of a human
tragedy and disaster but showing how people can be and the two sides of
human nature<br /><br />A terrific movie
