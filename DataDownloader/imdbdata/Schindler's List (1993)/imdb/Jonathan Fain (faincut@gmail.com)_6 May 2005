Steven Spielberg made a lot of money out of his successful film, and
yes, he also finally received an Oscar (Although I think some of his
earlier work should receive one too). There are many interesting
stories about the holocaust and WWII, and I wonder what attracted
Spielberg to Schindler's story so much. Well, if you saw the film you
can see that what Spielberg and Schindler have in common is money and
ambition. Spielberg in my point of view is a great producer/business
man. He knows how to make money (even for the Holocaust). I believe
that is why Spielberg's so attracted to Schindler's character. Don't
get me wrong, Spielberg has also values as well, and it is said that
most of what the film has earned Spielberg donated to the Holocaust
foundation. Spielberg is a franchise but I get the feeling that he
cares. So in parallel to Schindler's character that evolves through the
film, Spielberg uses the money he earns to make some good.<br /><br />Schindler is presented as a business man, who is interested in making
money - actually a war profiteer. But something changes in his plan,
Schindler learns slowly that the Nazi ideology is stupid and evil, and
he goes on a process through the film of purging himself out of this
ideology. He starts to care for &quot;his Jewish workers&quot;, and by the end of
the film he even cries, not for the loss of money, but for the life he
could have saved.<br /><br />There are many scenes in this film, created in detail, through the help
of survivor's testimonies. Some of them are extremely violent or
contain nudity. Those scenes, which are shot brilliantly, are required
for realism and I really like them, as I believe that such appalling
violence is reserved only in film and not in our life.<br /><br />I find Schindler's List as a visual experience one should not miss, as
it helps you grasp the horror and violence of the Nazis. Since
Hollywood controls the world market of cinema, this movie is a
breakthrough, bringing the story of the holocaust to the whole world.
