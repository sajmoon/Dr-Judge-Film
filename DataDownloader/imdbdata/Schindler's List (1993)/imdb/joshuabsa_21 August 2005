Schindlers List is the inspiring and disturbing story of a German who
in the pretense of manufacturing weapon shells saved the life's of over
a thousand Jew's, with much risk to himself. The performances are some
of the best I have ever seen, with Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben
Kingsley are all Oscar worthy, The direction is phenomenal, Spielbergs
shots are set up in a almost documentary way bringing the horror close
up. The film is about three and a half long, but it doesn't get boring
once, which is something very few films have done, even The Godfather
had a moment or two. The story is convincing, and wonderful, as well as
very historically accurate. If you are interested in the holocaust, are
studying it, or are over the age of about sixteen there are two movies
you must see, The Pianist, and Schindlers List. Both are disturbing,
and wonderful looks on the holocaust. They are also different, The
Pianist is more by the view of the Jew's, and Schindlers List more by
the view of a German who saves them. Schindlers List is my favorite of
the two.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Schindlers List you might also like, The Pianist, and
Saving Private Ryan.
