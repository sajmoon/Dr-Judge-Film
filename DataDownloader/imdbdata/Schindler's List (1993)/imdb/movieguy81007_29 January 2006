Schindler's List is a great film.Even though it is a graphic telling of
the Holocaust. I think Liam Neeson should have won for Best Actor.I
still think Tommy Lee Jones deserves his Oscar for The Fugitive. Don't
get me wrong I still think Ralph Fiennes did a great performance. I
think this is Steven Spielberg's best work. I think the Cinematography
is great. This movie was filmed in Poland. I'm glad Steven Spielberg
shot this movie in Black &amp; White. Schindler's List is better than
Saving Private Ryan. I am so glad Steven Spielberg won Best Director
for this movie. People who hate this movie do not know what a good
movie is.
