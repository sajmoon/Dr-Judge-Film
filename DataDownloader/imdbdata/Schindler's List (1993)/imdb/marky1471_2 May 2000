CAREFUL- COMMENTS ON THE PLOT!!!<br /><br />I don't much like to go &quot;high brow&quot;, as it were, but this was recommended
to
me by my mum and after watching it my breath was taken away. I haven't felt
this way since another Steven Spielberg film, &quot;Hook&quot; in 1991.<br /><br />All the actors were really good- Liam Neeson (Star Wars) and his hidden
attraction for his secretary, Ben Kingsley (Ghandi), Ralph Fiennes
(Lawnmower man) sarcastically killing jews in his camp. And all with a
cliffhanger ending- will they make it to the end of the war? As a final
point, the soundtrack, by John Williams (ET) really left a lump in my
throat.<br /><br />Go and see this film- it'll make you think differently about war and human
nature.
