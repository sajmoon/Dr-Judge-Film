Schindler's List is as incredible a film as we are likely to come upon in
American cinema. The story of the opportunistic Oskar Schindler's
metamorphosis from greed to generosity is truly as powerful as it gets.
Taking Polish Jews into his metal working factory as cheap labor, he
initialy takes advantage of the people. The opening of the film is laced
with wit and Schindler's magnetism. In a crucial turning point, he witnesses
the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto and the movement of the people to a
forced labor camp run by the vicious and puzzling German commandant Amon
Goeth. From this point on, Schindler is forever changed and does whatever he
can to help the Jews.<br /><br />Schindler's List has an incredible script, full of wit and humor at certain
points, then sadness and humanity at the next. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes
are exceptional in their roles as Schindler and Goeth respectivly, but the
standout is Ben Kingsley as Schindler's quiet Jewish accountant Izshak
Stern. His growing subtle passion and strength make the last scene with him
simply beautiful. John Williams, better known for his booming musical
companions to Spielberg adventures, delivers a score of beauty equal to the
film. The cinematography is brilliant beyond description, it must be seen to
be believed. Steven Spielberg should have won two Best Director awards for
this film.<br /><br />The movie urges the audience to never forget the horrors of the Holocaust
and the reality of its destruction. Despite the tragic situation of the Jews
and Schindler, the film is also uplifiting. Schindler's achievement
outweighs the merciless killings by Goeth despite the lopsided statistics.
Somewhere around 1400 Jews escaped death thanks to Schindler, and the lives
he saved will always triumph over the Nazis. As Stern proclaims in the
heartwrenching finale, whoever saves one man, saves the world entire.
