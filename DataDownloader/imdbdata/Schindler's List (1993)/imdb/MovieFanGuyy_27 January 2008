Schindler&#39;s List, the Oscar winner for Best Picture of 1993 is
definitely one of the great films ever made, it cemented Steven
Spielberg&#39;s status as the greatest filmmaker of our generation, and it
cemented the evil legacy that is the holocaust.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler, played masterfully by Liam Neeson is the center point
of this masterpiece, all surrounded by some of the best professionals
in the business, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, etc.<br /><br />For years, I avoided writing a review to this film, because it is too
painful and too powerful to write something about a film that has
haunts you for many years.<br /><br />The holocaust was one of the most evil experiences in human history.
For a director like Steven Spielberg to take such a horrible human
tragedy and to make something poignant about it, demonstrates his
abilities as the greatest director of our time.<br /><br />Spielberg takes the story of a greedy, selfish German businessman, and
uses it as a force to demonstrate that human tragedy can turn anyone
into a force for good, no matter what the consequences.<br /><br />Nominated for 12 Academy Awards, and winner of 7 including Best
Picture, and Spielberg&#39;s first Best Director Oscar, Schinder&#39;s List can
take it&#39;s place aside some of the greatest film achievements of all
time.
