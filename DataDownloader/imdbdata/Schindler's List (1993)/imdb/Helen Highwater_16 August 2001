I don't see why people have to trash this movie. It's been called
everything
from &quot;boring&quot; (!) to &quot;ham-fisted and manipulative&quot;. To be honest, I was too
immersed in the story and the drama to care about Spielberg's techniques.
The black and white didn't detract at all from the movie. In fact, many
modern photographers choose to use black and white film because it brings
out form, light and shadow. The red coat helped me recognize the little
girl
who otherwise would've been lost among all the other grey corpses.
Schindler's List was no more manipulative than most other movies, certainly
not for the &quot;loaded&quot; subject matter it was dealing with. The scene at the
end with the survivors laying pebbles on the grave *was* unnecessary, but
that's a pretty small fault for a three-hour-long movie.<br /><br />To RipePeach: You said that Spielberg characterized Germans as just a bunch
of self-interested, evil murderers. Since when was it required that all
movies that deal with specific ethnic groups include a token &quot;good
ambassador&quot;? Would you rather have Speilberg bring the movie to a grinding
halt in order to introduce a nice, pro-Semitic German character that had
nothing to do with the story of Oskar Schindler? Read &quot;Hitler's Willing
Executioners&quot; and face the facts. Most Germans during the Holocaust were
anti-Semitic. While there was significant public outcry over the
mistreatment and slaughter of Slavs and the retarded (I think the Nazis
stopped the T-4 project as a result), very few people opposed the
extermination of the Jews. They were hated almost universally. This isn't
to
single out Germans as uniquely vicious people, or to insult present-day
Germans. Granted, had the long-standing social conditions been in place,
the
Holocaust could've happened anywhere, including my home country. But it
happened in Germany in the 1940's, so deal with it. In short, Spielberg
wasn't being prejudiced- he was just being honest.<br /><br />To Edvard Nicholas: You didn't like the happy ending? This isn't fiction.
Oskar Schindler was real and he saved the lives of more than a thousand
Jews. Therefore, the happy ending was necessary. Why lie about the fate of
the Schindler Jews and make the movie even more depressing?
