When I saw Schindler's List for the first time, it was such a shock to me.
Of course I've read about the holocaust and I saw WW 2 movies about it,
but
nothing could prepare me for this masterpiece. It's so gripping and
emotional.<br /><br />All the actors are at their best. They do not act, they are the
characters.
Ralph Fiennes is most terrifying as Amon Goeth.<br /><br />The photography is as beatiful as documentary- like. After three hours,
when
the end credits start to roll, I realized I was watching a movie and not a
documentary. And of course, Spielbergs direction makes it all just a
perfect
history lesson.<br /><br />It's a must see for everybody!
