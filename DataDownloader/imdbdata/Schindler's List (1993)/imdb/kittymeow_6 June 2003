I loved this film! It is a very thought-provoking film. It has made me
cry
the first time I have watched and every time there after. It has shown us
what genocide is really like and how stupid it would be to re-create
history
in a bad manner. I believe a lot can be taught through this film. The
metaphors and realism in this film has made me reflect upon the moments
in
history, violence is never the answer!
