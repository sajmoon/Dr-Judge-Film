The story of Oskar Schindler, adapted from Thomas Keneallay's book
'Schindler's Ark', was brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Liam
Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role,
bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his
list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.<br /><br />The film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of
a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at
the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him.
Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and
greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other
characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by
Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes.<br /><br />It doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly
so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the
list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of
anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is
Spielberg's strongest work.
