There is a reason Steven Spielberg is a household name. He is, quite simply,
the greatest director in the history of the medium. He understands film and
how it works, but more importantly than that, he understands his audience.
he understands how he can best communicate the story he wants to tell to the
masses, without sacrificing truth and his own identity. Schindler's List is
a glowing testament to that fact and it is Spielberg's finest work to date.
Do I ever think he'll surpass Schindler's List? It's possible I suppose, but
I think the story was so personal, that he won't really want to. This is
Steven Spielberg's Magnum Opus.<br /><br />There are conflicting truths about Oskar Schindler and what type of person
he was. When you compare the movie to what his family say about him, there
are small inconsistencies. Before I had seen the film I had heard both sides
of the argument and felt fairly safe in feeling that both sides of that man
were represented on screen. The business man, and the savior. I think the
film portrays him as a business man who doesn't really understand the good
he's doing until it's almost done. I like that. That's truth. That's human.
That's who I'd bet Oskar Schindler was.<br /><br />Looking back on the film, I'd say it's one of the best looking films I've
ever seen. That's not to say it's pretty. It's high contrast Black and White
was an inspired choice. I'm partial to Black and White anyway. There's
something mysterious and nostalgic about it. But the lighting and
cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (his first collaboration with Spielberg)
are a glory to watch.<br /><br />I particularly liked Liam Neeson's performance as Oskar Schindler. It was
quiet and reserved until it needed to be loud and booming. I liked how he
was able to shift character to blend with the Nazis then right back to
dealing with his workers. It was a very nuanced performance. One of his
best.<br /><br />All in all Schindler's List is a powerful film about saving lives. One man
spends all his life making a fortune, then spends every cent of it to bring
safety to 1,100 Jews. That is beauty. Within Schindler's List there is a
small bit of dialog about what power actually is. Honestly the answer
doesn't come until the end of the film.<br /><br />Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.
