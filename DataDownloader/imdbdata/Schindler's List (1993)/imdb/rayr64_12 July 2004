I don't know how I waited eleven years to see this film. This was one
of the most amazing works of art I have ever seen. The cinematography,
the music, the acting are monumental. I can't remember the last time I
have felt so touched by a movie. The scene in which Schindler is
leaving the camp to flee the allies is emotionally gut wrenching. He is
truly a man transformed. The plight of the children in the camps as
depicted in the film is particularly awe inspiring. To see them
separated from their mothers and while others hid in the toilets was
almost too much too bear watching. This movie should be watched by
everyone for generations as a reminder of the evil that man can
perpetrate on man but that one person can make a difference if they are
willing to be ruled by love.
