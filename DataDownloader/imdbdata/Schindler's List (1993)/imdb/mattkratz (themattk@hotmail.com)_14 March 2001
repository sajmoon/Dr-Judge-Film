This is truly a remarkable film, definitely deserving of the best picture
Oscar it received.<br /><br />Films based on historical fact can work if they totally absorb the audience,
and this one does. The power of the movie, Mr. Schindler's full 180 from
Nazi to helping the prisoners, and some of the images (such as the little
girl wearing a pink coat in an otherwise black-and-white setting)
contribute.<br /><br />Being Jewish myself, I was especially impressed and moved. This movie is not
to be missed. I think it will become a classic and be mentioned in the same
breath as such movies as Casablanca and Gone With the Wind. It is that
good.<br /><br />**** out of ****
