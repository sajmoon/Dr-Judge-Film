A very difficult film. Any definition is venturesome, any praise is
strange or shallow. At final, it is not a movie or adaptation of an
existence but a subtle form of catharsis. This movie is source of a
special experience. And the causes are numerous:<br /><br />1) It is an artistic masterpiece. Light, images, acting, script and
silence, nuances of tragedy and delicate suggestions are pieces of a
fascinating approach. So, it is result of a deep and powerful sentiment
and Spielberg is the gorgeous sculptor of its.<br /><br />2} The story is old and aching. The Shoah is not a Jewish or German
problem or result of propaganda. The good and the evil are elements, in
that crime, not of ethics or faith, education or fear, mercy or public
image but seal of atrocious ambiguity. And this vagueness is
fundamental part of our world. In fact,it is essence of its conscience.
So, the irrational brutality of Goeth is only clich&eacute;. The bad Nazi,
cruel, sarcastic and bizarre is rotten puppet of a death period. After
&quot;The Night of the Generals&quot; this character type is absurd.<br /><br />3} Fundamental value of film is the subtle art of suggest a reality out
of any description&#39;s form. Images are poor shadow of a crime without
limit or reason. And this suggestion is represented by Neeson&#39;s acting;
the metamorphose of an ordinary business man in a hero part of his
mission.<br /><br />4} The interpretation of Sir Ben Kingsley is touching. His character is
heard of a miracle and the tension, fear, expectation and force of
gestures, the short words and the look transforms Itzhak Stern in
conscience of fight for some people for who to survive is fragile
dream.<br /><br />5} The option for monochrome image is essence of its perfect beauty.
The mixture between ashes and human ash, between lead, tension and free
cruelty of irrational monstrosity , plans of escape and lies gives form
of a wold&#39;s fragile definition .<br /><br />6} It is a great masterpiece for the sensitivity of looking. The film
is a remember and a decent homage for a special hero and for his
strange war. But not story is important. The only virtue, the real
virtue is the image of story teller&#39;s spirit reflected in each syllable
of tale.
