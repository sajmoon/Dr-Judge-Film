Any filmmaker who chooses to deal with the Holocaust faces several
serious problems. The first is deciding which story to tell.
Conventional heroics are impossible;a realistic look at the horror is
too appalling. In Thomas Keneally&#x27;s fact-based novel,Steven Spielburg
found the right balance of redemption and sorrow. <br /><br />Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) is an ambitious businessman who realizes
that there is money to be made in war. In a masterful opening
montage,Spielburg mixed the forced transfer of Polish Jews to cities
after the Nazi occupation with Schindler making his own moves. As
families register with bureaucrats who sit at folding tables and make
their tidy lists,Schindler matches suits and ties,selects the right
cufflinks,and pockets a hefty bankroll. The Jews are forced into their
ghetto;Schindler goes to a nightclub where he wines and dines
high-ranked Nazis. The two worlds come together when Schindler meets
Itzhak Stern(Ben Kingsley)and offers him a deal. Since Jews cannot own
businesses,they should work together. Stern&#x27;s contacts can provide
financial banking. Stern himself can provide the expertise to run a
business. Schindler will bring &#x22;panache.&#x22; &#x22;That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m good at,&#x22; he
says. &#x22;Not to work...the presentation.&#x22;<br /><br />It may not be a fair deal,but once Schindler signs contracts to provide
the Wehrnmacht with cooking utensils,he is able to open an enamelware
factory that provides several hundred Jews with jobs. Those jobs,the
documentation that goes with them,give the men and women a measure of
safety as the Nazis&#x27; plans for the &#x22;final solution&#x22; grind inexorably
forward to the March 13,1943 liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. That is
one of the most harrowing series of scenes ever put on film,and it is
matched by the concentration camp sequences that follow. In those
scenes of mass chaos and slaughter,Spielburg uses a single spot of
color to highlight one little girl. In the black-and-white world,her
coat is red. It&#x27;s almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young
protagonist of Spielburg&#x27;s Empire of the Sun(1987),in a similar
situation when he&#x27;s alone in a mob and trying to find his way home.<br /><br />In those same scenes,Amon Goeth(Ralph Finnes)is introduced. Goeth is a
flabby sociopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism. He is in
charge of the camp where the workers are housed and so must be brided
and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business. Goeth&#x27;s excessive
cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from
war profiteer to crusader. The exact moment of that change is not
shown,and it should not be shown. Though popular films are built around
such epiphanies,that scene would be out of place in this careful film.
Instead,its an accretion of layered awareness that makes Schindler what
he becomes. Though Goeth is a selfish,undisciplined man who drinks too
much and sleeps with too many women,he is moved by the mounting
barbarism,cruelty,and savagery that surrounds him. Neeson&#x27;s performance
is built on a combination of self-confidence,indecision,and doubt. <br /><br />Though some have criticize Steven Zaillian&#x27;s script on the grounds that
it makes Schindler more altruistic than he really was,it does stick
closely to historical fact in the numbers of people that Schindler
saved from the Holocaust. In the same way,the real Goeth was even more
monstrous than he is in the film. But the full scope of his atrocities
had been shown,the film would have been unbalanced. As it is,Spielburg
pushes the limit,showing as much of the horror as the screen will bear.
That horror is alleviated,slightly by Janusz Kaminski&#x27;s stunning
black-and-white cinematography. It gives the violence an
abstract,dreamlike quality that no form of color could have matched. He
won an Academy Award for his work,and the American Society of
Cinematopgraphers placed the film at number five on its
best-shot(1950-1997)list. John Williams&#x27;s somber,almost unoticed score
adds the melancholy tone. &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;,also was the overall
winner at the Academy Awards. Winning seven Oscars including Best
Picture of 1993,as well as Best Director and for Steven Spielburg.<br /><br />Any viewer might be able to find shortcomings somewhere in the
collaborative effort,but to what point? Schindler&#x27;s List demonstrates
the potential of Hollywood film-making that is so rarely achieved. When
the full financial resources of the industry and best creative people
are put in service of an important story,the results can be staggering.
