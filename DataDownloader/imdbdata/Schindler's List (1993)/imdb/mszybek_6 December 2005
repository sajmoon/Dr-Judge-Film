This is without any question one of the the most horrific, but in the
same time perfect and wonderful films I&#39;ve ever seen!<br /><br />Liam Neeson is outstanding with unforgettable acting in his role as
Oscar Schindler who becomes human through the story. Ralph Fiennes
gives Neeson spectacular support as the psychopathic Nazi-official Amon
Goeth; his body language as well as his acting is so cold and realistic
that it really gives you the chills! John Williams&#39;s amazing
music-score brings involuntary tears in every viewer&#39;s eyes, and Steven
Spelberg&#39;s directing has never been (and never will be) better than
this. And let&#39;s not forget Thomas Keneally and Steve Zaillian who wrote
a screenplay that is probably the best one ever written. All of this
put together makes you sit through the entire film, even if sometimes
it gets so powerful that it feels like you&#39;re being punched in your
stomach over and over again. <br /><br />In short, &quot;Schindler&#39;s list&quot; deserved every Academy award it got. My
opinion is that very few future films will ever reach up to the
standard that it holds. It&#39;s a movie that everyone over 15 should see!
