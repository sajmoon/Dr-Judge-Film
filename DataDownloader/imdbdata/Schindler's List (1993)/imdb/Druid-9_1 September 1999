Spielberg is, and always will be, a master of manipulating your emotions.
Nothing shows that better than this movie. Parts of it are overbearingly
shot to elicit a reaction from the viewer, whether it be horror, shock, or
joy.<br /><br />That's also partly the reason why I dislike this film. It's not a very good
holocaust film. Pure Hollywood, even down to the black-and-white
photography, which lends a sense of unrealness to the story. This is not how
the holocaust should be told.<br /><br />Still, it is still good filmmaking. On the virtues of a historical movie, I
give this 8 points out of 10.
