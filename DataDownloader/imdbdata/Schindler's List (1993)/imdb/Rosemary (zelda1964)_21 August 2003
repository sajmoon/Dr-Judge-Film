In today's society, I feel that prejudice still exists in some form or
another. I saw this film and was fascinated by the script Mr. Speilberg
played out. What was interesting was the change of heart played out by Mr.
Neeson. Here we see Schindler, who had a hatred for so long,suddenly gain
conscience and then turn 180 degrees to be compassionate and caring. Mr.
Kingsley had a great part as the assistant and friend.<br /><br />If one asks for an educational film to teach about History, this movie is
a
great one.
