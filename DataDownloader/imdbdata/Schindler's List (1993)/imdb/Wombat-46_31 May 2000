This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Only Steven Speilberg
could
take an astonishing story of courage and determination in the face of
hideous oppression and turn it into a poorly made schmaltz-fest like
this.
Chief in a series of tacky, amateurish filming techniques is the legendary
&quot;girl in red coat&quot;. Having decided on black and white in an attempt to
show
that he can be serious about something, the paucity of Spielberg's
imagination is clear in that he can think of no other way to make the girl
stand out and be recognised - he seems to think that his audience is
incapable of recognising, say, a face, and has to hammer home the identity
of the girl by presenting her in an entirely different way from everybody
else in the film.
The monumental cheesiness of the closing scenes with the people saved by
Schindler goes way beyond the point of tackiness - just more evidence of
Spielberg's extraordinarily sentimental side sabotaging what should have
been a meaningful film.
On the plus side, most of the acting is superb, but on the whole the film
sensationalises the violence and oppression which it should have set out
to
attack.
Oskar Schindler was such an extraordinary man that his remarkable story,
which everybody should know, deserved far, far better than
this.
