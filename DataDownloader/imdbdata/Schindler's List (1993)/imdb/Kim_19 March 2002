I've just seen this movie for the first time last week, and I think it is
absolutely marvellous. As part of a project for school, I have chosen to do
the Holocaust. I decided to see this movie, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; because I
heard about it from many different people and I was interested and wanted to
see it. I think that I was touched when I saw it. It was sad and yet I
learned alot from it.<br /><br />I think Liam Neeson did an excellent job as Oskar Schindler. I give this
movie 5 stars!!
