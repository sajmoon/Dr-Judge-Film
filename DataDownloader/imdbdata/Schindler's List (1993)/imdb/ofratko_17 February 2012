There are almost 1000 reviews about this movie but I still have to
write mine. This movie changed my life. I firstly watched it when I was
14 and it was the most powerful movie I have ever seen. I cried several
times during the movie. Everybody should see this movie. It&#x27;s universal
and gift for all generations to come. Acting wise R. Fiennes&#x27;s
performance was one of the best I have ever seen and he deserved an
Oscar for it.Liam Neelson is great as well very subtle in his
performance. I believe entire cast was great. Excellent actors who
played their parts with passion and devotion.Some ppl don&#x27;t like the
black and white picture I believe it created perfect atmosphere in the
movie. If you haven&#x27;t watched you must at least one in your life
