The scene where Amon Goeth is on the balcony shooting prisoners:
As soon as he begins, they show his girlfriend in the bed saying in
disgust,
Oh, God.  Amon.  Pronounced it as A-Mon. Like the A in hay.  When he
comes
into the room she calls him Ah Mon.  Like the o in hot.
Surprised a hot shot like Spielberg didn't catch this.
