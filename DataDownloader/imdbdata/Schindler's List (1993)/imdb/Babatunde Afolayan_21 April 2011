I just saw this movie and tears rolled down my face unconsciously. I
could not hold back my feelings especially when Oskar Schindler said &#x22;I
could have saved more&#x22;. He said his car could have saved 10 more lives
and the badge another 2. One can imagine how valuable the funds spent
on intangibles can actually save lives if channeled the right way. He
saved so many, the list is the creation of generations, the novel
ascribed the list as &#x22;Ark&#x22; similar to the biblical Noah&#x27;s Ark. This
movie is the definition for all movies of its kind. No wonder the
director keeps winning Oscars and no wonder great movies are rated by
Oscars because one of the greatest men is &#x22;Oskar&#x22;.
