Some movies move you. They make you laugh, they make you cry and these are
good movies. I don't know if tiredness is an emotion but by the end of this
movie I was emotionally drained. I was exhausted. <br /><br />There are more Jews that owe their lives to Oskar Schindler than Jews that
live in Poland today, This is an extraordinary message we recieve at the end
of this movie. Extraordinary because of it's honesty. This man saved more
people than a country saved and this man was no angel, no prophet. He was an
average run-of-the-mill German.<br /><br />This story could have been one of immense sentimentality but it's not due to
the performance of Liam Neeson and the direction of Spielberg. It is easy to
tell while watching this that this is the movie Spielberg always wanted to
make. His complete and most important work. Spielberg can never reach this
standard again. Very few directors will ever reach this
standard.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is perfect. Neeson plays Schindler with just
enough power. We know this man is special but Neeson doesn't play him like a
legend. Fiennes is evil but humane. Kingsley gives a very touching
performance as the only Jew Schindler actually gets to
know.<br /><br />But this is Spielberg's film. His heart is in every shot. He knows how
important a film about the holocaust is to the Jewish people and he doesn't
let them down. A Jew himself, he associates with them and delivers one of
the greatest movies ever made.
