Steven Spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of
all time. Liam Neeson gives a great performance as Schindler and the
whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn&#x27;t matter
because the movie is so good. Ralph Fiennes makes an even better
performance as Goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen
with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to
do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. I read
that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but I think it&#x27;s a
classic and it&#x27;ll never go away. So if you want to see one of the
greatest historical films ever made, then go see Schindler&#x27;s List.<br /><br />EDIT: I wrote this when I was 12 or 13, and I&#x27;m so sorry about my AWFUL
English... Ah, well just have that in mind when you read this. =)
