I thought Schindler's List was a good movie it had good acting and a good
script. But it isn't that great like all critics say it is. I don't think it
deserved the oscar, and it was to long and the beginning was very boring.
Why do a lot of people like this movie better than Titanic which has more
action. I saw this movie in school and most kids in my class liked it but
some fell asleep because they thought it was boring.
