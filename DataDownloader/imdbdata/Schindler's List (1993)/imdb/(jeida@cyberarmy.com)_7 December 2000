Calling Schindler's List a &quot;film&quot; seems to bring it into reality.  A film is
something you may experience a few times a month.  This movie is not
something you may experience very often in many months.  To watch it is not
like watching a film at all, it is like living through something in your
life that consumes you, makes you want to no longer exist, and live forever
at the same time.  It is more like an event in your months, then a movie you
watched last night.  <br /><br />When people talk about how they liked this movie, some may try to articulate
the deep horror, hope and heroism purveyed, many will shake their heads and
say that it was beautifully filmed.  All will stop short, and just tell you
to see it.  It is impossible, perhaps, to sum this story up.  A movie is to
be reviewed and criticized, this, though, is something besides a movie. <br /><br />I will not critic it, I won't even tell you to watch it.  But if you do
decide to watch it, do so when you are alone, and when you have time
afterwards to be alone.  There are many stories with far greater personal
impact than this story, but none else have been made into something you can
rent at your corner store.
