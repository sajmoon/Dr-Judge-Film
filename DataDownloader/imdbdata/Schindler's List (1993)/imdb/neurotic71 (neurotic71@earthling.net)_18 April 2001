To me &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is more of a reenactment than a movie.  A movie has
something new to offer - some fresh insight to bring to the discussion. 
&quot;Schindler's List&quot; doesn't.  I knew going in that the holocaust was one of
the most horrific and disgusting chapters in the history of the world.  The
movie only served to reinforce what I already knew.  None of the characters
were developed.  We saw Jews suffering, but we didn't know them as
characters.  Their plight seemed just as distant as reading about it in a
history book.  The stories weren't personal.  The drama was just melodrama. 
The choice to colorize one extra that never speaks was ham handed at best. 
A real director could have brought focus to her without colorizing and
taking the audience out of the movie.  The movie amounts to little more than
just endless scene after endless scene of atrocities connected by the
thinnest shred of actual plotline.  Did it change my attitude about
anything?  No.  Did it reveal anything about the holocaust that I didn't
already know?  No.  It's a lot of money to spend and a lot of awards to
receive for a film whose ultimate message seems to be &quot;The holocaust was
really bad.&quot;  Well no kidding.  Even TV movies like &quot;Haven&quot; do a better job
of making the holocaust real in an emotional way than &quot;Schindler's List.&quot; 
In &quot;Haven&quot; you know the characters.  You laugh with them.  You cry with
them.  Then when you understand what they have been through the impact is
massive.  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; never engages on a personal level.  It is a
reenactment and nothing more.
