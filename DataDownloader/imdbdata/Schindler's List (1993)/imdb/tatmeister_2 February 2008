I watched Schindler&#39;s List a week ago in U.S history class, and at
first I thought &quot;Oh great!. I&#39;m watching a movie on the Holocaust in
black and white. How can this actually make me learn any more about the
Holocaust than I have in a textbook?&quot; My teacher put the tape on, and
the first hour was a boredom fest, but as the characters such as Stern
and Schindler develop their personalities, the movie becomes inspiring
and hooked. I then removed the &quot;boredom fest&quot; aspect of my thinking,
and transformed it into &quot;necessary story development/build-up&quot; At first
we think Schindler is heartless, but having a personality and morales,
he experiences the death of Jews firsthand. Of course, seeing such
mindless mass executions will boggle anyone&#39;s mind. Schindler, who
happens to be rich off of the Jews in WW2, helps them. The first hour
of the movie is devoted to making the last 2 hours as commiserable for
the audience as possible- making us feel connected to Schindler&#39;s
emotions. &quot;What if we were in his shoes?&quot; not only that, the movie is
an excellent depiction of the Holocaust. Black-and-white does the film
justice, as it gives the movie a &quot;WW2 feel.&quot; If it were in complete
color, it&#39;s effects would not have been as strong. Watch this movie if
at all possible. Emotions cannot be depicted by learning about the
Holocaust in a classroom- you are simply being educated about the
facts. Schindler&#39;s List reinforces this classroom learning by supplying
empathy with the facts. After reading about WW2, this is one of the few
movies that are a must-see. The acting, directing and editing is
marvelous. Only problem I had was the length of the movie.
