This is Spielberg's masterpiece. Most members of my family found their end
in the gas-chambers and so Schindler's list was a very personal movie to me.
Before seeing it, I never would have thought, that a director like
Spielberg, would be able to create such feelings of total distress,
desperation and hope. Only the ending with the jewish rites of the stones on
the grave of Schindler was a little bit disapointing. In my oppinion nothing
else than a bow to the box office.<br /><br />Schindler's list is a great film. It shows the holocaust as it really might
have happened and leaves you with a feeling of fear that it might happen
again in any country, at every given time.
