Everyone knows the importance of this film. Some of the moods and feelings
that this movie produces cannot even be put into words. But perhaps the
most
important thing I've seen this movie produce was in the person of Byron
Smith. Byron was a Lieutenant in USA's neo-nazi movement. He was your
typical tatooed skinhead. I met him during a prison visit where I was
doing
volunteer work. I have met many of these people and he was the most
devoted
and intense. He watched Schindler's List to prove to others that he could
do
so without being affected by the 'lies' it contained; Byron was wrong.
This
movie changed his life. Since his release he tours the country paying
visits
to skinhead and nazi groups with a DVD player and a well worn copy of this
movie. They listen to him because he still has the tattoos and knows how
to
reach these people. Take away everything this movie has accomplished and
changed save for Byron Smith and it was still worth all the money, time
and
sacrafice it took to create.
