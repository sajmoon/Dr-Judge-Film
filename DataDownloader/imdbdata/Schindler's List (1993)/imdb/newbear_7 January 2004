Friends, I hail from Czechoslovakia, former &quot;Boehmen und Mahren Protectorat&quot;
and I am familiar with some of the Jewish fates there, the citizens of the
town of SVITAVY NA MORAVE even wrote a letter to the president of the Czech
Republic, Vaclav Havel, to ban this 'movie', but to get the stock answer :
this is a free country. Those citizens simply objected to the fact that a
California Jew named Spielberg has cynically selected,(40 years after the
fact), this Gestapo agent victimizing Czechs in their above-mentioned town,
for a glorification attempt in a country where MATRIX and TOLKIEN
pseudo-religious stuff flies sky-high.
Well, the high schools of America, I take my hat off for you. You manage to
keep most of the budding adults off the payroll.
