I in no way make light of what this movie is based on. And that, in
theory,
is the point. Nobody will.
I think this movie, while perhaps mildly interesting; perhaps
stylish...Is
mediocre at best.<br /><br />This is a film dealing with the holocaust. A tragedy that touches us on
such
a great, and personal level, that making a film about it and having it be
critically acclaimed couldn't possibly be easier. The point is, that this
is
such an emotional topic, that anyone could make a film about it, and
people
would automatically swoon.<br /><br />I think Steven Spielberg knew this. And by adding the oh-so-dramatic
affect
of black and white, and selective coloring that no one could resist. I
found
nothing incredible about this film. It was alright, yes. But nothing
special. It seems that it gets far more credit than it
deserves.<br /><br />I say see the film, as it is a part of movie-history. But recognize that
any
shmuck with half a brain, and the proper funding could have come up with
a
film just as &quot;brilliant.&quot;
