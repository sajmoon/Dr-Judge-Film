There are many horrible things what happened with us human beings since
we are on this planet. Crimes, wars, terror, fear and death illness
sickness everywhere. The most things in our history are forgotten
because it&#39;s too lot for us. But, some things are still here in our
mind and life as a brutal portrait about what humans can do with
ourself. One of these happenings are the World war I-II. The terror and
brutality was never so perfect and planed. The story of the Jew&#39;s and
other innocent nations between 1939-45 is never to forget. Steven
Spielberg one of the best directors our time made an unforgettable
masterpiece with Schindler&#39;s List in 1993. The story of Oscar Schindler
the businessman who saved more than 1000 Jewish life at the end of the
German terror is more than a movie. It&#39;s a documentary of years full
with pain, fear and death. We can clearly see what happened in Europe
and most in Poland until WWII. Spielberg&#39;s directing art in his most
touching movie is phenomenal. The cinematography with the beautiful
heart touching music of John Williams and the powerful acting with
names like Ralph Fiennes, Liam Neeson and of course Ben Kingsley made
an excellent work. Everyone should see this to never forget and maybe
understand what can happen when mankind goes crazy.And if you can go to
Poland, You should visit Krakow and the place where the Jewish ghetto
was in Kazimierz. Or simply travel to Auschwitz where You can see
everything what happened. And if You are there, visit the unforgettable
memorial museum in Birkenau too. You&#39;ll return with something special
in Your mind and heart. It&#39;s called love and piece...
