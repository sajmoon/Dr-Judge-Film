Steven Spielberg's achievement should NOT be missed by anybody.
Everything about it is golden: the script, the acting (Liam Neeson has
played quite possibly the nicest guy in film history), the music (done
by John Williams, the same man responsible for 2 of the best film
scores of all time, for this and for the Jurassic Park theme: both are
epic, epic, epic and beautiful), the cinematography (handhelds give it
an authenticity, put you right in the action), and the accuracy (the
music, the dialogue, the accents, everything).<br /><br />If you don't know the story, Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a man
who employs Jews in his factory for free labor. Soon, he realizes just
what is happening to these Jews.<br /><br />The film has some great scenes, like the scene when water is being
sprayed into the trains. A small, but GREAT scene. At least, I found it
GREAT. It just shows Oskar's humanity and kindness amidst all the
terror and violence and agony...<br /><br />What makes the film powerful is not the violence, but its message,
which is very, very, very, very UNIVERSAL (no pun intended to the film
company responsible for the beautiful film).<br /><br />It doesn't matter what race, religion, or ethnicity you are: you MUST
NOT miss Schindler's List. It is one of the greatest films of the 90s
and of all time.<br /><br />10\10 Way to go, Mister Spielberg!! Bravo!!!
