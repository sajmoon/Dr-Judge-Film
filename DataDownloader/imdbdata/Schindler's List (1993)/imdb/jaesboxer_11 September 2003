The holocaust is one of the most horrific pieces of history we have. 
Because it occurred so recently, and was on such a massive scale, it is
important we understand it.  Schindler's List is Spielberg's finest hour,
the greatest film ever made on the holocaust and the most important movie
ever made.  Ever single person should be REQUIRED to see this movie.  It
shows the depths that humanity can sink to, the horrors of our race, yet
Schindler's List is about survival, about compassion, about the saving of
souls, the saving of lives.  It is a remarkable film, and a key piece to
world history.  The performances are perfect, the direction is superb, and
the story is one of the greatest imaginable.
