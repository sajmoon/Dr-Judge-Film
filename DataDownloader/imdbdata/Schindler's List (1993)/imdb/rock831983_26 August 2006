I hardly miss any Steven Spielberg Movie.But Schindler list was
released in 1993 and that time i din even understood any English muvys.<br /><br />Story: The true story of Czech born Oskar Schindler, a businessman who
tried to make his fortune during the Second World War by exploiting
cheap Jewish labour, but ended up penniless having saved over 1000
Polish Jews from almost certain death during the holocaust.<br /><br />Winner of 7 Oscar awards Schindler&#39;s List is story of Nazi barbarism.It
shows how mean the human beings can be sometimes.Its the most powerful
story ever told about barbarism and brutality.Even the words barbarism
and brutality are too less to describe what happened to the jews.Its
not only related what happened to the jews but its a slap on face of
humanity.How can we call ourselves human beings The duration of movie
is over 3 hours still it never losses its hold.<br /><br />To call Liam Neeson had given outstanding performance would be
understatement.From a greedy businessman to a humanitarian he is
extraordinary.His broke up at the end of the movie is so touching i
lost my words to define them.Incredible.I am surprised how he lost the
Oscar Ralph Fiennes have given his career best performance.Playing the
role of frightening Nazi commandant he just rocks.<br /><br />And Schindler&#39;s List only proves how great a filmmaker is Steven
Spielberg.From making movies like (JAWS) to close encounters of the
third world to ET to Jurassic park and recently released Munich and
many endless works he is &#39;God of all Directors&#39;.The way he have shown
the brutality and what had happened in past only a great ones like him
can do that.<br /><br />Many of you have seen this movie but i posted review cause i wanted all
to know what is called sensible cinema.<br /><br />With Spielberg&#39;s one of the best directed movies and spellbounding
performance by Liam Neeson Schindler&#39;s List is a must watch for
everyone.Especially for them who want to see sensible and meaningfull
cinema.<br /><br />.....A True Classic
