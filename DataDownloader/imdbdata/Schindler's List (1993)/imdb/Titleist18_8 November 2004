Schindler's List was by far the best movie of 1993, and it could vary
well contend for title of &quot;greatest movie ever made.&quot; This is because
it was made to portray suffering of innocents at the hands of sadistic
evil, and all that a lone good man can do to save them. Because this
movie is so well made, directed, acted, etc., it nails its goal, and
leaves the audience completely moved by the story it spent three hours
witnessing.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is tremendous, and winds up being crucial
towards capturing the story's emotion. 1993 Best Actor should-have-been
Liam Neeson, and Ben Kingsley, who should have walked away with a Best
Supporting Actor award, steal the scene as the heroic Schindler and his
good friend, right-hand man, businessman and (sometimes) sense of good,
Itzhak Stern. Their performances, combined with the evil Ralph Fiennes
injects into his role as the monstrous Amon Goeth, make for a film that
rises above any other historical drama and is placed into the upper
echelon of movies and masterpieces. The emotion, pain and suffering is
all real, and when you combine this with superb acting and flawless
directing, you wind up with a film that demonstrates completely the
passion of the Holocaust. Schindler's List moves the viewer in a way no
other movie has approached, it takes anyone with a heart and makes him
or her recognize their emotions and feelings on the matter. This film
is important, and should at some time be viewed by everybody.
