There's a small scene is in this motion picture that, in a way,<br /><br />actually speaks volumes about the film's subject matter.  It occurs<br /><br />during  the aftermath of the Krakow Ghetto destruction, at night,<br /><br />when the Nazis are digging out the people hiding in the buildings,<br /><br />hoping to avoid death.  One soldier sits down at an upright piano<br /><br />and starts playing, surrounded by the sounds of gun fire and<br /><br />people screaming and crying.  Two more soldiers stop in the<br /><br />doorway and banter lightly about whose music he's playing, Bach<br /><br />or Mozart.
     I think Speilberg here is trying to emphasize the fact that, even a<br /><br />supposedly  &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;educated&quot; group of people like the<br /><br />Germans could be coerced and driven to cold-blooded murder.  In<br /><br />this case, a young German man who no doubt had classical piano<br /><br />lessons as a child becomes part of a brutal killing machine.  It's<br /><br />small but chilling scene in a very powerful movie.
