As I am a 46-year-old male, there are few if any films that have been
able to physically move me to tears. The realism and format are the
absolute highlights to Spielberg's work here. But the overall sense of
pain and anguish are the storyline that so many people missed that
rated it less than five stars. I could expound forever on this film but
just want to share my reactions. At the end of this film, the pain I
felt could only be compared to the similar emotional exhaustion I felt
when I was going through a divorce that involved losing my children.
The uncontrollable emotion that poured out was frighteningly similar.
The tears would not stop flowing. This film brought me to my knees
emotionally and I will never forget it, ever.<br /><br />Thank you Steven.
