I just watched this movie for the first time tonight, and there is only
one thing I have to say about this movie, that is: &#x22;Why did I not see
this before?&#x22; That&#x27;s right, why did I not see this before? Schlinder&#x27;s
List is absolutely astonishing, it is an unforgettable masterpiece!
When this movie was over, I was staring at the television screen with
tears in my eyes, Steven Spielberg had done something incredible, he
had perfected a movie that is absolutely true to fact! This movie is
also very depressing, especially that a lot of what had happened in
this movie actually happened in the real world. If this was fiction, I
could have just shrugged it off, because it&#x27;s a movie. But this isn&#x27;t
fiction, this all actually happened, and that is what really makes it
sad and horrifying. Schindler&#x27;s List is astonishing, it is not just a
great movie, but also an excellent and unforgettable one. I am honestly
finding it extremely difficult to explain what a fabulous movie this
is, calling it a fabulous movie is an understatement, it is one of the
greatest movies ever made.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is a genius, one of the greatest film directors ever
to walk the face of the planet, a lot of his movies without a doubt are
masterpieces, this one being a prime example of his genius at making
movies. I also noticed that this movie had swept the Academy Awards, to
me, that is absolutely no surprise at all. Time to talk about the
acting, in one of his most well-known performances, Liam Nesson plays
Oskar Schindler in a realistic way. It really is a pity that the real
Oskar Schindler did not live long enough to see this astonishing
masterpiece, because he would have been astounded by it. Another actor
in one of his most well known performances is Ralph Fiennes. Ralph
Fiennes was something else, he played his character so perfectly that
it was moving. He could not have done any better, he was perfect for
the part, totally and completely perfect. So in short, fabulous acting,
fabulous directing, or fabulous everything make this an unforgettable
masterpiece. This movie is now without a doubt one of my all time
favorite movies.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen in
my whole entire life, and it is no wonder at all that this movie is in
the top ten in the top 250 on this website. This is a movie that is a
requirement, it is a movie that you must watch a one point in your life
as part of your movie education, because it is without a doubt
something extraordinary to see! I must warn you though, this movie is
very depressing, you may actually end up crying while watching it. I
didn&#x27;t cry while I watched it, but I certainly came close to crying.
That is one thing that is so powerful about a movie, if it can actually
make you cry. Well anyway, you have got to see this movie if you
haven&#x27;t seen it already, because you will be astounded by it. I&#x27;ll
repeat what I have been saying over and over again just one final time,
Schindler&#x27;s List is an astonishing and unforgettable masterpiece, one
of the greatest movies ever made. One last thing, when you watch this
movie, be prepared to expect the absolute best, because you will end up
getting the absolute best.<br /><br />10/10
