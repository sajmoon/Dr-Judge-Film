This is the best movie ever, so i give him a capitol 10!!!!!!! The best
performance, best music, best, score, best acting in one word THE BEST.<br /><br />For me the most touching moment of the film is the end, of course, the
word&#39;s spoken by Ben Kingsley: &quot;Who ever saves one life, saves the
world entire&quot; It is the most powerful line ever sad in a movie it has a
lot of energy, sadness, power, love and humanity. I don&#39;t cry after i
watch movies, because a i am not that touchy, but after this movie, i
let the tear go every time i watch the end of the film!! Today its a
movie everyone should see, maybe more than ever. This movie, along with
a couple of other should be mandatory in our schools, just so that our
kids, and the future generations never forget the atrocities that was
done to the Jews, gay people, Gypsies, blacks etc during that war.
