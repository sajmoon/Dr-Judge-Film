The movie is a slap in the face to the 150 million native americans who
died
so a place called Hollywood could appear and make it possible for people
to
make movies that are a slap in the face to 150 million native
americans!!!!
Where is their movie??  Where is a Ludlow Massacre picture??  &quot;The Emma
Goldman Story&quot;??  You want a fair account of
Mr. S.??  Watch reflections of evil.  I love the part where he visits
Schindler's List &quot;The Ride&quot; at Disney World.  Where is movie that doesn't
portray all Middle Easterners as hateful terrorists??  What about this for
a
movie??  &quot;How the Russians Won World War II.......and bailed out the
allies&quot;
I would watch it.  Schindler's List is a good movie, but it falls way
short
of being great.  I feel for a single person who dies in a conflict. (or in
anyway for that matter) But it is time to talk about the deaths people are
unaware of.  The Holocaust was a horrible display of how disgusting human
nature can be, but I want it to be someone else's turn to tell their story
of pain and suffering to the world.  We will always mourn those fallen
behind, so lets educate people about the dark secrets of our country's
beginning.  Or make movies about how our government actually used troops
against it's own people. (The Ludlow Massacre) Let's move
on.
