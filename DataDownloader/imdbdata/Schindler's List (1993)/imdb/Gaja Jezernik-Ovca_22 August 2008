I have to give this movie a 10. It is absolutely brilliant in every
way. The cast and crew couldn&#39;t have done a better job. It&#39;s the kind
of movie where you can&#39;t help but to shed a tear and yet everything is
showed in a shocking but beautiful way. I wanted to see this movie for
ages and I finally got a grip on it last year. And since then I have
seen it too many times to count. It&#39;s a masterpiece and my favorite
&#39;Nazi&#39; movie next to Der Untergang. It is difficult to make a film
about such a sensitive subject. I have seen many failed attempts and I
can&#39;t express my satisfaction with this one. It truly is a must-see and
I don&#39;t regret watching it all those times. It still amazes me.
