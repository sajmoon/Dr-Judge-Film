I could not imagine somebody  making movies in black and white in this very
high-tech age.<br /><br />But upon seeing the movie Schindler's List, in black and white, one could
not distinguish the virtual from real. Spielberg has successfully made the
film realistic.<br /><br />Setting aside the theme (which is contrary to some political and social
persuasion), the movie for me is a perfect 10!
