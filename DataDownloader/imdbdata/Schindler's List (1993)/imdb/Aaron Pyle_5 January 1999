This movie is one of the most emotional and gripping movies I've ever seen.
It accurately describes the tragedy of the holocaust.  It shows how
disgustingly evil people can be, what people will do to save lives, how
people keep going even through the darkest times, and it shows how one
person can change the lives of millions of people.  A wonderfully true-story
that is handled very professionally.
