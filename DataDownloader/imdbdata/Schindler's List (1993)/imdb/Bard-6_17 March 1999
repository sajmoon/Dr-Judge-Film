One can hear it, and still not get it; read it, and still not get it; see
the photos, and still not get; see the film, and I'm afraid, still not get
it. But if the raw emotion that came out of me upon viewing Schindler's list
was &quot;not getting it&quot; then it's as far as I'm willing to go to understand the
horror of this era. If war is hell, then the events portrayed here represent
that place where even satan is unwilling to set foot. It is hatred left
unchecked, or even cultivated into a fine tuned machine that reduces the
objects of hatred into nothing more than insects.
