The movies should inspire, and provide a view of things the way they ought
to be.  Schindler is both.  This is probably the most difficult movie you
will ever watch.  The liquidation of the ghetto, for instance, or the
shower
scene, are among the most heartbreaking images ever filmed.  Yet this
movie
might cause you to rethink the meaning of egoism when you see it
manifested
in this enigmatic man.
