Arguably Spielberg's finest film. The acting, direction
&amp;
scripting are all superb. Spielberg's films sometimes suffer
from being overly sentimental. Here he very wisely avoids
sentimentality letting the story tell itself.<br /><br />The unusual choice of black and white film helps here --
the
film would not have had the same atmosphere shot in colour.<br /><br />The protagonists in this story are all depicted as being
thoroughly human, a fact which not only underlines the
horror
of the Nazi regime -- these were real people, not comic-book
villains -- but also underlines the film's ultimately optimistic
message. Even when humanity is acting at its most beastly,
some
people will find it within themselves to resist this and
help
others escape the worst of it. As the case of Schindler
shows
(he started out simply exploiting the situation for his
own
gain) this may sometimes spring from unexpected quarters.
