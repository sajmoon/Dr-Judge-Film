First of all, I'm german, that's why I watched the movie from another
point
of view. I think you can't say this movie is good or bad. It wants you to
remember what terrible things happened in history and just think about
them.
It's very hard to describe for a german but everything showed in this
movie
is true, it's fact. There's no hidden message so you can really think
about
the things happening. After watching this movie you will never think about
the holocaust as you did before. I have to thank Steven Spielberg for this
experience...
