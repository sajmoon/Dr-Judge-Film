Schindler&#39;s List is a masterpiece. No one but Steven Spielberg could so
vividly and dramatically capture the essence of such a tragic time.
While the film begins with an amusing and charming twist, Spielberg
draws you into the reality of the events in a way that truly brings
them to life. He strategically bases the film from the point of view of
a man living a life of comfort and safety, not unlike that which we as
Americans live and take for granted every day, and showing us the
horror of the Jews&#39; lives therein. To the point and yet very fluent,
this film is sure to bring a tear to your eye, if it is given your full
attention. The harsh reality of a seemingly forgotten past lingers
still, and Steven Spielberg has brought the memory from the shadows.
