The mark of a truly great movie is defined by its cinematography, script,
characterization, acting, and directing. Schindler's List soars in these
categories.  A film of this stature leaves an indelible mark in our minds
and souls.  The haunting images of man's inhumanity to man juxtaposed with
the essential goodness of man linger long after the last reel
ends.
Each frame exquisitely tells a &quot;thousand stories&quot; with
their
great attention to detail, clarity, composition, and camera angle.
Coupled
with John Williams amazingly poignant musical score, each and every scene
infuses itself into our consciousness.
In addition to the incredible cinematography, music, and story, the
acting
was clearly driven by a deep and heartfelt conviction of character by all
of
the actors.  Especially notable performances were delivered by Liam Neeson
as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes.
In the modern age of special effects and high action
films,
this film renews the truly great creative potential of some of our
filmakers.  Mr. Spielberg took a bold step when he decided to finally make
Schindler's List.  Shooting the film in Black and White further emphasizes
the boldness and greatness of this film.  Like its great B and W
predecessors &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, Schindler's List
clearly takes its rightful place as one of the greatest films yet
made.
