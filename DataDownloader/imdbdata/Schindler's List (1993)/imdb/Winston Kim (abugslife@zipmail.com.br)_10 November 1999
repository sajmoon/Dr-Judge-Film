At last, I could really see the war horror.The film is black and white
but we can see the strong red of blood like Oskar Schindler  did. While the
Nazi guys were celebrating their conquers, the Jewish  people were suffering
and dying.<br /><br /> Steven Spielberg received the Oscar for his brilliant direction, but
he deseved more than this because by his film, everybody could finally cry
with the jewish&acute;s massacre. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes reforced the story
with their interpretations.<br /><br />&quot;The Schindler&acute;s List&quot; is just a classic movie, that still gonna make
many people cry , seeing the wickedness of the Nazi.
