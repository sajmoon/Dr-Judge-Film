To say that this movie is &quot;great&quot; or &quot;horrible&quot; does not begin to define
the
purest form of emotion that can be drawn from a movie. &quot;Schindler's List&quot;
is
the closest thing to poetry that I have ever seen on film. I have always
believed that Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were both shafted in the Oscar
category, but Oscars are only one year victories. This movie lives on as a
testament to the most important event that has occurred during the course
of
the last century. If I analyzed how to write, direct, film, or orchestrate
a
film of this kind of magnitude, then I would know how to make classics,
which &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is. Steven Spielberg is an artist...both in
entertainment and in realism. This is a film which I have not seen for many
years and decided to see again to see if it had the same impact that it had
when I was younger. Now 21, I truly understand the message he was
attempting
to get across. It was that one man can understand the value of life through
the violence and pain that surrounded him as he attempted to profit from
it.
Seeing it again also re-established my acknowledgement that this is one of
my most favorite films of all time. A true 10 on my scale.
