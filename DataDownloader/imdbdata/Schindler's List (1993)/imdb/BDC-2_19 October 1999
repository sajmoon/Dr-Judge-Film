No film has ever been more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar.  In the
same
category with &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; in that it shows how one
imperfect human being willing to make himself available in the fight
against
evil can make a difference.  The scene near the end where Oscar Schindler
takes leave of his &quot;people&quot; is certainly one of the most profoundly moving
in cinema history.  If I could save only one film for posterity, this would
probably be the one.
