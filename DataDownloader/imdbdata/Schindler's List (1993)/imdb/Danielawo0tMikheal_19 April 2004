&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a movie so epic and far reaching in its impact that
one stops watching it and says, &quot;...so that's why film was invented.&quot;
Steven
Spielberg takes us back to the haunting horror of war-torn Poland and its
condemned Jewry during WWII in a film so impeccably well filmed and
performed there need not be any kind of &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; on the
part of the viewer. Liam Neeson delivers the performance of his life
starring as Oskar Schindler, a true person who takes pity on the
imprisoned
Jews and helps over 1,100 to safety. He does this against the will of
supervillain Amon Goeth, masterfully played by Ralph Fiennes in what in my
opinion is the finest theatrical presentation ever captured on film. The
film is primarily historical but beautifully touches at the theme of the
survival and triumph of the human spirit. Truly, the only disappointment
about &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is that not enough films such as this grace our
lives. END
