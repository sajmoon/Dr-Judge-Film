I felt sad after I had seen this film. I think who make fun of Jew, is
an idiot. Or how would you feel like in a gas chamber. Its not funny if
you smother in a gas chamber. I think these people had not earn the
Oscar in vain as best Art Direction Set Decoration: Allan Starski, Ewa
Braun best Cinematography: Janusz Kaminski best Director: Steven
Spielberg best Film Editing: Michael Kahn best Music, Original Score:
John Williams best Picture: Gerald R. Molen,Branko Lustig best Writing,
Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium Steven Zaillian So I
think I had all Oscars winner writing down. And its the best drama and
the best film of Steven Spielberg.
