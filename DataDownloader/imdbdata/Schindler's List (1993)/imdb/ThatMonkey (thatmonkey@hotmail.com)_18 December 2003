I couldn't believe how this movie took me in. I didn't think the struggle
of
the Jewish people would move me. In addition I didn't think that the
combination of black and white film and three plus hours of film would be
good, but this title proved to be a soul searching work of art. I bought
this film after seeing it, that's how good it was.
