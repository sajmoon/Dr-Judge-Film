     This is a powerful and important film.  However, I thought the ending
was an artistic letdown. Spielberg should have ended the movie 10 minutes
earlier when the war was over and taken &quot;Shane&quot; as a model for his ending. 
Remember Shane? The hero rides into the sunset --or is it sunrise? --
unrewarded, unheralded -- punished, in fact, for his heroism.  That's how
Schindler's List should have ended, with Schindler walking into the shadows
and fade to darkness.  Virtue is its own reward. We don't need an award's
ceremony to tell us this guy was a hero.
