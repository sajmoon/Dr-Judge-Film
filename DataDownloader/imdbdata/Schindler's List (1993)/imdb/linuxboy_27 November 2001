Schindler's List is not my favorite movie of all time, but it must be
considered as one of (if not) the greatest films ever made. It starts slow
and builds and builds. After five minutes it will not let you go until the
end. The actors with the actual people they portrayed was a nice
touch.<br /><br />The girl in the red coat was a true master work. One single identifiable
story amonst the fog of war and atrocity. It made the entire envent more
personal and gripping.<br /><br />If you have not seen it you must. At least once.
