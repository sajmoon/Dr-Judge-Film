&quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; was THE movie of 1993, and nothing came close to
touching it in acclaim. It felt like the movie Steven Spielberg had
been waiting years to make, and despite his previous efforts at making
movies for grown ups (&quot;The Color Purple&quot;), this is the first movie that
suggested he was maturing as a film maker.<br /><br />So does it hold up after all these years? Mostly. But is it a typical
Spielberg movie? Most definitely. The first 3/4 of the film are
compulsively watchable and entertaining, if you can consider brutal and
graphic scenes of concentration camp violence entertaining. Spielberg
uses a near-documentary style that fits the material perfectly, and
using black and white with only occasional splashes of color feels like
an inspired decision. But boy is that last quarter of the film
schmaltzy, and has Spielberg&#39;s gooey fingerprints all over it. I don&#39;t
know that something as horrific as the Holocaust needs a lot of
emotional embellishment, but Spielberg just can&#39;t help himself.<br /><br />However, I forgive Spielberg in this particular case. This was
obviously a story that meant a great deal to him, and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s
fair to expect him to remain emotionally distant from it. He tells his
story with a great deal of passion, and for the most part he tells it
very well.<br /><br />Grade: A
