I can't possibly describe with words how great &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is.
You can't realize it unless you watch it. Spielberg not only makes you
feel like you're in the middle of it, but you continue feeling that way
for hours after watching the movie. Liam Neeson does a top-notch job as
Oskar Schindler, a man caught between loyalty to his government and the
desire to save over 1,000 people. Equally good is Ben Kingsley as
Itzhak Stern, whom Schindler saves from getting exterminated, and then
helps Schindler save more people. And Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a
Nazi Kommandant with plans to rape a Jewish woman. Like I said, I can't
possibly describe how great this movie is. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO
UNDERSTAND IT. 11/10.
