&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever
seen! Steven Spielberg is a great director! Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley (the
&quot;Gandhi&quot; star), and Ralph Fiennes are great actors! Neeson stars as Oskar
Schindler a Nazi Czech/German businessman who owns a factory. He saved more
than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during
the Holocaust. The film is sad, but it is based on a true story.
&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a movie that won 7 well-deserved Academy Awards
including Best Picture. Brilliant!<br /><br />10/10 stars!
