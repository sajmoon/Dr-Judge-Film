SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) **** Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes,
Embeth Davidtz. Powerful interpretation of Thomas Keneally's novel
about the true-life story of German factory enterepreneur Oskar
Schindler (portrayed superbly by Neeson, warts and all, and nominated
for Best Actor), who saved hundreds of Jews from the Nazis during WWII,
by employing them in his war-profiteering enterprise. Excellent acting
by the entire cast, specifically Fiennes (Best Supporting Actor
nominee) as Amon Goeth, a remarkably complex portrayal of nuanced evil.<br /><br />Deservingly bestowed with 7 Oscars (including Best Picture), this
harrowing documentary-styled monument to the travesties of the
Holocaust is Steven Spielberg's (Best Director) masterpiece and is a
must see. Shot in starkly haunting black and white by Academy
Award-winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. One of the greatest
motion pictures ever made.
