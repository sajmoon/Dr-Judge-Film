<br /><br />I enjoyed certain things about SL.  The story is quite good.  Technically,
the movie is very good.  The acting is fine.<br /><br />But, seeing how this film stays near the top of the &quot;top 250&quot;, I feel
compelled to rain on the parade a bit.  Forgive me if I use this forum to
focus on what I *didn't* like about the movie:<br /><br />The scene at the train station--remember?  Where people were scrawling
their
names on their luggage, and loading it onto boxcars on another line, then
the audience is let in on the fact that the system had no intention of
reuniting them with their belongings?--set the tone for the representation
of evil that was the holocaust.  It appeared that the immensity of the
tragedy would be conveyed in this movie by equally grand and hauntingly
indirect scenarios like this.  But then the movie settles into what I call
the &quot;clean death&quot; of countless shots to the head.  I'm not saying that
they
should have shown the knee deep typhus-dead in abandoned barracks, an
actual
gassing, etc., etc.  But the power of that train station scene
subsequently
wasn't matched by what came after.<br /><br />I also felt that the &quot;little girl in the pink coat&quot; was a victim &quot;for the
rest of us&quot;; a furtive hedging-of-the-bets which I have a funny, funny
feeling might have been more-or-less foisted upon Spielburg by his
producers.  When we got tired of seeing Jews getting herded up and killed,
the pink coat girl (who appeared to be a kind of goyim &quot;innocent
bystander&quot;)
sort of &quot;freshened our palates.&quot;  And I think that's a poor substitute for
more of the kind of effective and deeply moving stuff I alluded to above
(the train station scene).<br /><br />If you want your gut blown re the holocaust, watch Shoah.
