It&#39;s been a long time since i&#39;ve seen this movie so i can&#39;t remember it
correctly.What i DO remember is some bad aftertaste.Why?Well i can
hardly explain. It&#39;s a scene that can ruin a whole movie.For me it was
when Schindler says something like this &quot;i could have saven more&quot;.Well
it&#39;s maybe because i watched it in German ,but i couldn&#39;t believe the
actor.I think it was overacted.But i have to say it&#39;s one of the better
Steven Spielberg movies.If you really want to see a bad movie you
should watch &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.Also good performances by
Neeson,Kingsley and especially as always Ralph Fiennes.I liked that
scene when Schindler is trying to take influence on Goethand says
something like &quot;the power lies in the ability to pardon&quot;.Well we know
what happened... .
