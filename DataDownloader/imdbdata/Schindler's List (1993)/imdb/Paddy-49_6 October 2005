I am not really one for lists of the &quot;top ten&quot; anything. Is Wizard of
Oz a better film than Citizen Kane? How can you compare two such
different movies? But it does seem to me that &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is in
a class of its own. More recent films like &quot;The Pianist&quot; have tackled
the same subject well, but nothing can quite compare with Steven
Spielberg's triumphant presentation of Thomas Kenealy's great book. <br /><br />Perhaps the test of greatness is to answer some questions:<br /><br />&#149; Does the story matter? &#149; Is it real (true) or believable? &#149; Does it
touch all the emotions? &#149; Are there lessons to be learnt? &#149; Are the
performances strong? &#149; Are the settings realistic and credible? &#149; Are
the characters true to life? (Heroes we can learn from; Villains we can
comprehend) &#149; Does the film have the capacity to change the way we look
at the world?<br /><br />To me &quot;Schindler's List&quot; scores more highly than any other film on all
of these criteria. It is a truly great movie.
