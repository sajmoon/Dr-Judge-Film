Two words: simply amazing.  That is the just one compliment helping to
describe this riveting and unbelievably well-made movie.  Spielberg is the
only man to direct this movie and he does an impeccable job showing some of
the horrors of the Holocaust.  I also loved the fact that Spielberg does not
try to explain the change in Schindler.  He just lets it flow through the
movie.  This is a brilliant masterpiece and on my list of top 5 movies of
all time.  Everyone should see this movie, not just the Jewish men and women
whose relatives were involved.
