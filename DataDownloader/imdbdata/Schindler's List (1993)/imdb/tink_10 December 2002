Warning, I am one of those Jewish people who has never been so offended in
my life. This film shows that Speilberg cares only about likeable characters
and whimsy. What a copout! Jews in this film are only shown as rambling
ethnicities in tableau shots.<br /><br /> Speilberg would rather take a German Gentile, ficitonalize his story (that
speech he gives at the end as Schindler is about to leave and Stein gives
him the ring was made up, it is historically incorrect and totally made up)
and make a movie about the Holocaust from that point of view. My
grandmother, who was a Holocaust survivior, walked out in tears from the
theatre claiming his film was all lies.<br /><br />Spielberg makes lovely shots, just beautifully photographed, of violence.
This is suppose to make us feel the pain, to feel the irony and all it
really does is fetishize violence.  We don't learn anything about the jews
in this film so it doesn't even hurt that much.<br /><br /> Historically incorrect, Speilberg has the nerve to send the Jews to
Auschwitz until Schindler can fix the mistake. UM excuse me by the time
Schindler had a list, Auschwitz was practically empty and was no longer
gassing bodies. If you want a real look at the holocaust, look at the
footage actual nazi soldiers shot in the camps. Or read books by the
surviovors. Don't watch Schindlers List because all you will get is a
redemption story, designed to make us feel as if we too, like Schindler,
would save the Jews. It's embarrassing and inaccurate. How dare Spielberg
bastardize the pain my heritage, my family, and other Jewish families went
through, make it historically inaccurate and then give it to schools around
the country? Yep, thats cool.
