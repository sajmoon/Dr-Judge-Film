I enjoyed this film. Jack Black can actually act. Who knew? And Steve
Martin hasn&#x27;t done anything this appealing since &#x22;Shopgirl.&#x22; It&#x27;s got
some funny moments, and at least two laugh-out-loud moments, but mostly
it&#x27;s a movie with heart. And Black&#x27;s character will tug at yours a
little. Beautifully shot and sharply edited. Lovely scenery and
wonderful music. I hope this is still in theaters at Thanksgiving,
because it would be the perfect family outing (after devouring the
Butterball species). The audience in my theater enjoyed it and some
even applauded at the end. Eight is an honest vote, though I was
tempted to give it a nine.
