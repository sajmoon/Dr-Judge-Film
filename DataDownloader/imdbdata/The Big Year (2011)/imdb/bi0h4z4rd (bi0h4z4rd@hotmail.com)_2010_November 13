We saw a screening of this movie earlier this week and I must say, it
was funnier than we thought it would be. For those of you who liked the
movie, &#x22;STRANGE WILDERNESS&#x22; (where Steve Zahn and his film crew go on a
hunt while competing to be the first ones to film big foot), than
you&#x27;ll love this movie. It&#x27;s starring Jack Black, Owen Wilson &#x26; Steve
Martin. All three (known as &#x22;bird watchers&#x22; go on a quest to find the
most species of birds. However, if you do it for a year than it&#x27;s an
actual bird watching competition known as &#x22;The Big Year&#x22;, and of
course, everyone denies they&#x27;re doing a &#x22;Big Year&#x22;.<br /><br />To sum it up real quick, it&#x27;s about Jack Black teaming up with Steve
Martin (who both play the protagonists) to beat the high score and
reigning/defending champion of 737 birds, Owen Wilson, who is the
antagonist in this movie. He lies, cheats, slows others down so he can
be first &#x26; takes any advantage he can to be the first person to see or
photograph a bird. The person who see&#x27;s the most birds during the big
year wins a title of &#x22;The Best Bird Watcher of the world&#x22;. <br /><br />Wilson does an excellent job playing the antagonist and it had the
entire theater cracking up and laughing from start to finish. It has
one F word and two S words in it, besides that, sex or violence and is
recommended for the whole family. I am 100% confident that it&#x27;ll be
rated PG-13.<br /><br />I give it *** out of *****.
