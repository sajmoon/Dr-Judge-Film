Winners are grinners, and everyone won, in some way. The actors, the
audience, and the characters.<br /><br />As others have written, this is not your typical Jack Black, Steve
Martin or Owen Wilson movie, although Owen Wilson doesn&#x27;t stray far
from some of his other characters.<br /><br />The romantic interest (Rashida Jones) was delightful, and (not having
read the book) I thought that she was secretly going for a Big Year
herself, so the plot was twisted in my mind to that effect (not a bad
thing). Anjelica Huston has a cameo that adds quite a bit to the
comedy.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was a great movie which presents the everpresent
challenges of attaining your dreams, balancing your obsessions /
hobbies with the important things in life - which are yours to
determine - not anyone else. <br /><br />Funny, not irreverent. Beautiful, and not overpowering dramatic, but
with some drama. <br /><br />Well-worth watching on the big screen.
