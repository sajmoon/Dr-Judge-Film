Never in a million years did I ever think that I would be watching a
film about people watching birds. The activity of birding (formally
known as bird watching) was entirely a new concept to me. I had never
heard of such a thing as &#x22;The Big Year&#x22; contest and the fact that it is
based on the honor systems really blows the mind (and the conscience).
Before I delve into the actual film contents I just want to say that I
recognize Jack Black (Brad Harris), Steve Martin (Stu Preissler) and
Owen Wilson (Kenny Bostick) as exceptional actors. They all added their
own style and comedic relevance to the film. If you consider yourself
an avid &#x22;birder&#x22;, then I think that you would have a deeper
appreciation for this film than those of us who are not all that
interested. The only bird that I have found to be fascinating is the
hummingbird (which is the only bird that has the ability to fly
backwards). I also have a tattoo of one on my right thigh which shows
that I truly love this bird, other than that, not really interested in
birds that much. Some of the scenery depicted in this film was truly
breath-taking and it did take you to places that you would not
ordinarily think of when looking for birds. There were plenty of
supporting actors in the film including Anjelica Huston (Annie Auklet)
and Brian Dennehy (Martin Harris). I do not think that this was
Director David Frankel&#x27;s best work. I enjoyed &#x22;The Devil Wears Prada&#x22;
much more. It would have been a kick if some time during the film, a
flock of animated Angry Birds went screeching across the screen. Now
that would have been hilarious. Sometimes I think that I have a really
weird sense of humor, but oh well. Although I found this film to be
rather mild-mannered, the actors gave credence to the film and made it
kind of interesting to watch. If you are bored and want to have a
relaxing couple of hours out of the house, then I recommend that you
take flight and go and see this film. However, if you are not
interested in birds all that much, but want to see the top-notch actors
interact, then wait until it comes out on DVD. This film gave me a
rather Luke-warm feeling when it was over and for that reason I am
giving this film an amber light.
