The Big Year was great! We didn&#x27;t see it at the theater because the
previews didn&#x27;t look that good. They were wrong! This movie was very
well done, flowed well with good dialog and good character evolution.
It is a great family or date movie and I encourage people to rent or
buy it and get it its just dues! It was underrated and deserves
attention! Jack Black was great with his usual vulnerability, not
taking himself too seriously, but seriously enough to put you in his
court. Steve Martin was a genius, as usual. His scene with his new
grandson brought back nostalgic feelings to the Father of the Bride
Movies. Owen Wilson was smooth and funny! The supporting characters
really were great too and I hope to see them in other movies with
bigger parts! A must see!
