seriously.... before i watched this movie, i didn&#x27;t know that there is
a competition such big year. And i did a double check about big year.
Well, there is big year hahaha.... I&#x27;m sorry about that. haha But still
I&#x27;m wondering; do they really take 300 pictures of birds? <br /><br />What a nice idea that the movie is about birding issue. This movie gave
me such knowledge; about bird species. The movie was also funny,
entertaining and i love the message behind it; friendship, trust,
motivation, and perseverance. The cinematography was really nice.
However i hate the computerize bird, looked so fake. i thought
Hollywood movie can make it more real.
