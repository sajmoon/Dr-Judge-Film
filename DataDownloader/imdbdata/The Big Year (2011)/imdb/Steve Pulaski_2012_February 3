Birding is one of the strangest, yet most expensive sports I know of.
Yes, I said sport. By definition, birding (or bird-watching as many
people say) is a sport. It has competition, a scoring system, teams,
and a simple goal. Those are some of the bare-basics requirements for a
sport. Birding has everyone of them.<br /><br />Why is it that Birding is mocked and not considered a sport? I suppose
it&#x27;s the idea. I mean, birdwatching doesn&#x27;t sound like a sport. It
sounds like a hobby or an activity. Some people take the exercise very
seriously. It&#x27;s not just a hobby to them, it&#x27;s an ordeal. I think in
order to be a Birder, at least a successful one, you need to be retired
and/or wealthy (preferably both). You must travel across the globe in
search of all kinds of species, spending money on food, hotels, and
tourist attractions. It&#x27;s a tiresome event, and for all that trouble, I
don&#x27;t see why it isn&#x27;t a sport. It hurts the most valuable part of most
peoples&#x27; bodies - their wallets.<br /><br />In my art class months back, I was engaged in a heated debate about
Birding with four others. I brought up The Big Year, hoping to just
mention a few things about it before moving on, and it lead to almost a
fifty minute discussion on why Birding is/isn&#x27;t a sport. At the time, I
said it wasn&#x27;t a sport. I was close-minded to the idea of what
qualifies something as a sport. One person stated &#x22;competition.&#x22; I knew
right off the bat that was simply way too broad of a definition. That
would mean you and a friend racing to get a seat in class would be a
sport. Does that sound right? I finally came to my senses and now
consider Birding a sport. In the sport, there is such thing as going
for &#x22;a big year,&#x22; which is where our film, The Big Year, comes in. A
big year is attempting to see the most birds in one single calendar
year. The record is currently held by Kenny Bostick (Wilson) at 732
birds. He is a pompous, arrogant man who cares little about his wife,
who desperately wants a child, and more about Birding.<br /><br />Stu Preissler (Martin) is a CEO of a company, and retires so he can
pursue his dream of winning a big year. Preissler is energetic, cheery,
and the typical character perfect for Steve Martin&#x27;s persona. Lastly,
we have Brad Harris (Black), an amateur Birder looking to win the big
year as well. He takes a lengthy leave from his job to also follow his
heart.<br /><br />The film doesn&#x27;t give us a regular plot. Just characters that occupy
eclectic personalities that are thrown together to create chemistry.
The result, like many other comedies, works quite well. If one pays
close attention, they will see the families of the three characters
have drastically different opinions of the idea of this sport. Your
response to Birding will usually depend on how receptive you are to the
idea of venturing across the country to see as many birds as possible
in one year.<br /><br />Kenny&#x27;s wife is a long suffering woman, tired of being married to a man
who is rarely ever there for her. When he is there, he is easily
distracted by the news of more birds, which more often than not results
in his abrupt leave. Stu&#x27;s wife is very supportive of his choice to
follow the birds. She wants him to win and always forces him to &#x22;spot a
rare one for her.&#x22; Now, Brad&#x27;s parents have the most common reaction;
they find the sport to be ridiculous, cockamamie, and a waste of time
and money. At least the father does. The mother is quietly supportive.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know how much of a kid&#x27;s movie this is, though. I was
entertained, but felt the film sort of pushes the envelope for a PG
film. It has a bit more language than I&#x27;m used to seeing in a film with
the rating, and for that matter, I suggest viewers be about nine and
up. The Big Year, also, proved to be a colossal miscalculation. Its
ambition was to be a delightful, charming kid&#x27;s film, marketed by the
big name actors. Unfortunately, the film&#x27;s earnings were meager and the
response lukewarm.<br /><br />The problem is in the market, obviously. Birders are few and far
between. Kids won&#x27;t likely be amused by the idea of birdwatching, and
grow tired and weary of the concept early on. The humor is light, but
the heart is there. The actors are playing the roles they were born to
play, with the exception of Owen Wilson who gives the villain role a
try.<br /><br />The Big Year is charming and commendable in its efforts. It&#x27;s a
seriously eclectic film for the mainstream audiences, and a joyous
excursion for those anticipating the performances. The film provides
insight on an underrated sport, but doesn&#x27;t force you to like it. It
allows you to walk out of it with your own thoughts, instead of
persuading you a certain way. A rarity, especially for films that boast
an unfamiliar concept.<br /><br />Starring: Owen Wilson, Steve Martin, and Jack Black. Directed by: David
Frankel.
