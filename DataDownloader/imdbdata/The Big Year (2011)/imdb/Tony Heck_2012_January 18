&#x22;I wanted to be the greatest birder in the world.&#x22; Stu (Martin), Brad
(Black), and defending champion Bostick (Wilson) have all decided to
the the &#x22;Big Year&#x22; (a year long competitive bird watching event). In
the middle of trying to become the next world champion all three face
decisions that are much bigger then the birds. I have said many times
that I think about 80% of the way you feel about a movie is based off
of expectations about it going in. This is one that I was not looking
forward to. A movie about bird watching with Jack Black (I have never
been a big fan of his) did not sound appealing to me. Halfway through
this movie (and Jack Black) won me over and I really enjoyed this. This
movie was about so much more then bird watching. Dealing with some very
heavy issues and as much of a drama as a comedy this is a movie very
much worth watching. I recommend this. Overall, a good movie and much
better then I expected. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d watch it again though. I give
it a B+.
