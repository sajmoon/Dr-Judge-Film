There are only 2 real positives that I can say about this movie. The
scenery is beautiful. It is a good clean movie, in terms of no sex,
hardly any foul language, and no violence. However, this movie was
billed as a comedy. I think there are only a couple of scenes that even
warranted a chuckle - forget laughing. There was nothing to laugh
about. It is absolutely, not a comedy, so don&#x27;t go see it if that&#x27;s
what you&#x27;re looking for! While the main actors are all good actors in
their own right - this was a waste of their talent. I would have gotten
up and left after the first 30 minutes or so, but knowing that Steve
Martin is so incredibly funny, I kept hoping.....I ended up feeling
like a dodo bird for staying!
