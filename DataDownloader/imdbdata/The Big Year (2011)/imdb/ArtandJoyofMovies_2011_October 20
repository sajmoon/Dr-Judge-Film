An all star cast delivers a fairly bird brained movie. Slight amusing?
Sure. A few laughs? Yes. But largely we are laughing at the dedicated
(professional is a huge stretch) world of birding. These are people who
could not play football, sing or debate in high school. Perhaps they
had good ears and could whistle well? Who knows. Birding is a bit like
stamp collecting, saw blade painting, or UFO chasing. Few people really
do it. Few understand the allure, and some may find it just plain
weird. Count TMG among the latter. Sorry. I am just being honest.<br /><br />Wilson plays Kenny Bostick, the world record holder for spotting the
most birds in one year. 732 to be exact. Brad Harris (Black) and Stu
Preissler (Martin) decide to chase the record or what&#x27;s called &#x22;doing&#x22;
a &#x22;Big Year.&#x22; We are taken on a whirlwind ride of beautiful landscapes
and locales from Vail, Colorado to Attu Island, Alaska. We are treated
to identifying birds ranging from the Great Spotted Woodpecker to the
Snow Owl. We also get some great music thanks to the Trashman&#x27;s 1964
hit Bird Dance Beat &#x97; but the song had much greater impact in Full
Metal Jacket (1987). Beyond that, this film just coasts along like a
red tailed hawk. Cute and semi-interesting, but not much more.<br /><br />TMG wonders if there really are 10,000 bird species out there? I mean,
to us maybe. But what about to the birds? Some distinctions are clear,
but are they really a unique species? We humans all look different,
however, we do not distinguish and call one a &#x22;long legged black-man,&#x22;
&#x22;a full-breasted redhead&#x22; or &#x22;yellow faced slant eye&#x22; or perhaps even a
&#x22;lard- ass-ed, bald whitey.&#x22; No. We simply find these to be
distinguishing descriptors of the singular, human species. Funny to
think animals might engage in &#x22;human spotting.&#x22; Maybe they do.<br /><br />The only real positive in the film was seeing Brian Dennehy in a decent
role as Jack Black&#x27;s dad. TMG says skip this film and maybe go out and
watch a few birds yourself&#x85;or go shoot a few. I can attest that my
buddy Steve makes an incredible, &#x22;full bellied Kansan pheasant&#x22; rice
stew.
