I think &#x22;The Big Year&#x22; failed mostly because of its leads, not in spite
of them. That doesn&#x27;t mean they do a poor job at all, on the contrary,
but it&#x27;s really a very confusing production when it comes to marketing
and expectations.<br /><br />It&#x27;s not a bad movie at all, it&#x27;s sort of cute in a low-key and
philosophical kind of way, but it&#x27;s not really a pure-bred comedy and
you probably won&#x27;t do much more than chuckle here and there. That&#x27;s
where the confusion sets in, because you have three very high profile
leads that are first and foremost famous for being comedians. And when
the premise is as obviously boring (to most people) as bird-watching,
you sort of expect it to be, ironically, hilarious. How would they ever
dare make a movie with something like this a main theme otherwise,
right? Unless it&#x27;s actually the opposite of what you think when
bird-watching is mentioned? I think that&#x27;s what most people expect, and
it&#x27;s not at all what they get. It doesn&#x27;t really help that the opening
title card (as many others have pointed out) is the funniest moment in
the movie, stating: &#x22;This is a true story. Only the facts have been
changed&#x22;. This sets the tone for exactly the kind of movie you were
expecting, but not at all for the actual movie that follows. For me it
took most of the movie to really get on board with what they were doing
here, and I have to say I nearly gave up halfway through. I think this
movie would do better being marketed differently and with less famous
comedy actors in the lead roles, even though they&#x27;re doing a good job
as it is. It really is a nice little movie, just not a very funny
comedy.
