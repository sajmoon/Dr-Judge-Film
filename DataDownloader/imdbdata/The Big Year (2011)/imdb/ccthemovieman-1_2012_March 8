I found this to a pleasant movie, nothing extraordinary but definitely
worth watching. It had a nice combination of humor, drama, melodrama,
suspense and feel-good qualities to it. It also was a treat for the
eyes as these &#x22;birders&#x22; go all over America looking for different
species.<br /><br />The three male leads - Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson - all
do a fine job and their characters are totally different even though
they have the same objective - become the man who finds the most
different birds within a one-year span. Naturally, this takes a big
toll on their marriages (one is single, but has his own problems with
his dad) and that&#x27;s the human side of this story. How do they deal with
keeping wives or dad happy with this goofy lifestyle? Well, one
succeeds and one doesn&#x27;t while one wins the contest over the other two.<br /><br />How all of that happens is interesting. The story moves quickly with
subtle humor and drama.<br /><br />For a low-key change-of-pace, I recommend this film as something you&#x27;d
probably enjoy.
