The Birders of the world must be a flutter with excitement over the
fact that a feature length film has brought attention to their passion.
I found a number of things fascinating about this story, including the
interesting fact that even bird watching can be a competitive sport,
that Birders travel all over the world just to get a glimpse of a rare
species and the fact that only other Birders &#x27;get it&#x27;. The trailer
depicted this film as a comedy, mainly I assume because of the comedic
powerhouse casting for the three main characters, Brad Harris (Jack
Black) was the quirkiest of the main Birders having such an odd talent
of being able to identify birds simply by hearing their chirp. I can&#x27;t
imagine much benefit to having such a talent outside of the world of
birding. Stu Preissler having ignored his passion of birding for many
years and spending most of his life in corporate America made him the
most relatable for me, but beyond that just the fact that he was played
by Steve Martin was enough for me. I have been infatuated with Mr.
Martin since The Jerk, so basically he can do no wrong. And Ken Bostick
(Owen Wilson) as the most obsessive birder or I should say the most
committed. This film actually falls in that crack of film making
between a drama and a comedy, it was actually more of a drama since
there were some truly sad instances that reflected how much had to be
sacrificed to pursue a dream of a Big Year. For it to be considered a
comedy I would have to laugh out loud more than once and in this case
the vulture sighting was the only time that I had an audible. There was
a very talented lineup of actors in this film, which kept me from
yawning throughout, the eclectic Annie Auklet (Anjelica Huston), the
longing of a non birding birder wife Jessica Bostick (Rosamund Pike),
the stand up boss straight man of Bill Clemont (Anthony Anderson) and
many, many others. The Birds Hitchcock reference was expected almost
from the beginning so it was satisfying when it finally came, I did
hope that someone would have spotted via binoculars or camera lens Big
Bird to take the comedy up a little bit higher, since he is the rarest
of all birds there is only one. This film definitely has a target
audience, Birders unite! I sat through the whole thing and I still did
not get the fascination, I give it an amber light.
