2011_November 3 
The Big Year is an OK watch. While it would seem to promise a different
kind of movie, the movie turns out to be as generic as its title.(why
didn&#x27;t they call it The Bird Year?) The premise of these 3 competitive
bird watchers going up against each other is offbeat enough to deliver
a different kind of movie--but the writer/director shoehorns in too
many things to try and make the men all &#x22;relatable&#x22; in an attempt to
appeal to as many people as possible--which is a shame because playing
up the quirks of all 3 guys would&#x27;ve made the movie a lot more
memorable. The film is just enjoyable enough to watch comfortably from
your couch at home. While it keeps you watching, you&#x27;re not really all
that concerned with what&#x27;s going to happen but the film does have its
share of nice moments throughout that the movie does grow on you while
you&#x27;re watching it. Its a likable movie in spite of its missteps.<br /><br />Jack Black overly narrates the entire movie (this had to be a decision
from a studio executive so that everyone who&#x27;s watching can understand
why the characters are doing what they&#x27;re doing instead of oh say
paying attention) While i liked his restraint here and his more then
sympathetic character (he would like to indulge his passion for
birdwatching while if possible also keeping his job and his decent
relationship with his parents.) the fact that he never stops narrating
to you is rather irritating. Owen Wilson is Black&#x27;s opposite here, as
the champion birdwatcher who has made it his complete and total life to
the point of ignoring the woman he wants to marry, and would like
nothing better then to continue being the champ of his &#x22;field.&#x22; He&#x27;s a
bit of a liar in that he&#x27;ll do or say anything in order to remain
champ, but if you wanna stay on top in a competitive field, you got to
take all the advantages. In between the two guys is Steve Martin--a
very successful exec who&#x27;s coming to the end of his career and would
like to give more attention to his birdwatching hobby which he could
never find time for with his career, and is so looking forward to his
new life of birdwatching. (he takes it up the way some guys take up
golf) The film is basically these 3 guys (all of whom are on a quest to
see who can see the most species of birds in one calender year)
bouncing off each other and trying to find a balance of happiness that
allows them to live their lives and indulge in their birdwatching
(which means being able to leave on an airplane or a bus for somewhere
where there&#x27;s a rare bird sighting at the drop of a hat) I liked that
the film doesn&#x27;t force happiness on its 3 characters--they&#x27;re all
allowed to take their time to achieve (or not) the kind of happiness
that they&#x27;ve been looking for their whole lives---all 3 are finally
giving in to their passions and doing what they love most in the world
and the happiness that they feel while driving themselves crazy trying
to shoehorn in their commitments to their various loved ones or jobs
feels quite real. What I didn&#x27;t appreciate is the judgment that the
film puts on Owen Wilson&#x27;s (admittedly weaselly) character for
continually choosing to indulge his passion for birdwatching over his
fianc&#xE9;e at every given decision when he has to choose between following
his passion or being with his love interest. (if you think about it--he
is being with his love interest--he clearly has more of an interest in
being the best birdwatcher--but no the screenplay has to stick him with
a girlfriend so that the audience won&#x27;t hate him either.) Jack Black or
Steve Martin don&#x27;t get that kind of guff for choosing to follow birds
but only because they&#x27;re seen as committed to their real world
commitments such as trying to hold on to their jobs or wives (in
Black&#x27;s case it would be trying to gain his parent&#x27;s approval by
finally doing something and sticking with it.) I understand that the
film is trying to have a &#x22;bad guy&#x22; so that there will be some sort of
conflict for the 3 men to engage in throughout the film (so that its
not just endless scenes of the 3 guys flying from place to place trying
to see birds) but even if Owen Wilson&#x27;s character is prone to lies and
playing dirty tricks on the 2 other men so that he can remain the
world&#x27;s record holder for most birds spotted in a single year by a
bird-watcher...i didn&#x27;t think the writer or director was right to judge
him as not as good a person as the other 2 guys for that. Just because
he withholds some key piece of information that would allow his main 2
competitors to maybe get the jump on him doesn&#x27;t make him a bad guy--or
even that his priorities are wrong--he&#x27;s just a different kind of
driven then the other 2 men are, and there shouldn&#x27;t be anything wrong
with that really. He&#x27;s also finding his happiness you know?<br /><br />The film as a whole is OK enough tho--the film rolls pleasantly along
but it never even comes close to building a comedic momentum which is a
shame given how much Steve Martin&#x27;s character would like to break free
from his professional world. (i don&#x27;t know if this is because Martin
wanted to play everything as straight as possible or if the
writer/director just didn&#x27;t think his character should be wacky) Can&#x27;t
really say that the film is especially memorable or funny, but it&#x27;s OK
enough that you can keep watching without it boring you. It more or
less kept me interested in its somewhat unusual storyline and that&#x27;s
really all you can ask for of a movie sometimes.
