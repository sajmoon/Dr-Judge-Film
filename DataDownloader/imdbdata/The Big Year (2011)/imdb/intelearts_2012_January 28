The Big Year is on the surface a well-judged comedy with Steve Martin,
Jack Black, and Owen Wilson, which does make it pretty sellable. And it
is a very nice comedy - nothing too manic or implausible: grown men
with an obsession for birds compete to complete the Big Year - to be
the one who sees the most varieties of birds in one year on any part of
American soil.<br /><br />What lifts this to another level is that is really has heart and
amazingly it takes you all over the States, and shows you, and makes
you appreciate, the 750 or so native and migrating birds that occupy
every conceivable type of landscape from sea to rolling sea. It&#x27;s kind
of the nicest ecofilm you&#x27;ll ever see - all mixed in with some nice
observational human and tips about male friendship and male rivalry.
All in all this mix makes for a beautiful gentle film that is easy
watching.<br /><br />I&#x27;m giving this a 9 because even though there are smarter comedies out
there, and there are comedies that&#x27;ll make you laugh more, I can&#x27;t
think of another in the past 12 months that was just this sincere and
good natured, and that&#x27;s a rare bird indeed....
