&#x27;THE BIG YEAR&#x27;: Three Stars (Out of Five) <br /><br />Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson star in this bird watching
comedy based on the book &#x27;The Big Year: A Tale of Man, Nature and Fowl
Obsession&#x27; by Mark Obmascik. The three play birders (recreational bird
watchers) each trying to outdo each other in a &#x27;big year&#x27; (a
competition in which birders compete to see who can spot the most
different species of birds in a single year in a given area, in this
case the U.S.). The film was directed by David Frankel (who&#x27;s also
directed such hit comedy films as &#x27;THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA&#x27; and &#x27;MARLEY &#x26;
ME&#x27;) and written by Howard Franklin. It&#x27;s not as much of a laugh riot
as you might expect coming from the combination of the three big time
comedy stars and it&#x27;s surprisingly clean and lightweight (coming from
the three big time comedy stars) but it is much better than the reviews
and box office might lead you to believe.<br /><br />The story is narrated by Brad Harris (Black) as he tells how he
followed his dreams, despite lacking much money, and competed in a &#x27;big
year&#x27; to surprising results, in large part due to the other skilled
birders he met along the way: Kenny Bostick (Wilson) and Stu Preissler
(Martin). Bostick was the defending champion and known for dishing out
a lot of sneaky tricks for throwing off his competitors. Stu was a
seasoned vet who becomes a good friend to Brad. The film follows their
heated competition as the three desperately try to outdo each other
while wrestling with the costs of doing so (mostly family problems at
home) as well.<br /><br />It is interesting to see Black in a pretty clean nice guy role that&#x27;s
not vulgar or buffoonish much at all. He&#x27;s kind of the central
character of the film and it&#x27;s biggest protagonist. Martin kind of
plays the same type of role he usually does, in these family friendly
PG rated comedies, while Wilson plays slightly against type by being
the film&#x27;s main antagonist (he still comes off as the same type of wild
card he usually does just a little more self centered and rascally than
normal). The movie has some touching human drama and strong character
development as well. It&#x27;s not quite as funny as you might hope (like I
said), with the three lead actors attached, but it is humorous still
(for the most part). The movie is pretty aptly made for it&#x27;s type and
there&#x27;s really not anything to complain about. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a
must see comedy but it&#x27;s not disappointing really in anyway either. The
reviews have been harsh and the dim box office results might also lead
you to believe the movie doesn&#x27;t have anything to it but it&#x27;s
surprisingly decent given that information. I think the marketing
ultimately cursed it financially and critics will always be overly
critical and somewhat absurd in the way they review movies. It&#x27;s a good
film, one I don&#x27;t think most would regret seeing.<br /><br />Watch our review show &#x27;MOVIE TALK&#x27; at:
