Hollywood&#x27;s idea of a fun movie circa 2011 seems to be one where people
have mindless sex with each other or spend the entire movie talking
about having mindless sex with each other. Love equals having a
relationship that lasts more than one night, and cheating on your
spouse or significant other is par for the course. How refreshing it is
to find a jewel like &#x22;The Big Year!&#x22;<br /><br />&#x22;The Big Year&#x22; is a delightful movie centered around three men at
different walks of life who each want to have a &#x22;Big Year.&#x22;. A Big Year
is birdding terminology for spending the year counting each different
bird species you see. The unattainable world record has been set by
Bostick, Owen Wilson&#x27;s character, several years before. But Stu (Steve
Martin) and Brad (Jack Black) feel compelled to try to beat the record.
This is something each man needs to do.<br /><br />Stu is a hugely successful head of a large company who wants to retire.
His minions feel that he can&#x27;t retire or he will be letting his
business (his life&#x27;s work) down. Brad is a divorced man in a dead-end
tech job who feels like this is his chance to give his life some
meaning. Bostick is defined by being &#x22;the world&#x27;s greatest birder,&#x22; so
can&#x27;t let anyone beat his record. He has to have another Big Year as
well.<br /><br />Going along with these three men on their Big Years is an absolute
pleasure. We have a lot of laughs together, and we all start to see a
little bit more clearly the things that are important in this life. We
also see the effect the Big Year has on those left at home (Bostick and
Stu&#x27;s wives and Brad&#x27;s parents.) <br /><br />Hollywood today feels that they need to always show us the Real World.
To them, the Real World is the very worst of society. People who use
only crude language and who can&#x27;t be faithful or supportive to their
wives and husbands unless their lives are going along in a perfectly
smooth pattern. Any upset is an excuse for leaving and/or cheating.
This movie shows a different version of the Real World where people can
be supportive and faithful even when things get a little rocky. It&#x27;s a
joy to watch!
