If anybody can provide me with a reason why this movie was made, I&#x27;d
appreciate hearing it. The only thing more surprising than there being
a movie made about competitive bird watching (birding) is the cast the
filmmakers assembled for it -- Jack Black, Steve Martin and Owen
Wilson! While they are not necessarily the biggest names in the comedy
world of showbiz anymore -- having this trio cast in ANY movie is
notable (let alone one about birds). Director David Frankel (The Devil
Wears Prada, Marley &#x26; Me) gives us a story of three different men
coming to terms with their lives (in three different stages of life) by
criss-crossing the country over the course of a year to observe a wide
variety of avian life (from rare-rare to common) in a bird-watching
contest known as The Big Year.<br /><br />Wilson (Cars, Wedding Crashers, Midnight in Paris) is the hot-shot
winner of the competition from the previous year and Black (King Kong,
Kung Fu Panda, The School of Rock) and Martin (Father of the Bride,
It&#x27;s Complicated, The Jerk) are casual-to-avid birdwatchers who dream
of taking his title from him. Flying here and there to catch a glimpse
of a bird sets them all up for various adventures, misadventures and
encounters.<br /><br />Rashida Jones (The Social Network, Our Idiot Brother, The Muppets) is a
fellow birdwatcher they meet on the road; Angelica Huston (The Royal
Tenenbaums, 50/50, Ever After) is a boat captain they are all required
to employ; and Dianne Wiest (Parenthood, Bullets Over Broadway, Rabbit
Hole) and Brian Dennehy (Romeo + Juliet, First Blood, Ratatouille) play
Jack Black&#x27;s parents who have differing opinions about their son
taking-up (the pointless sport of) birdwatching so late in life.<br /><br />By giving us three characters and their three different lives, the
movie hopes that it is providing a moral for the audience to follow ...
but since the movie is &#x22;just kind of here&#x22; we don&#x27;t get a whole lot out
of it. I&#x27;d hate to call it unnecessary and pointless but that is where
I am at with it: &#x22;so what!?!&#x22; This isn&#x27;t BAD by any means -- it aims
for a purpose; but it doesn&#x27;t achieve it because you feel so
indifferent towards it. It really is blah, blah, blah ...
