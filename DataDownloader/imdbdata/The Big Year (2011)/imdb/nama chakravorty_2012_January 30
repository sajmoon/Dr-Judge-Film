Based on the book The Big Year: A Tale of Man, Nature and Fowl
Obsession which was written by Mark Obmascik, &#x27;The Big Year&#x27;, Directed
by David Frankel, is One-Time Watch, that delivers routine
entertainment. <br /><br />&#x27;The Big Year&#x27; Synopsis: Three avid bird watchers compete to spot the
rarest birds in North America at a prestigious annual event.<br /><br />&#x27;The Big Year&#x27; is innovative, but it&#x27;s not memorable. Reason? The
Monotonous &#x26; Dragging Screenplay, that loses pace in the Second-Hour.
Howard Franklin&#x27;s Adapted Screenplay appeals in parts. David Frankel
Directs this Recent-Comedy, fairly. Cinematography by Lawrence Sher,
captures the stunning locales aptly. Editing &#x26; Art Design, are
functional.<br /><br />Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is not in his element. Jack Black is
quite good. Owen Wilson is the best of the lot, as he gets it right
completely. Rosamund Pike looks a Million Bucks &#x26; delivers a good
performance. Rashida Jones does her bit well. Anjelica Huston, Dianne
Wiest, Brian Dennehy &#x26; Jim Parsons appear in small roles. <br /><br />On the whole, &#x27;The Big Year&#x27; delivers routine entertainment.
