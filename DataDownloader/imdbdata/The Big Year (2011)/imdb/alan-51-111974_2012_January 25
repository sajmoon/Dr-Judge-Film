I&#x27;d rate this movie either 1 or 7. The 7 rating is based on this being
a quiet subversion of the American dream. If it&#x27;s not, then it gets a
1. This movie seems to be about the sheer futility of competition.
Three Americans leave their families, spend lots of money, burn lots of
fuel in order to count the species of bird they see. Having the biggest
number is important, even though this contributes NOTHING to anyone
around, especially their families who largely suffer as a result.
Perhaps this kind of selfish futility really is freedom, it doesn&#x27;t
seem so to me. The acting is great as is the cinematography. I would
like to believe that this movie is being ironic but it&#x27;s not clear.
We&#x27;re encouraged to believe that it&#x27;s OK for Jack Black&#x27;s character to
blow 7 credit cards on a mission to see birds... this raises the same
question for his character as it does for this movie... where does
passion become stupidity? When is it OK to say that following your
dream is just plain stupid?
