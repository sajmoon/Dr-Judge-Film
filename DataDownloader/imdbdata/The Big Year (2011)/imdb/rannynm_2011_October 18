KIDS FIRST! film critic, 9-year-old Anthony Aranda loved this movie as
did his younger brother. Here&#x27;s what he had to say: &#x22;This is a great
movie because it has a lot of interesting facts about a lot of
different birds. It is a really funny movie. The movie is about three
men who are trying to win a contest called The Big Year. They have to
find the most different kinds of birds in one year. Bostick (Owen
Wilson) is one of the characters in the movie and he won the contest
last year. He really wants to win again and beat his own record. Harris
(Jack Black) and Preissler (Steve Martin) really wants to beat Bostick
so they team up to help each other so one of them can win. The main
characters in the movie are Bostick, Harris, and Preissler. My favorite
character in the movie is Harris. I like Harris because he tries really
hard to beat Bostick and he won&#x27;t give up. He is also a really funny
character and makes me laugh a lot. For example, when a girl that he
likes ends up breaking up with her boyfriend, he does a victory dance
on his front porch. Then he says that he feels really bad for her (even
though he didn&#x27;t). It is pretty funny.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for ages 6 and up because it has some mild
language that is not appropriate for younger children. A lot of people
will like this movie though because there are a lot of funny parts. Go
out and see it in theaters when it launches on October 14th!&#x22;<br /><br />Link to Anthony&#x27;s video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?
