I love Jack Black and Owen Wilson. Jack Black was great. He makes you
feel what he feels in this film. He is funny, sincere and really human.<br /><br />Owen Wilson on the other hand was very arrogant. Wilson is a funny
actor but in this movie his god is birds. He shows little affection for
his wife and people. He is so competitive that is all he thinks about
and it makes him a very unlike able, not even funny.<br /><br />Steve Martin is funny, rich, has a loving family. These 3 are birders
who go looking for birds that are rare or not often seen for the thrill
of it. They are competitive though but Wilson is a brute. They want to
win who saw the most birds prize at the end of the year.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the lovely scenes, the birds, the
mountains and the love and kindness you feel from Jack Black, also the
love, kindness and support Steve Martin gets from his family as he goes
on trips with the two other birders, Jack Black and Owen Wilson.<br /><br />The two points I did not like a lot one was in the beginning. Steve
Martin yells &#x22;God D mit.&#x22; Another disgusting part is when dead fish are
cut up to give the birds and there are all bloody fish head on the
boat.<br /><br />This movie dragged on going back and forth. Short is better and less
arrogance from actors that are usually very funny and likable.
