I&#x27;m sorry, but I&#x27;ve to say that people&#x27;s taste in movies is getting
worse by the year. They seem to give high ratings to mindless movies
and fail to appreciate the good ones.<br /><br />The Big Year is a beautiful drama-comedy picture, starring 4 of my
favorite comedians - Steve Martin, Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Jim
Parsons. <br /><br />It is a touching and heart warming story, which has it&#x27;s comic points
and showcases most valuable life lessons - family coming first, the
price people pay for being the greatest in any field, choosing between
priorities etc.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a wonderful effort and it deserves a watch, and the a minimum 8
star rating.
