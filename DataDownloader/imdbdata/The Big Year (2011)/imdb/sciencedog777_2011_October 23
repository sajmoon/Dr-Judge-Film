There are a lot of great road films out there, but this is not one of
them. Steve Martin was great in Planes, Trains and Automobiles, but
this is one film I&#x27;m sure he won&#x27;t be adding to his resume any time
soon. The biggest disappoint is the cast. I love Jack Black and I liked
the Jim Parsons cameo, but not even these normally hilarious actors
could save this disaster. There is simple nothing funny about it. The
whole thing is a predictable mess. It&#x27;s as if someone was filming a
nature documentary and a studio desperate for movie ideas bought up the
footage and brought in big name actors in an attempt to make a road
comedy. The whole story is completely linear with no sudden twists and
100% predictabillity. It should be a crime to put such talented actors
in unfunny roles.
