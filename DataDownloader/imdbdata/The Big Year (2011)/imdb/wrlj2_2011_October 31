I confess that I cannot represent the following as an entirely
objective, nor representative assessment of the quality of &#x22;The Big
Year&#x22;. How often does one of the early scenes in a film almost
identically replicate an incident in the viewer&#x27;s life? My introduction
to the peculiar world of birding was in the late 1990s at Patagonia
State Park in Southern Arizona. We had unsuspectingly selected a
camping location that was noted for hosting an enormous variety of
birds, and were awakened one morning by a small army of odd looking
characters hell-bent on confirming the first reported sighting of the
Nutting flycatcher in the United States in several decades. Out of
curiosity we joined the chase, and the rest is family history, eerily
duplicated by the makers of this film. What followed were many years of
exercise, pleasure and reward for one of life&#x27;s most interesting
avocations.<br /><br />So... how could I not enjoy this fine effort at mixing the allure of
this strange &#x22;sport&#x22; with a thoughtful exploration of human motivation
and conflicted choices. I can understand why the faithful fans of
Black, Martin and Wilson might be disappointed with this production.
But I, for one, have grown infinitely weary of too many superficial,
sophomoric attempts at humor through these three capable actors. I was
encouraged to see the restraint and depth that they could bring to
these characters which provided the necessary credibility for this
otherwise improbable tale. The film maintains a near perfect balance of
humor, drama, and suspense in a well paced, engaging and uplifting
plot. The spectacular photography of an abundance of aesthetically
appealing locations is an added bonus.<br /><br />I count it a big plus when I can walk out of the movie with that &#x22;feel
good&#x22; elation that comes from a pleasant and interesting evening&#x27;s
entertainment. My heart said give it an eight or nine, but my
never-ending quest for realistic objectivity resulted in the
understated seven. Unless you are of the set that requires demolition
derbies and frat humor for your entertainment, go see it. You&#x27;ll have a
good time.
