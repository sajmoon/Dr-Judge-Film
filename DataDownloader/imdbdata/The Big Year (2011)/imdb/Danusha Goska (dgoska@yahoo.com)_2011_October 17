I&#x27;m a birdwatcher and a movie lover and I really didn&#x27;t want to see
&#x22;The Big Year.&#x22; The part of my brain that is rewarded by watching
movies is very different from the part of my brain that is rewarding by
birdwatching. In movies I&#x27;m focused on personalities, dialogue, and the
swift progression of a plot from A to B to C to its climax and
conclusion. While birdwatching, I don&#x27;t want to activate that part of
my brain. I want to forget other people, and not think verbally, but
rather in terms of shapes, colors, and movement. I want to lose any
sense of sequential time by focusing on the timeless beauty of a bird
in flight.<br /><br />&#x22;The Big Year&#x22; didn&#x27;t succeed for me as a movie or as a treatment of
birdwatching. I think the filmmakers tried too hard to make the film
normal and mainstream, and attractive to normal, mainstream audiences.
Owen Wilson and Steve Martin play two typical movie character types &#x96;
the kind of men you meet in movies but never in real life &#x96; with
typical movie character bland, blond, airbrushed, personality-free
wives. That was a mistake.<br /><br />Birdwatching, especially competitive birdwatching, isn&#x27;t normal and it
isn&#x27;t mainstream. The movie should have upped the quirk quotient and
really tried to get close to what it is to be a birdwatcher. A quirkier
film, truer to its subject matter, would have been a niche film, but it
would have worked better.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t believe Steve Martin or Owen Wilson, two actors I normally
like a lot, as birdwatchers. If I ran into these two out in the field,
I would not believe that they were birdwatchers at all. I did find Jack
Black believable as a birdwatcher. Birdwatchers are obsessive. When
birdwatching, we are totally focused on birds. In that, we are like
military commanders, or drug addicts, or those obsessively in love.
Martin and Wilson never communicated that focus or that command. Black
was able to work some of a real birdwatcher&#x27;s mastery, vulnerability,
hope, fascination and dedication into his part.
