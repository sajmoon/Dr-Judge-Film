Charlie Chaplin. A Visionary. An Entertainer. An Icon. A legend. Now,
is it easy to make a biopic on a person so talented &#x26; spirited? Richard
Attenborough, takes up the challenge to make a biopic on this
Cult-Personality, and to a large extend, exceeds by making a convincing
film.<br /><br />&#x27;Chaplin&#x27; is about the life of English comedian Charlie Chaplin, a man
who entertained billions of people. He was an astonishing performer. He
was loved. The biopic, tries to show the ups and downs he went
throughout his life. Right from the extreme poverty he faced, and to
how he caught on stardom and became the man he is. <br /><br />Biopics are not easy to make. After all, you will have to justify each
and everything happened to the particular person you choose to work on
celluloid. Richard Attenborough has directed the biopic very nicely. He
shows us the Rise &#x26; Fall of the late legend, with utmost conviction.
The adapted Screenplay, is neat, but I must say, that, it dips in the
middle. But a dramatic culmination comes out well. Cinematography &#x26;
Editing are perfect. Art Direction, is pure. <br /><br />Performance-Wise: Robert Downey, Jr. as Charlie Chaplin, is awesome. In
fact, Downey, Jr. proves his caliber as an actor, by playing a man so
famous, wonderfully. He lives his part in each and every scene.
Geraldine Chaplin and Paul Rhys are excellent. Dan Aykroyd is natural.
Kevin Kline is good. Kevin Dunn, Diane Lane, Sir Anthony Hopkins &#x26;
Milla Jovovich lend good support. James Woods &#x26; Marisa Tomei appear in
tiny cameos. <br /><br />On the whole, An Entertaining &#x26; Well-Acted film, that surely deserves a
watch. Thumbs Up!
