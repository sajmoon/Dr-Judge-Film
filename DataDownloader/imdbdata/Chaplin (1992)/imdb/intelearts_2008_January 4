For my money this is one of the weakest of Attenborough&#39;s catalogues.<br /><br />It does however have a HUGE saving grace in Robert Downey Jr who as
Chaplin the star is simply brilliant.<br /><br />I personally disliked the plot device of Anthony Hopkins as Chaplin&#39;s
biographer and found it quite irritating.<br /><br />While all performances are solid, especially Kevin Kline if you see the
Thief of Bagdad then watch this he really does capture something of
Fairbanks charisma and energy, the film is strangely the same: another
girl (Literally often) appears, disappears etc; it became almost
formulaic after a while.<br /><br />Great in its scope, and the sets, attention to detail etc; are good -
just didn&#39;t me the first time I saw it or this time - perhaps tellingly
the real Chaplin with the Kid at the end is magnificent.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching for Downey&#39;s tip-top performance as the young
Chaplin, but the rest is too linear and flat to make a great film.
