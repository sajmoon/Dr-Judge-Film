This is a great example of a movie I took a chance on one rainy
Sunday
at a theater in Charlotte, NC., and was highly rewarded with
an
intriguing look at the life of an early film star set against
the
background of early Hollywood.  I had't heard much buzz about it
and
didn't really know much about Charlie Chaplin.  Downey is
amazing
in his personification of Chaplin.  If you want to expand your
horizons
and learn a little about the inside workings of the film industry
from
circa World War I thru the 50's, this award-winning movie comes
highly
recommended.
