In Sir Richard Attenborough's film entitled Chaplin, he goes into the
life of a man who at one point in time had the most recognizable face
on the planet.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays Charles Chaplin, the slapstick comedian from
England. His rise to fame was not an easy one. His mentally ill mother
slowed him down and women became an issue later. With a great cast
including Anthony Hopkins, Dan Aykroyd, and Marissa Tomei, Chaplin
really takes us through the good times and into the real hardships.<br /><br />Downey's transformation into Chaplin is incredible. The movie starts
off with a much older Chaplin being interviewed by Hopkins at his home.
Then they go back and forth from interview to life story. Downey goes
from a very thick Caulkney accent to a very proper British accent. The
slow transition from young comedian to mature actor, director, and
writer is shown marvelously.<br /><br />When Downey becomes the tramp, Chaplin's most famous character, the
magic involved around it is perfect. It really is astounding how much
Downey looks like Charlie Chaplin. The way he walks, falls, runs,
looks, and just overall way about him is incredible. Downey captures
the essence of Chaplin.<br /><br />This movie received three Academy Award nominations for best actor
(Downey Jr.), best original score, and best art direction. It didn't
win but it shows the caliber of this movie. Chaplin is an incredible
biopic of a man not too many people know. It is one that would be a
great addition to any movie lover's collection. Charlie would be
proud...
