I don't know enough about Chaplin's personal history to judge this as
biography; I can't tell which of the scenes depicting the inspiration
for famous moments of film are based on fact, and which are authorial
invention. But even a casual acquaintance with Chaplin's work and
Hollywood's past is enough to make the reconstructed moments in this
film fascinating.<br /><br />The series of period vignettes covering an astonishingly wide cultural
and chronological span are not merely impressive; better than that,
they are seamlessly convincing. There is no question of costume drama
or striving for 'authenticity' -- we simply *are* looking at a changing
man in a changing world, without even being conscious of it at the
time. It is only in retrospect that we realise what a vast era
Chaplin's career spanned.<br /><br />The same, unfortunately, cannot be said of the aging techniques used
for the part of Chaplin himself, of which I found myself unhappily
conscious throughout. Robert Downey Jr made an utterly convincing young
Chaplin, an increasingly implausible-looking older one with varying
amounts of grey brushed into his hair, and a very obviously fake
seventy-year-old. The actor's body language tried hard, but the
cosmetics were just not up to the mark. Ironically, the continuity of
the various juvenile Chaplins was far more realistic; if I hadn't seen
the credits I could easily have taken it for granted that Downey had
played all of them from the age of nine or ten upwards!<br /><br />Others have commented on the performance of Kevin Kline as Douglas
Fairbanks: I can say only that he is quite literally outstanding,
leaping (athletically!) into prominence as one of the most memorable
characters in the film, despite appearing in only a handful of scenes.
For those like myself who know Kline only as the comedy heavy in &quot;A
Fish Called Wanda&quot;, this is a revelation. <br /><br />The main defects of this film I felt to be structural. It has too long
a timespan to cover, despite its omission of Chaplin's later career,
and becomes increasingly sketchy towards the end. It remains,
ultimately, no more than a series of period vignettes, although
extremely successful ones. Perhaps this is because the framing
structure, of an elderly Chaplin writing his autobiography with/being
psychoanalysed by a two-dimensional author character, fails to work. At
times Chaplin is given portentous sentiments to pronounce, but Downey
is not magisterial enough to deliver them with conviction. Meanwhile,
the intrusive questioning is so trite I could not help but sympathise
with Chaplin for refusing to answer on several occasions -- however
unwise it was to draw attention in this way to the absences in the
tale! And, as I mentioned, the aging make-up here is distracting.<br /><br />I also suspect that a working knowledge of Hollywood history may be
required in order to follow passing allusions to events from the
McCarthy hearings to the Fairbanks/Pickford menage without becoming
confused. Perhaps it's safe to assume your audience will be aware of
the First World War, introduced jarringly several years after its
outbreak without prior mention, or Mussolini, who gets a single
gratuitous reference to establish the period of one scene. But a
one-off namecheck of Randolph Hearst serves no purpose than to
frustrate any expectations of his future significance without conveying
any information to the uninitiated, and Mary Pickford is first seen
conducting an adulterous affair with Fairbanks and then divorcing him,
without -- confusingly -- any apparent mention of a mutual marriage in
the years between...<br /><br />As a voice-over BBC documentary, this material would be exceptional.
Regarded as a work of fiction -- complete with (fictional) authorial
figure -- it has cinematic flaws. Part of the problem is, I think, that
despite its truncation the subject-matter is simply too large. Much of
the rest of the problem, unfortunately, lies in the nature of the
attempted solution!<br /><br />But this should not detract from Downey's astonishing achievement in
the title role, especially in the creation of scenes where we see
archive footage of Chaplin himself. He makes us believe the impossible:
that we are actually privy to the past as it was recorded. It may not
make up a seamless narrative as such, but it is compelling as a glimpse
into the life and work of one of the world's earliest yet most enduring
stars of the screen.
