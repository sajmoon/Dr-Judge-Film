One might expect a cast of wall-to-wall A-listers for a biopic of,
arguably, the most important figure in cinematic history. Indeed, this
film has a number of familiar faces but also a number of less obvious
actors, including a strong British contingent. Principally amongst the
less well-known is the man playing the eponymous Chaplin, Robert Downey
Jr. His is a strong performance, distinguished by his commitment to the
physicality of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s thrilling slapstick whilst, &#x27;off-
camera&#x27;, still and centred. In an unashamedly romantic film as only
David Attenborough can produce, it is a tribute to Downey Jr that he
doesn&#x27;t indulge the melodrama that might otherwise oversaturate the
film.<br /><br />I was also enamoured of a number of the support roles, particularly
Geraldine Chaplin, a fine actress anyway but here, poignantly, playing
her own grandmother. Kevin Kline (Douglas Fairbanks) is also perfect
for Attenborough, full of fun. John Barry&#x27;s score is a strong feature
of the film too, with its epic sweep and hints of wistfulness.
Attenborough also takes some interesting artistic decisions, doing one
scene in the style of silent comedy, which is super, simply
entertaining.<br /><br />I did struggle at times with the conceit of having a fictional editor,
played by Anthony Hopkins, engaging Chaplin in a conversation about his
autobiography. This is designed as an alternative to voice-over or
subtitle to fill in the story, which is reasonable, but means that the
two characters are obliged to tell each other what they already know,
which jarred. Still, this is a wonderful celebration of cinema, which
is what, surely, a review of Chaplin&#x27;s life boils down to. 7/10
