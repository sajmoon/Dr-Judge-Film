The IMDb trivia for Attenborough states regarding his cinematic
thinking states that: &quot;Philosophies include believing in content as
opposed to style and sincerity rather than intelligence.&quot;<br /><br />Sometimes these things work in his films, but the fact is that in art,
sincerity is almost always obtained through intelligence, and honesty
has little to do with truth. Chaplin knew it, so none of his films are
&quot;true&quot; in a strict sense of the word, but all of them are above all
honest. This why, all and all, i don&#39;t quite enjoyed this film: because
it failed to reach the &quot;content&quot; of Chaplin&#39;s work. Attenborough is,
nevertheless, very competent, and so is his camera work, many times
quite interesting (though in these concerns, as well as editing, watch
his bright A bridge too far), and that very aspect makes this partially
worth the time.<br /><br />&quot;-what do we do? -We smile&quot;<br /><br />For me, Chaplin is one of the synonyms for emotion in cinema. Films
become part of people&#39;s lives. Many get into those lives bended by
context, which means, the ones people had the opportunity (good or bad
luck) to watch. Chaplin got into my life quite early and, for a long
time, i never understood exactly what he did, i don&#39;t remember in my
childhood watching a full film of his, but many excerpts are part of my
visual memories (chaplin for children). Growing up and understanding
how all the drama, all the emotion (beyond the &quot;funny&quot;) exists in his
cinema was a true revelation to me and a gate into cinema as an art.
the &quot;clown effect&quot;, the tramp always smiling is always capable of
showing the beautiful and the horrible, the dark and the shiny, dark in
what it shows, shiny in what it comes to provoke. This is humanism in
cinema, in my personal thoughts. From what I know, Chaplin is at the
top of those who (tried to) master this.<br /><br />In the particular film, emotion is left to the end; which is
nevertheless fully made after cinema paradiso. But its strenght is
there because it simply displays Chaplin&#39;s films. The most successful
option here, to my view, would have been to bring out &quot;content&quot; instead
of &quot;facts&quot;. So, back to the citation from IMDb&#39;s trivia, what i find
here is a different notion of &quot;content&quot; (different than my own) which,
for Attenborough, ended up as a collection (that i would call a little
bit dull) of facts, making cinema secondary. In the movie Chaplin says
&quot;if you want to know me, watch my movies&quot;. That would be the key<br /><br />Nevertheless, Downey Jr is very very strong here and his physical
acting is truly remarkable.<br /><br />Meanwhile, as a biographical movie&quot;, my personal choice still goes to
the very recent and relatively unknown &quot;life and death of Peter
Sellers&quot; for it reaches much more into the soul of the artist.<br /><br />My evaluation: 2/5 overall a failure, even though it&#39;s not bad to watch
(mainly due to Downey&#39;s Jr acting and some camera work)<br /><br />http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com
