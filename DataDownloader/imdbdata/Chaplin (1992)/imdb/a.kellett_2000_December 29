<br /><br />Thankyou to Richard Attenborough for this film.  I watched it many a
time
and enjoyed both the biographical aspect and the comedic one but it has
also
increased my interest in silent comics of this great era.<br /><br />The film begins by exploring the early life of Charlie, his Brother Sid
and his Mother as they try to scrape a living.  Thankfully Attenborough
doesn't concentrate too much on this deprived part of Chaplin's life.
However it does reveal interesting facts about Charlie that he never
forgot
during his rise to superstardom.<br /><br />Although Chaplin is played by younger actors at the begining it is the
arrival of Robert Downey Jnr which Chaplin fans will anticipate the most.
He puts in an amazing performance, his London accent is excellent and
ability to do slapstick even better he also really makes you believe that
the great man is alive and on the screen again.<br /><br />The film rightly concentrates on the private life of Chaplin and the
development of the cinema.  Whilst others may want to see the film
concentrate on Chaplin's great pictures e.g The Kid, Gold Rush, and the
Great dictator Attenborough blends the creation of these films into
specific
turning points in Charlie's life.  For example Modern times is used to
show
Chaplin's sympathy towards victims of the wall street crash, as he knew
what
it was like to be extremely poor.  His Jewish connections are also
highlighted by the Great dictator,  which shows his sensitivities to the
European Jews were more at heart than just a making a heap of cash by
having
a laugh at Hitler's moustache and goose stepping troops.<br /><br />The film doesn't get bogged down by Chaplin's hectic love life, as
Dickie
explores Charlie's political beliefs and how J Edgar Hoover was convinced
of
he was a communist party member.  By doing so it shows how Hoover was one
of
the most twisted individuals to hold public office,  with a dangerous
obsession on peoples private lives and background.<br /><br />The film does a good job in showing how important silent stars were and
how we should not forget that they were the true greats when films were
developing all the time from shorts to feature length, from silent to
sound.
