A disappointing flat biopic, given that there is so much interesting
material about Chaplin&#x27;s professional and private life. Richard
Attenborough obviously reveres Chaplin&#x27;s artistry as a performer but
fails miserably to show this in the film. The various stages of his
life are joined by the artificial device of him talking to a publisher
(as he writes his autobiography) and especially why he fails to mention
certain key aspects of his life. It doesn&#x27;t work and the sections of
film seem strangely disjointed and fail to conjoin into a whole. Apart
from a wonderful performance from Robert Downey as Chaplin himself, the
rest is a mess and worst of all the film is plain BORING! I suggest
viewers would be better off either reading a biography of Chaplin&#x27;s
life or better still go back to the source material and watch his
original films ( I recommend City Lights &#x26; The Gold Rush).
