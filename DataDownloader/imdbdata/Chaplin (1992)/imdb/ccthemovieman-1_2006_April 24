Wow, this is one of the finest acting jobs I have seen as Robert Downey
Jr. portrays the famous Charlie Chaplin. His performance includes some
of Chaplin&#39;s famous slapstick moves and Downey is tremendous at
executing them.<br /><br />To the film&#39;s credit ,it does show both the good and bad sides to this
famous man. But it&#39;s definitely biased. Just check out how they portray
J. Edgar Hoover, a man Hollywood loves to hate (along with any
Conservative or Republican). Hoover is pictured as mean-spirited and
nasty throughout, and is even blasted in the ending credits! His first
speech at a dinner table, intended to show him in a negative actually
shows him to be prophetic whether Tinseltown ever admits it or not. <br /><br />Regarding Chaplin, if the film was the truth (that&#39;s always a big
&quot;if&quot;), then it WAS a real miscarriage of justice to kick him out of the
country for having a baby he didn&#39;t produce. Nevertheless, most of the
film centers around his career and his wives, most of whom were very
pretty with great figures.....but too young, most of them being
teenagers!<br /><br />Also shown nicely in the film are Chaplin&#39;s talent, his obsession with
work, his great friendship with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Kevin Kline),
the great films he produced and the sympathy he had with the American
poor. On the other side, in addition to his pedophile instincts, one
wonders why Chaplin never became an American citizen? They certainly
did not help his cause.<br /><br />The movie sports a big-name cast, with Kline probably providing the
most likable role next to Downey. The women were very interesting: from
Geraldine Chaplin playing Charlie&#39;s insane, pathetically-sad mother to
beauties like Milla Jovovich, Diane Lane and Moria Kelly, the latter
playing Chaplin&#39;s final and devoted wife &quot;Oona.&quot; <br /><br />Also in here are some big names: Anthony Hopkins, Dan Ackroyd, Penelope
Ann Miller, Marissa Tomei, James Woods, Nancy Travis and Paul Rhys.
They all help make this a memorable biography. It&#39;s beautifully filmed
with a number of stunning scenes and also has a classy soundtrack. The
ending is manipulative, but it works. It always brings a tear to my
eye.<br /><br />I liked what they did at the end with the small biographies of all the
leading characters and visually showing who played each one. I wish all
films did that.
