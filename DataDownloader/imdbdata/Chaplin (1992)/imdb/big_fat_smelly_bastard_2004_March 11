dickey's two previous directorial efforts ('gandhi' and 'cry freedom'
respectfully) are indeed both excellant movies which asks the prior
question
and why he thought a successful bio pic may have garnered him attention
from
his peers with this load of piffle? i'm sure a much better depiction of
the
silent film star could have been ascertained but the movie fails to peak
and
i'm sure it's star player robert downey jr. has had better luck at drug
rehab. apart from it's handsome production values and a medley of very
good
supporting stalwarts a'la kevin kline (as douglas fairbanks), dan ackroyd,
robert stephens and james woods; it's no wonder this monumentally inept,
gross distortion of the truth and inept enterprise died the death when
first
released in the states.
