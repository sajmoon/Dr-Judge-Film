2001_November 17 

I heard so much about this movie before I saw it that I was really
disappointed when the time came. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 10
instead of a worse note, is Robert Downey's excellent job and - yeah, even
Geraldine Chaplin's portrait of her insane grandmother. But the rest... how
uninspired is everything! Hopkins' fictional character is absolutely
pointless and pretentious, the portraits of Chaplin's women are so
superficial as the historical content (the FBI in a 30years-permanent
paranoic attitude towards the dangerous tramp, huuh...), all the details
picked up from Chaplin's autobiography are or unreflected or badly told (p.
g. the scene where the mother says: &quot;If you only had brought me a cup of
tea&quot; - you DON'T understand this if you haven't read the book, and it loses
all is meaning, 'cause there is a mix of guilt, fear and love in the
feelings of the boy that is almost lost in the scene and the film)... No,
this is not a well-told movie. Apart from the fact that it offers no deeper
relection on what it IS to be a comedian or a genius. Boring. The best part
is, without the shadow of a doubt, the final part where we have the
possibility to see original Chaplin-film-scenes. That, indeed, could be a
merit of this movie: it makes you want to watch the true
Chaplin.
