1999_June 24 

being a huge fan of  Charlie Chaplin i rented this film. its very good and
kept my attention BUT i feel they did not explain enough about the things
that took place and i felt the movie should have been longer. things moved
to quickly. but Robert downey jr was a superb choice for the role of
chaplin
and it is definitely a must-see! 7 1/2 out of 10
