Attenborough's 'Chaplin' is one of the best bio-pics I've ever seen.
He's taken a very tricky screenplay, full of flashbacks and a young
actor who must age a great deal, and made a totally believable film
about Charlie Chaplin. The only possible false note is in the portrayal
of J. Edgar Hoover, played by the excellent Kevin Dunn. This character
is the only one out of a large cast to smack of clich&eacute;, a veritable
Senator McCarthy personification. This isn't a big problem but it would
have been interesting to see Hoover more as a human being than as
simply a rabid reactionary monster.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is tremendous as Chaplin. It is ironic that Downey is
now being hounded by the press and the authorities in much the same way
as was Chaplin in his day. Both being great talents drummed out of work
because of the sharks looking for blood in the press, coupled with an
over-zealousness in law enforcement. Hopefully we haven't seen the last
of Robert Downey Jr because he is truly one of our finest film actors
of the day. <br /><br />The entire cast is wonderful, with Kevin Kline outstanding as Douglas
Fairbanks. Diane Lane also shines as Paulette Goddard.<br /><br />'Chaplin' is indeed one of the most under-rated films of the 1990s.
