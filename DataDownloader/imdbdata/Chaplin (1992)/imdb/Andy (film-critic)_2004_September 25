2004_September 25 

Directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, director of Gandhi, this is the
story of Sir Charles Chaplin. The comic genius who showed the world
what comedy was and introduced American society into the film era. This
film, simply put, was amazing. I was hesitant at first to see how well
Robert Downy, Jr would do as one of the most influential men in movie
history...and he was on target. He showed the brilliance of Chaplin,
and also showed a bit of his dark side. The side that not many knew
about...his underage womanizing, his constant pursuit of perfection
over anything else in the world, and also as the humanitarian. <br /><br />Chaplin did more for film then any other actor during his time, and it
showed. Although my biggest gripe about this film would be the
director, the actors themselves took me away from my seat an into the
life of Charlie Chaplin. This film stared Dan Ankroyd, Anthony Hopkins,
Moria Kelly, Penelope Ann Miller, Marisa Tomei, James Woods, Diane
Lane, Nancy Travis, Kevin Kline, and even a favorite of mine...Milla
Jovovich. The all star cast pushed this movie to excellence. This film
could have been one of the best autobiographical pieces ever made, had
it not been for the director. Now, don't get me wrong...he does good
work...just this one was not his &quot;cup of tea&quot;. I went into this film
expecting a darker ending...a darker story...and a darker character. We
all knew how funny he was, but how dark was his humor...when I went
back and looked at some of his old silent films (before the &quot;talkies&quot;)
I was amazed by how many of them portray his life...the darker aspects
of his life. There are many scenes about his mother and how she was put
into an asylum by Chaplin himself. Hopkins makes the comment, &quot;Your
grandmother was certified insane, and your mother was certified
insane...where did you get your humor?&quot; That line made me think...I
would have liked to see the trauma that was impacted him as a child. <br /><br />Douglas Fairbanks (played wonderfully by Kevin Kline) said to him, &quot;You
know you look like him, Hitler...with the mustache. I think he stole
your bit.&quot; and Chaplin just smiles....was there something there that we
didn't know about...was Chaplin a communist although his brother was a
Jew. These were confusing, and the director did not cover these
grounds. <br /><br />Downey in several of the scenes tells Hopkins (the book reviewer) that
he doesn't want to talk about it...and they don't .... I wanted them to
go deeper into his psyche and see where all of it came from. Most of
these points were just passing glance...which irritated me. Watch the
ending, the director tries to wrap up Chaplin's life at the Academy
Awards, and that was when it hit me about how much darker I wanted this
to be...I don't know, I guess I am the generation of JFK and Nixon or
Oliver Stone at his best...but I needed darker. <br /><br />I know it was there.....I just know it!!!! <br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****
