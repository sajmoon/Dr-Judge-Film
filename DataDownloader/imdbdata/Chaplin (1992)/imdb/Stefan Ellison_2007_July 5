Charles Chaplin was one of cinema&#39;s first geniuses. Responsible for
such immortal classics like Modern Times and City Lights, his life was
brought to the screen in this highly enjoyable film from Academy Award
winning director Sir Richard Attenborough. Adapted from Chaplin&#39;s own
autobiography and David Robinson&#39;s fascinating documentation on the
great comedian (well worth a read), the film portrays his life from
living in poverty on the slums of London to becoming a hot bed of
controversy during the McCarthy era of the 1950&#39;s. All of his story is
told through flashbacks, with a fictional editor discussing his
autobiography that he wrote in the early 1960&#39;s, almost ten years after
his re-entry visa into the United States was canceled.<br /><br />In between, we are introduced how Charlie Chaplin got into show
business, with his older half brother Sydney showing his talents to
Fred Karno. His drunk act is a huge success with audiences in England
and he also falls in love for the first time with Hetty Kelly, a
showgirl in Karno&#39;s troop. After she refuses his marriage proposal, he
goes to a strange world called America where Mack Sennett from Keystone
Studios hires him to be in a brand new, magical technology known as
&quot;film.&quot; It is then that Charlie creates his immortal character and one
that will live on for generations: The Little Tramp. He then moves on
to direct his own films and marries an underage girl named Mildrid
Harris, who soon divorces him, even so far as wanting The Kid. He
continues to marry more teenagers as well as the twenty-two year old
Paulette Goddard, who remarks that she&#39;s much to old for him. He also
decides to poke fun at the world&#39;s biggest monster, Adolf Hitler in The
Great Dictator, despite his Jewish brother&#39;s protests against the idea.
Meanwhile, Chaplin&#39;s greatest enemy J Edgar Hoover constantly thwarts
to rid America of the famed British comedian.<br /><br />Read the above the description of Chaplin and notice that only two
films of the real Chaplin are mentioned. There lies the main problem
with this biopic. It concentrates so much screen times on his marriages
and controversies, that it forgets what made Chaplin so great and a
saviour in people&#39;s eyes: his films. Chaplin barely shows Charlie
actually making his beloved classics with him being shown directing
only four of his pictures. Those scenes don&#39;t even last for a long time
with other films being mentioned quite briefly. However, Attenborough
feels necessary to use up a lot of screen time on his relationships
(the Joan Barry storyline lasts for too long) and Anthony Hopkins&#39;s
role as his autobiography editor is unneeded. However, as a Chaplin
fan, I feel unable to not recommend this film because it actually is
very entertaining with the highlight certainly being the
Oscar-nominated performance by Robert Downey Jr. He captures every
nuance and movement of Charles Spencer Chaplin perfectly that his
portrayal of the Little Tramp doesn&#39;t feel like an imitation. Geraldine
Chaplin also manages a splendid job playing her own grandmother. She
appears in few scenes, but still leaves an impression throughout the
film.<br /><br />Moira Kelly also delivers in two roles as both Chaplin&#39;s first love
Hetty Kelly and as his last love Oona O&#39;Neal as well as Kevin Kline
playing his long time friend and United Artists co-founder Douglas
Fairbanks. The technical aspects of the production also prove immensely
well with the makeup, costumes, sets and John Barry&#39;s score all being
top-notch. The screenplay, which was written by three very accomplished
writers, give the characters some natural lines that their real life
personas certainly would have said. Chaplin may not show exactly what
made Chaplin such a genius, but Downey Jr&#39;s performance as well as the
rest of the accomplished cast make this a great film to watch after
gobbling up those great silent and sound comedies that only a genius
like Charles Chaplin could create.
