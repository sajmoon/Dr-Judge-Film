I am a huge fan of Charlie Chaplin and became fascinated with his life
when I took a film class. I also wrote a paper about him requiring a
lot of research obviously, this man had a tragic childhood but is the
American Dream of coming to America having virtually no money and
becoming the first world famous actor. Robert Downey, Jr. did a good
job of portraying the Tramp and was doing a great job of the acts and
drama. He did a good job of portraying him and made me laugh more than
a couple times. The cast in general did a great job.<br /><br />But I felt the story just wasn&#39;t too right or done as well as it could
have been. I felt that they made Charlie into being too sympathetic,
while the man was a genius, he was very selfish in real life and quite
the perfectionist which made him a very angry person. But I felt that
over all, it&#39;s a good adaption, just not if you want to know the true
life of Charlie Chaplin.<br /><br />7/10
