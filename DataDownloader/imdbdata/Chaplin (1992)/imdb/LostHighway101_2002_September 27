Forget what you may have heard about 1992&#x27;s &#x22;Chaplin&#x22; being a tabloid
approach to the life of Charles Spencer Chaplin&#x27;s. It does not focus on
Chaplin&#x27;s body of work as much as his turbulent personal and love life,
which seems to turn most viewers off. Fortunately, its lead extracts
nothing but magic from the material.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. gives an Acadamy Award-nominated performance with
spot-on physical pantomime. He gracefully handles the difficult task of
recreating Chaplin&#x27;s physical art from his adolescence through his
elderly exile in Switzerland. He plays him as a tortured bad boy and
somehow makes the audience (like the film&#x27;s director) turn a blind eye
to the more scandalous aspects of Chaplin.<br /><br />Downey skillfully navigates director Richard Attenborough&#x27;s loving yet
ambivalent handling of Chaplin&#x27;s scandals. Attenborough was lucky
enough to have also a brilliant score by John Barry and a brawny
supporting cast, because the script is undeniably overwrought and
unfocused. Downey Jr. makes a shallow handling of the Chaplin story
into a highly-watchable experience. With a better script this could
have been gold.
