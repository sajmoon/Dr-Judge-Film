1999_August 23 

Robert Downey, Jr. gives another one of his splendid performances, Kevin
Kline is perfectly cast as Fairbanks, and most of the direction is superb.
However, the story hops around a few too many times, and the scenes with
Anthony Hopkins are weak and obviously placed in order to clarify things
to
non- Chaplin fans who watch the film. Overall it is enjoyable, especially
the parts when we see him creating his well- known masterpieces.
Recommended
especially for movie fans, and most especially for Chaplin
fans.
