Something to see every 15 years or so, when the details have faded. A
wonderful ensemble cast and bravura performance by Downey. Kevin Kline
is also unforgettable. <br /><br />Others have chronicled the film&#39;s storyline and characters; what I had
forgotten was how sad the picture is. It&#39;s a classic &quot;laugh, clown,
laugh&quot; type of story but never maudlin or over the top.<br /><br />One aspect I would have liked to have seen explored more is Chaplin&#39;s
musicianship as well as his arc from Cockney accent to upper-class
English. We mercifully don&#39;t really see Downey playing violin (nothing
is worse than watching non-musicians pretend to be musicians or
conductors) but the film implies Chaplin more or less writes the scores
to his pictures. There&#39;s one off-hand remark about his accent but it&#39;s
not explored. A touch more would have been nice to see in both these
areas.<br /><br />Having said all that, the film doesn&#39;t compel me to watch it repeatedly
to explore the subtleties. It&#39;s a lovely, poignant picture that does
fine in a single viewing.
