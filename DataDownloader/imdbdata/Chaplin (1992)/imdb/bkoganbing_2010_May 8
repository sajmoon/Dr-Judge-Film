In a career beset by a whole lot of personal problems, Robert Downey,
Jr. reached his career high with his Oscar nominated biographical
portrayal of Charlie Chaplin. In areas that are not equally covered,
Chaplin is given a thorough portrayal as we glimpse his art, his
politics and what was a stormy personal life.<br /><br />Born into incredible poverty in one of the poorest sections of London,
Charlie grew out of the poverty as did so many others through the
medium of entertainment. He perfected a whole slew of characters while
in vaudeville here and the Music Hall in Great Britain and made a
fateful decision to try that new medium of motion pictures. When he
invented his Little Tramp character the world was his.<br /><br />Chaplin was a multi-faceted show business entity. He was a genius both
in front and behind the camera, knowing his tramp character better than
anyone. He also was a wonderful composer such standards as Smile and
This Is My Song are his, both music and lyrics. And in founding United
Artist Motion Pictures with fellow mega silent superstars Douglas
Fairbanks and Mary Pickford he became a movie mogul as well, one of the
first film stars to get into the production end where the big money
was.<br /><br />His left wing politics made many fear him as his mastery of the
communication aspect of film led some to believe he would use it for
subversive ends. I have no doubt that J. Edgar Hoover thought that, but
Hoover thought that about many. Contrary to the film&#x27;s plot, Hoover was
not Chaplin&#x27;s number one enemy.<br /><br />In fact Hoover gets barely a mention in Chaplin&#x27;s autobiography. The
one who really had it in for him was gossip columnist Hedda Hopper who
was the self appointed keeper of Hollywood morals. Hedda&#x27;s politics
were right wing Republican. It was she to whom Joan Barry played here
by Nancy Travis came and it was Hedda Hopper who kept the lurid details
of the Barry pregnancy in the headlines with the result of Chaplin
being arrested for rape. Eventually it was Hopper who had a lot more to
do with Charlie Chaplin being deported than Hoover ever did. Yet Hopper
is not even a character here. <br /><br />Don&#x27;t read Chaplin&#x27;s memoirs, read her&#x27;s. To her dying day Hedda Hopper
made reading Chaplin out of the film community her crusade just as her
fellow gossip columnist Louella Parsons had Orson Welles as her target.
Both Chaplin and Welles have better reputations today than the women
who journalisticly tormented them.<br /><br />Director Richard Attenborough did not let Downey&#x27;s performance
overwhelm the rest of the cast. Pay note to people like Dan Aykroyd as
Mack Sennett, Diane Lane as Paulette Goddard, and Geraldine Chaplin
playing her own grandmother, Charlie&#x27;s mother. And special mention must
go to Kevin Kline playing Douglas Fairbanks. Kline plays the aging
swashbuckling superstar as a middle aged man with a variety of health
problems who was Chaplin&#x27;s one really true friend.<br /><br />Downey lost to Al Pacino who was finally given an overdue Oscar for
Scent Of A Woman. Chaplin also received nominations for Best Art&#x26;Set
Direction and Best Musical Score.<br /><br />Still Chaplin remains Downey&#x27;s personal best and if not a totally
accurate film about the Little Tramp, one I&#x27;m sure he would have
approved.
