I don&#x27;t know why fictional biographies turn out so badly. Bruce Lee,
Mozart and the Doors movies were also awful when it came to fictional
biographies. It turns out that one would have gained a lot more true
knowledge from just watching a solid documentary about these people.
The problem with the Chaplin movie is that it is too sentimental and
weak. Obviously the real Chaplin was no where near the way he is
portrayed in this film. In the best case, this movie is some kind of
fairy-tale build on the life of a real character. I would recommend a
more truthful rendition of history such as the one employed in Tom
Cruise&#x27;s new movie about the assassination of Hitler: Operation
Valkyrie. Chaplin shows no loyalty whatsoever to the person or his
movies. Nor does it have any psychological or historical understanding.
If one wants to watch a weak Disney-like rendition of a very
interesting person and legend in movie science then watch this
extremely stupid, weak and boring movie.
