Charlie Chaplin is easily recognised as a screen legend, making silent
films that known now as comedy classics. But there is more to him then
just filmmaking as shown in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s bio-pic.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. stars as Chaplin, from his easy days living in
poverty in London with his mentally ill mother (Geraldine Chaplin) and
homing his comedy skills in Victorian and Edwardian music halls before
earning his big break in America. He becomes a stars, acting and
directing hit films, owning his own studio before he is thirty. But
there is his trouble for the actor involving his numerous marriages
with younger women and the director of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover (Kevin
Dunn) wants to prove that Chaplin was a Communist just for harbouring
support for the working man and being against the Nazis.<br /><br />Downey&#x27;s performance was the strongest element of the film and he
deserved an Oscar nod for it. Downey was able to display he could do
both the comic slapstick with comical observations mixed with the
serious drama of the film. He shows that there was tragedy in Chaplin&#x27;s
life and that like with most comedians there is a troubled background.
He is a man who cares but is faulted as well, willing be selfish. And
he is political, from his views against Nazism to his opinion that
America needs to be open. And Downey does give an excellent English
accent, making should he added authenticity to his role.<br /><br />Attenborough made sure there was a balance between the comic and the
drama, though I personally preferred the more dramatic elements of the
film. He uses screen wipes to give the film a feel of a silent movie
and made should despite the 2 hours, 18 minute running time the film
does have a fast pace to it. A problem is that some elements of the
film does feel like they were rushed and skipped over and the scene in
Utah which was done like a Chaplin silent film did not work for me in
the context of the film. A scene thought that was really well handled
was the ending (this is a SPOILER so look away now if you don&#x27;t want to
know) when Chaplin receives a life time achievement Oscar when they
show clips of Chaplin&#x27;s old films and Chaplin slowly starts to cry some
tears: it was a scene that did not need words.<br /><br />Thematically the basic idea of the film is that it shows someone can
fulfil the America dream, from poverty in London a man with talent can
success in Hollywood if he just has the ambition and intelligence to
do. He was a man who become a millionaire but still had sympathy for
the have nots in society. There is the theme of Chaplin&#x27;s wondering eye
for younger ladies and his inability to keep a relationship going. The
other idea of the film is America&#x27;s distrust of anyone being critical
of their society and system, that anyone who dares to criticise is
tagged as a Communist or hates America, a problem that is still
affecting the nation. It shows that under the era of Hoover and
McCarthyism that people were hounded just because of their believes.
