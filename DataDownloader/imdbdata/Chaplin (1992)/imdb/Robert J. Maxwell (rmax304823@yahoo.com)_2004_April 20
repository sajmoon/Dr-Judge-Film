Attenborough is a craftsman who produces popular works on Big Subjects.  The
canvases are, as they say, vast.  Stupendous!  Collosal!  A Cast of
Thousands!  <br /><br />This is a pretty good picture about a complicated great man, about his
successes, his pecadillos, the injustices that were done to him by people
far more crazed than he was.  There is nothing remarkable about the film. 
As art, it's more historical than anything else.  As biography, it has some
gaps in it so that, at times, it's a little hard to follow the sequence of
events.  Of course a film can be only so long, but we want to know more
about some of the characters and their motives.  Was his affair with
Paulette Goddard really so ephemeral?  Why wasn't it brought out that Oona
O'Neill was the daughter of Nobelist playwright Eugene?  And who the hell
was the Nancy Travis character and why is she in this movie at all -- only
to get pregnant?  Perhaps the best scene is at the end, when Downey is
wheeled onto the balcony of a darkened Academy Awards meeting and everyone
is watching clips of his films and laughing.  We can hardly see Downey's
face (the age makeup is fine) but his eyes glisten in the light from the
screen and he is silently tearing up.  Attenborough had the good sense to
close on the darkened auditorium.<br /><br />All the elements of the standard biography are here.  The best friend who
dies young.  The complicated love life.  The vengeful nuts.  Through it all,
Charlie remains sober and thoughtful.  In an ordinary biopic the hero
descends into alcoholism or some other vice.  But Downey is pretty straight,
an honorable and sensitive man from beginning to end.  The only vice he
displays is a taste for rather young women.  Some vice!  This is Hollywood,
Mister!  A chaque a son gout.  As if powerful men and pretty girls didn't
trade favors.  Ask any rock star.  Besides, the sight of the
sixteen-year-old Mila Jovovich slowly applying lipstick would tempt St.
Anthony.<br /><br />It's not very gripping.  Most of the characters come and go so quickly that
it's hard to grasp them as individuals.  We do get some ideas of the reasons
for Chaplin's sympathy for the little people.  (It was the same as
Dickens'.)  And, although we're on Chaplin's side throughout, the movie
winds up more instructive than emotionally involving.  It would fit rather
nicely into a class on film history.<br /><br />Worth seeing, but probably not more than once.  <br /><br />
