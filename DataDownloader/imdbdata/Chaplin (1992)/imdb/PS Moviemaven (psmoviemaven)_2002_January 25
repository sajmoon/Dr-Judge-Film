Probably one of Robert Downey Jr's best roles. He clearly became Charlie
Chaplin, a filmmaking icon. This film takes through all the phases of
Charlie Chaplins life, from his youth in the U.K. to his highly successful
film career during the birth of the film industry in the USA. This film
and
Downey's portrail allow us to see Charlie's life, work, and loves. The
real
Charlie Chaplin had enough tradegies and loss to successfully create &quot;The
Little Tramp&quot;, who is at once hilarious and filled with pathos.
