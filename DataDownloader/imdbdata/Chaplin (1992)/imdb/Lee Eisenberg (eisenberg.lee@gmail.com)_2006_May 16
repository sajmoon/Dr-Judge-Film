I would have given &quot;Chaplin&quot; 10/10 had it not jumped around so much and
over-emphasized the scandals in Charlie Chaplin&#39;s life (that subtracted
from the emphasis on his artistic talent). But otherwise, it did a
great job showing his life and how the US government basically forced
him out of the country after WWII (they tried to call him a communist).<br /><br />I remember that I saw this right after I saw &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and it
was eye-opening when I realized that this movie&#39;s director was the same
man who played John Hammond. Seeing Robert Downey Jr. do so well in the
title role here, it&#39;s weird to think that he got in so much trouble
with the law in later years. Also starring Geraldine Chaplin (as her
own mentally ill grandmother), Paul Rhys, Moira Kelly, Anthony Hopkins,
Dan Aykroyd, Marisa Tomei, Penelope Ann Miller, Kevin Kline, Maria
Pitillo, Milla Jovovich, Kevin Dunn, Diane Lane and James Woods. Pretty
well done, but not the best biopic ever.
