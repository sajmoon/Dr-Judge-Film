I don't know when this will be available to be read on IMDB, but I'm sending
it just one day after what would be Charlie Chaplin's 119th
Birthday.<br /><br />I saw this film when it first came out, knowing of Charlie by pure osmosis
and having never seen one of his films.  Not too long afterward, I wound up
on a binge of wanting to know everything about him (I read his
autobiography, along with the book by his second wife that he only dedicated
a few lines to, and one by his son Michael, who also had a major role in &quot;A
King in New York&quot;)<br /><br />Okay, so the film does run slow, but it's not supposed to be an action film,
it's a biography.  It's not going to be like &quot;The Doors&quot; because he wasn't
that kind of a &quot;wild man&quot;.  Anyone who complains about it being too much
about his personal life should get a dictionary and find out what a
biography is, because, as anyone at least should know, one cannot find too
much about a person just by watching his movies.  That would be like telling
VH1 to just play videos of the artists' songs on a &quot;Behind the Music&quot; or
&quot;Legends&quot; documentary and leave out who the artists are/were and where they
came from, etc.<br /><br />Although it does leave out more than just a few details, like his hanging
around with the Hearsts a lot, and that the &quot;Stan&quot; who gives him the
telegram in Butte, MT was supposed to be Stan Laurel, who would later become
famous for his films with Oliver Hardy (Yes, THAT Laurel and Hardy), it does
give an overall picture of who Charlie was and what was behind all the films
Charlie Chaplin made.  <br /><br />I don't know if it's a quote from the actual Charlie himself when he says,
&quot;You want to understand me?  Watch my movies&quot;  but this movie does give
insight to that statement, as you can see that through &quot;The Little Tramp&quot;
and other characters he played once he went to sound, he did express his
beliefs, his personality, his background story, things he'd wished he'd
said, things he wished he could do, wished had been done, would have done if
he'd had the power, etc.<br /><br />A perfect example of this shown at the end of the film, especially when
clips of the end of &quot;The Kid&quot; (featuring the original Uncle Fester when he
was just a tyke) are shown; as you have already seen from the beginning of
the film of the events of Charlie's childhood, you can see all the heart and
emotion that was poured out into that film.<br /><br />There was only so much of his life that could be squashed into just over two
hours, but remember, it's not as though there are many studios who would say
yes to a biography film that would be much longer.  It was 1992 when this
film was released and VH1 was not showing any movies let alone a 5-hour
bio-film of the Jacksons.  What other channel would do any of the same at
the time?  Especially when TV channels have to worry about ratings?  How
many people would actually tune into this bio, whether it was a mini-series
or whatever?<br /><br />Anyway, had it not been for this movie, I probably would have only known OF
Charlie Chaplin, and never would have taken the opportunity to see any of
his films.  I'm sure there are many others who were pleasantly introduced to
Chaplin this way.<br /><br />It is for that reason, I salute this movie.<br /><br />
