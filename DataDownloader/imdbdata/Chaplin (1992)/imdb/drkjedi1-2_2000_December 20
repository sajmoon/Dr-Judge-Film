2000_December 20 

One of my all time favorites. I saw this movie at least 3 times in the
theater and watch it regularly on video/dvd. Beautifully directed and
acted.
I wish Robert Downey Jr. had gotten the oscar for his perfomance for this
film, he was perfect. Even Chaplin's own daughter, Geraldine who starred
as
her own grandmother was shocked when she first saw Robert and said in
interviews it was like seeing her father come walking towards her! I will
never tire of this film, it is truly one of the greatest films
made.
