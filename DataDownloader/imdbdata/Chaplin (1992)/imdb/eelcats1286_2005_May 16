I randomly pulled this movie off the library shelf and have been in
love with it every since. It is the directing and the wonderful acting
that make this film such a treat. At the forefront is Robert Downey Jr.
with an amazing performance as Charlie Chaplin. He not only looked the
part but he had the physicality and the talent to bring to life one of
film's enigmas. His ability to evoke tenderness, anger, and laughter is
as great as Chaplin's himself. The supporting cast is excellent with no
one person standing out farther than another which is what was needed.
This is an excellent biopic and if it is not strictly factual, oh well,
Hollywood never is. What is important is that we are entertained by
this movie, that's Charlie Chaplin would have wanted and that's what we
get. 10/10
