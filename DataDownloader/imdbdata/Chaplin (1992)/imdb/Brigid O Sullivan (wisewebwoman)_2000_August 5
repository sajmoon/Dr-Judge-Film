Some day, I hope Chaplin will be served up in a biopic with all his
warts and genius intact.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. does a remarkable job with both the script and
direction&#39;s shortcomings and visually he is stunning as Charlie.<br /><br />One of the greatest flaws with the script is the manner in which
Charlie&#39;s predeliction for very young girls is even justified as a
yearning for the one that got away when he was leaving for the US at
the start of his career. Puh-leese.<br /><br />Nowhere in this film does it depict his genius for creating his
powerful movies in all its intensity and endless rehearsals. His hard
work at development of his on screen persona is also given short shrift
here and his reason for abandoning all ties with the cinema and his
music ( he was a brilliant composer, also) is never made clear.<br /><br />Why did he not pursue this in Europe or England. How did he fill in the
last 35 years of his life in Switzerland ? A highly unsatisfying vision
of the great Charlie Chaplin.<br /><br />One of Richard Attenborough&#39;s few bombs.
