This movie looked pretty good when I first looked it up, great cast, great
director, and when I saw it, for the most part I wasnt dissapointed. 
Director Richard Attenborough(Gandhi, Cry Freedom) did a great job at
creating the atmosphere of the time period, the music, the scenery, were all
great.  In most of his movies, Richard Attenborough casts many familiar
faces, in this one he casts almost all of the main stars of his previous
movies, Kevin Kline(Cry Freedom), Anthony Hopkins(Magic, A Bridge Too Far)
to name a couple, for some reason Ben Kingsley is missing.  Robert Downey
does a great job as Chaplin, as well as the supporting cast in their roles. 
The one problem is that Attenborough had a difficult time keeping focus with
all of the different things going on at once, this may turn off many
viewers.  Using Anthony Hopkins as Chaplin's companion as an old man was a
very nice touch.  Overall not a bad biography, 6.5 out of
10.
