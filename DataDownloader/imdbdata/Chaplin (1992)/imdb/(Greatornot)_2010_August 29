This film did an excellent job of portraying Charlie Chaplin. Other
than overdramatizing younger lovers, The film , I felt was accurate.
Back in the early part of the century, ages of consent were much lower.
The film made it seem like Chaplin was a pedophile, but clearly it was
a different world during a different time. Robert Downey Jr. as usual
was immersed in his role. I do not believe any actor could have done a
better job. I certainly understand him winning an Oscar for this
portrayal. The rest of the actors were excellent as well. This film had
fantastic direction and I would not expect anything different from
Richard Attenborough. You know it is an excellent film when you feel
you are a part of that time period and locations. Comedy and drama were
complimented very nicely in this film. As an historical , educational
project, I felt I was enlightened very much so about this time period.
That said, I think the film also did a wonderful job of interlacing
events such as WWI, Hitler and the Depression without going overboard.
Basically, relating these historic events to the bio of Chaplin. This
is definitely a must see film for any film buff.
