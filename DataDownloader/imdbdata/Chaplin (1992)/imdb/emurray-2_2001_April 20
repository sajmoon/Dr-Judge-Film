Charlie Chaplin has a difficult life.  Robert Downey, Jr. was fabulous in
portraying his life story.  The multitude of facial expressions Robert
Downey, Jr. is able to present on film is indeed remarkable.  Few others
could have equalled and almost no one could have surpassed his inate ability
to depict this multifaceted, multitalented human being.  Chaplin was one of
a kind.  Robert Downey, Jr. is terrific.  Personally, I encourage you to
enjoy the movie, 'Chaplin.'
