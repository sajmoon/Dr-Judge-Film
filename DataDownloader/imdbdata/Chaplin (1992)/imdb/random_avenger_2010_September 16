Biography films are often rather formulaic and predictable in their
attempts of recounting the subject&#x27;s life and works from the cradle to
the grave. While Richard Attenborough&#x27;s Charlie Chaplin biopic doesn&#x27;t
deviate from the traditional structure of the genre, it is a well made
and fairly gripping tale of one of the greatest comedians of the 20th
century.<br /><br />The present day of the storyline is set in the 1960s when the elderly
Chaplin (Robert Downey Jr.) is writing his autobiography and discussing
the details with his editor (Anthony Hopkins). The important moments of
his eventful life are then seen in flashbacks in chronological order:
childhood in poverty with a mentally ill mother (Geraldine Chaplin),
the emerge of young Charlie&#x27;s natural gift for entertaining, his
introduction to stage acting and eventually films, move to America,
many relationships with young women (played by Moira Kelly, Penelope
Ann Miller and Milla Jovovich to name a few), problems with
workaholism, accusations of Communist sympathies...<br /><br />Despite the unsurprising approach to the character, the story always
stays interesting, as the real-life Chaplin was a fascinating
character. To fans of his work the most enjoyable details may be the
references to actual Chaplin films and the birth stories of his most
famous characters, namely the Little Tramp and Adenoid Hynkel. One
comedic scene is even played partly sped up, re-enacting the now-iconic
&#x22;jerky&#x22; feel of old cinema caused by incorrect playing speeds of film
reels in the post-silent era. Of course, the brief clips of Chaplin&#x27;s
films (The Gold Rush, The Circus, Modern Times...) are funny per se
too. Cinema history buffs may also enjoy the portrayal of the budding
film industry and the general spirit of modernity that prevailed in the
early 20th century until the end of the silent era.<br /><br />One of the strong points of the film is definitely the acting. Robert
Downey Jr.&#x27;s performance in the title role is the driving force behind
the whole film and he suits the part formidably, always carrying a
sense of melancholy under the cheery surface. Chaplin&#x27;s many wives and
other women of his life are all very beautiful and a joy to watch, but
several other supporting actors deserve a mention too, particularly Dan
Aykroyd as Chaplin&#x27;s first film director Mack Sennett, Kevin Kline as
the energetic star actor Douglas Fairbanks and Kevin Dunn as J. Edgar
Hoover who gains a place as one of the antagonists in the story with
his mudslinging campaign against Chaplin.<br /><br />The music by John Barry and Jos&#xE9; Padilla feels a bit uneven, sometimes
diving into awkwardly obvious sentimentalism but at other times
beautifully invigorating the moods the images create. The ending of the
film itself, Chaplin receiving an honorary award at the Academy Awards
gala with a montage of his greatest scenes playing on the big screen
behind him, could easily come across as irritating tearjerking, but I
think the scene is justified by what we have seen in the preceding film
and has its place at the grandiose end of the tale. On the other hand,
one of the most stylishly sparse scenes is seen right at the beginning
during the opening credits when Chaplin slowly removes his tramp makeup
while the image slowly changes from black and white to colour.<br /><br />It is true that the movie suffers from the usual problems often found
in biography films, such as the plot not being very tight and the
ending being something of a foregone conclusion; perhaps focusing on a
shorter period of time could have helped to cast more light on, say,
the importance of the numerous women in his life, as now the marriages
and the births of his children are acknowledged quite hastily.
Nevertheless, thanks to the powerful performances and the fascinating
subject matter, the film is ultimately an enjoyable effort recommended
to anyone interested in the man who became a legend even in his
lifetime.
