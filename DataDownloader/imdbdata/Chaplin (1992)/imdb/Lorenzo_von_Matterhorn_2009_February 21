Even if you&#39;re not a Charlie Chaplin fan like me, this movie is still a
must-see for all avid movie goers out there. Directed by Lord Richard
Attenborough, also the creator of another biopic-&quot;Gandhi&quot;, Chaplin is a
wonderful portrayal of an incredible icon, the highs and the lows, the
triumphs and the failures. We take a special look into the life of one
of Hollywood&#39;s most celebrated cultural pop icons and quite possibly
one of the greatest comics of all time. While not really a masterpiece
in any way as the film tends to jump around a bit from scene to scene,
however, under the watchful eye of Attenborough, the film packs a neat
punch and leaves a lasting impression to the audience. The technicals
are also worth noting, from Sven Nykvist&#39;s mesmerizing Oscar nominated
cinematography and John Barry&#39;s haunting and enchanting music score
which was put to great effect in one of the film&#39;s highlights: the
opening scene.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. gives the performance of a lifetime as Chaplin, his
best performance to date I might add. He captured the essence of
Chaplin down to the gait, accent and gestures. He completely
disappeared into the role no matter what stage of life the character
was in, from the young would-be entertainer from vaudeville, to the
dashing and charming early 30&#39;s in Hollywood and old, fragile man in
exile - he easily complimented Chaplin&#39;s quirkiness and joyous persona
and all the while still creating a real human being on screen. Not only
RDJ&#39;s best performance but also one of the most impressive performance
of the 90&#39;s. An energetic Kevin Kline as Doug Fairbanks was a stand out
among the supporting cast and the performances from the rest of the
cast were very good indeed.<br /><br />The ending where Chaplin is being awarded with a lifetime achievement
Oscar is hauntingly beautiful topped off with Downey&#39;s award winning
tears and John Barry&#39;s alluring music, a great ending for a great film.
