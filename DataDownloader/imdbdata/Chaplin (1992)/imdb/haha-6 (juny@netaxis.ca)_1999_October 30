The movie is nice as a biography of the famous comedian
Chaplin.
The first half of this movie runs in a right direction to introduce
Chaplin's life and his debut to American stages but it falls more and more
into the Chaplin's private relations with women and his political scandal
rather than presents more story about Chaplin's great work and its success
in theaters but it's not disappointing. It's basically a good movie.
Specially the end is quite fascinating.
