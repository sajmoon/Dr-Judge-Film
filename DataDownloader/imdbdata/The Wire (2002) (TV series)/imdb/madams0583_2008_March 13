The Wire is an outstanding show that surpasses all others in its genre.
Written well, acted well, and directed well, The Wire sucks you in to
the lives of all the characters, no matter how crooked the character.
To not get its proper reward for being (imho) the best show on TV, is
ludicrous. It is the only show that I can watch every episode of every
season and keep wanting more. I never get bored with it. Sure it might
take watching a couple episodes to get &quot;into it&quot;, but the story is so
compelling and layered that you are always on the edge of your seat,
because literally anything could happen. I wish it got the respect that
it deserves. I have read only good reviews of the show, even that it is
some critics favorite show, but where are the awards? I am talking
about the big ones, Golden Globes/Emmy&#39;s? I can&#39;t stand seeing shows
like Grey&#39;s Anatomy, House and other melo-dramatic/superficial shows
winning. And what do those shows do for society? NOTHING! The Wire is
showing a REAL world to people. Things that are happening on our
streets right now. The Wire is a rare breed, that blows the competition
out of the water!
