The Wire is the most intelligent, intricate, moving, and plain
brilliant TV show I have ever had the pleasure to experience.<br /><br />It&#39;s intricacy lies in the number of different perspectives we get in
the city of Baltiimore. It shows the war against crime from both the
sides of the cops, and from the criminals who they are trying to
apprehend. Furthermore, politics and the media become involved as this
mesmerising drama develops throughout the seasons. This broad
perspective gives one the feeling that they know the workings of a city
and its police department in startling detail.<br /><br />The writing is a step ahead of anything that preceded it. It is written
as a cinematic novel. Each season being a novel, with each episode
therein being a chapter. No plot line is left unfinished as the wire
expertly navigates its way through the 5 seasons.<br /><br />It has an immensely huge character base, each character with so many
multi-coloured layers that you cannot help but totally immerse yourself
in the world of the Wire.<br /><br />I cannot be copious enough in my praise for this show.
