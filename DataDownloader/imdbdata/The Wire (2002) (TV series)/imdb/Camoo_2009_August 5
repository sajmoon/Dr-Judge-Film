Blows my mind that I hadn&#x27;t come across this series before.. Recently
sat through a marathon 65 hours of the Wire on DVD and while watching
it became aware that this was something completely apart from just
about anything ever produced, television, film, anything. The series is
set up with a gritty naturalism that harks to a more film-like
language, but it relentlessly tracks these characters in ways that only
a 65-hour series devoted to these lives could do. I&#x27;ve never sat
through a 65 hour long film before. <br /><br />I&#x27;m so glad somebody has finally given a voice to this part of America.
It&#x27;s about time. <br /><br />Absolutely excellent.
