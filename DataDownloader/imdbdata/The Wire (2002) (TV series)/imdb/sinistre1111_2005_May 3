Season 3 of The Wire ended like a great novel, in a series of great
novels, about crime, politics, &quot;po-lice&quot; and personalities in the City
of Baltimore. The Wire truly has no equivalent on American TV, more
akin to something like the British miniseries Traffik, or Robert
Altman's Short Cuts, but really in a class by itself. The show also
doesn't fetch the ratings of HBO's other blockbuster series, like The
Sopranos or Deadwood, but so far the network has stood behind what is
indisputably a creative / artistic success. Viewers accustomed to
having a Tony Soprano or an Al Swearingen to latch onto may be daunted
by The Wire's 2-dozen or so &quot;main&quot; characters, all given equal
importance within multiple story lines. The concurrent tales all buoy
one another, and as the season draws to a close, they begin to merge
and compliment each other in unexpected ways. No detail is too small to
not be done with great care, and no significant threads are left to
hang, which also speaks to the brilliance of the writers.<br /><br />The Wire is no less than a dramatic triumph, and I can't wait for a new
season.
