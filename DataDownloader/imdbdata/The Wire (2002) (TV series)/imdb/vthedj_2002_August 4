this show is fantastic. very realistic regarding the behavior and mentality
of low level drug dealers and the cops. i agree with one of the first
commentators who referred to the show as &quot;addictive&quot;. it is definitely
that.
i think the actor that portrays &quot;omar&quot; is excellent. his character is not
listed on this web site for some reason. if anyone out there knows what the
actor's name his, can you please post it. thanks in advance.<br /><br />
