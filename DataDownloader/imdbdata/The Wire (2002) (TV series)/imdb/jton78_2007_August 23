Really, this viewpoint from a person who does not live in Baltimore can
honestly say that it is a great city. We have surpassed 200 murders for
the year and it is only August!!! Witnesses are getting killed all of
the time and you should know that there are a lot of drugs there too.
Yeah, I think the show is definitely an accurate depiction of Baltimore
with all of the corruption, rotten public officials that don&#39;t care
about helping the people but furthering careers, drugs, violence, etc.
But that is everywhere, right.<br /><br />Great show that really brings the cities problems to the light of the
public. You should watch it, over and over again.
