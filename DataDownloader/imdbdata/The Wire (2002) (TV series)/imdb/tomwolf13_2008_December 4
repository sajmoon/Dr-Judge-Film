The day &#39;The Wire&#39; ended was a sad day to me. Having to see some of my
favourite characters in any medium (novels, TV, movies, etc.) for the
last time felt like saying goodbye to my friends. Knowing that I will
never be so involved in a series ever again is saddening. At the same
time, however, I&#39;m proud that &#39;The Wire&#39; was taken off the air before
it could have been potentially bastardized like many series before it.<br /><br />This show is a pinnacle in entertainment, and though never acclaimed
with awards as it should have been, will go down as perhaps the
greatest television series in history...and perhaps the greatest thing
ever put to film. Literally, perfect.
