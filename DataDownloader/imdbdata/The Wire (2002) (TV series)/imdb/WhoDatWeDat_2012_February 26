2012_February 26 
I will start by saying I hate T.V shows and that is because most of
them are pointless from week to week and last about 6 years too long.
Not so with The Wire, I am just recently watching this show and I will
say it is best watched on DVD. A lot happens from episode to episode
and all of it is important. Like David Mamet&#x27;s writing everything is
important and nothing is there just to fill up the hour. Very rarely
does anything on screen pull you in to the setting and make you feel as
if you are there. I will say however the language is rated RRRRRR, if
there are enough R&#x27;s, the F word is used frequently, which may turn
many away. The series is so good because they care about plot its not a
monster of the week and you are often left with more questions than
answers at the end of each episode. That being said in a few months I
will watch it all over again.
