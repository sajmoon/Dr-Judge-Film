Never have I seen a television show show complex, so encompassing, and
so darn good. David Simon and Ed Burns have crafted a thought-provoking
view of the entire city of Baltimore. It shows the perspectives of
cops, politicians, drug dealers, students, teachers, and everyone in
between. This show is five seasons of the trials and tribulations of
the city of Baltimore. It provides a no-holds-barred look at drug
trafficking and the cops&#39; relentless attempts to counter it. It shows
the problems in inner city schools and the tough politics of the
mayor&#39;s office. It show multi-layered tales of right and wrong and of
morality. It asks how far can cops go to stop the &quot;bad guys.&quot; And it
asks how bad are some of the drug dealers if the school system fails
them and they are drawn to crime to feed themselves and their families.
The issues the show deals more socially relevant than some of the
issues our own government talks about. Not to mention it has some of
television&#39;s best characters ranging from Idris Elba&#39;s almost criminal
mastermind Stringer Bell, Dominic West&#39;s often drunk but relentless in
his quest for justice Detective Jimmy Mcnulty, and Jamie Hector&#39;s
vicious but ruthlessly effective drug king Marlo Stanfield. The Wire
has it all, relevant issues, great acting, great writing, and yes,
great entertainment. It simply is the BEST. SHOW. EVER.
