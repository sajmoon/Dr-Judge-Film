There is nothing perfect in this world, and no one would be as likely
to agree more strongly with this fact than this show&#x27;s creator, Mr.
David Simon himself. However, Simon possesses an eye for detail in his
writing which is rarely seen through the medium of film - a level of
detail which calls for perfection despite knowing it is impossible to
achieve. This writing caliber is more reserved for literary greats like
Twain and Fitzgerald. Simon saw the big picture of his city, and in
doing so created a living, breathing portrait of a time period in
Baltimore, Maryland that, because of him, will never be forgotten. Of
course, there are hundreds of incredibly talented actors, many just
kids pulled from the streets, a great number of other writers and
directors, and many hundreds of other people without whom we would
never have seen these five seasons of glory.<br /><br />However, in the end this series was one man&#x27;s unflinching vision of the
big, real problems which our individual actions create. Each season of
this show dissects an important part of modern society (law, work,
crime, education, media) through the eyes of the inner city, in a way
no one has or probably ever will do again (except Simon himself,
perhaps).<br /><br />If you want to restore some of your faith in humanity, just look at the
fact that HBO let Simon keep The Wire on, essentially, as long as he
wanted to, knowing that Simon was painting the television equivalent of
a Van Gogh, albeit arguably with more substance and undoubtedly with
more modern relevance - despite TERRIBLE ratings throughout.<br /><br />After all, this was truly a television novel, if you don&#x27;t start from
chapter 1, it won&#x27;t make sense. Yes, chapter 1 seems slow at first, but
give it time. You haven&#x27;t even met Omar yet! The saddest part about The
Wire is that most people who have the ability to watch this show,
myself included, can only relate to this struggle VIA the show and
while there are ways in which individuals can help, Simon&#x27;s show
ultimately paints a picture of one city (which could be superimposed on
many others in this country) which may seem fixable from the outside,
but is rotting, utterly hopeless inside.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know if any other movie or show can show the darkest depths of
the human soul as poetically.<br /><br />Describing it any more depth would be unfair, but if I ever call
anything perfect it is this. I wish IMDb had an 11th star, because The
Wire is truly the only thing I have ever seen that 100% DESERVES the
ten I gave it.<br /><br />Just a note - Treme is almost as good, but in a slightly differing way
(smaller scale, more about normal people than cops) at painting a
portrait of post-Katrina New Orleans. David Simon owns, basically.
George Pelecanos and Eric Overmeyer as well.
