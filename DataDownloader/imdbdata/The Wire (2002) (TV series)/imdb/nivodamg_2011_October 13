Imagine a wire. Its thin and to walk on it is difficult. If you tried,
most of the time you will be on the one side or the other. The left is
white, the right is black and the wire is grey - good, bad and moral
dilemmas.<br /><br />I think people believe we are good or bad, and our decisions too. But
actually, most of the time, I think people are walking that wire - not
good, not bad, but rather, grey: undecided and confused.<br /><br />The show has a great way of telling a story, memorable acting and
spine- chilling quote after quote of dialogue. But what I love most
about the show is the honesty and daring with which it presents the
greyness of people - that thin grey line we walk every day when trying
to live a good life, while being tempted to stray by those values that
are often in conflict with being good (e.g. getting power, the ego,
making more money, keeping power, our endless wants and desires).<br /><br />The show suggests there are good people and there are bad. But most
good are sometimes bad and most bad can be good when it really counts.
There are some that are always good, and some that are always and truly
bad. I suppose they just can not help it; its either in their nature or
they&#x27;re victims of some other social condition - their upbringing,
their neighbourhood or sometimes its just a series of unlikely and
unfortunate events that have made them who they are. <br /><br />But when you look a little deeper you find some interesting moral
conflicts - the grey wire I&#x27;ve been referring too. Sometimes those that
are always and truly bad can make other bad guys do good (e.g. Omar vs
Marlo). Sometimes the truly bad can also make the good do something bad
just to put an end to their reign (e.g. McNulty vs Marlo). You will
also find that the uncompromisingly good may, at the same time, be
doing both the wrong thing by refusing to bend and yet at other times
their solid position is the only thing that keeps others on the right
side (e.g. Daniels). <br /><br />As for what is good and bad - well the show&#x27;s characters definitely
have some very different perceptions of what these things mean and it
comes across: the unwritten code by which the gangsters, the teachers,
the journalists and the cops all live by - all different and everyone
follows it to a different degree... some even write it.<br /><br />I think in the end the message I got is that it is far easier to be bad
and get away with it than it is to be good and get rewarded for it.
Which is odd as you would expect it to be the other way round. This
kind of society provides more incentives to gangsters to be bad than it
does to those that try to live good lives.<br /><br />We all walk the wire every day. We don&#x27;t always make the right
decisions and for as long as we are human, it is unlikely we will ever
learn to. The only hope we have is that the good will begin to cross
the wire less often and the bad will cross it to the good side more
frequently. As for the truly good and truly bad...<br /><br />&#x22;when you walk through the garden, you better watch you back&#x22;
