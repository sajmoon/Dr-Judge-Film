I can&#39;t think of any other show that&#39;s as well written and compelling.
If you go into it thinking it&#39;s a cops and robbers show, you&#39;re in for
an eye-opener. The cops are the good guys - except sometimes they&#39;re
not. The drug dealers are the bad guys, except sometimes they&#39;re not.
Every character is three dimensional and complex. In watching the first
three seasons for the second time, you see things that they allude to,
or characters they set up in the first season, that they flesh out a
season or two later. And at the time, you&#39;re not completely aware that
it&#39;s happening, but it leaves it&#39;s mark.<br /><br />This is the only show that I&#39;ve ever taken the time to videotape and
keep every episode. Brilliant.<br /><br />The Wire is really not interested in good and evil. It&#39;s interested in
economics and sociology and politics. - David Simon.
