The wire is simply amazing. David Simon has created a frightfully
realistic portrayal of the drug trade in Baltimore. David Simon has not
only written what i believe to be the greatest television show of all
time, but a television show that will be remembered, just for being
great. the acting throughout the entire series was incredible. i didn&#x27;t
even realise Dominic West was British until i saw him in an interview,
that was how good his accent was. so for all the saps out there who
believe that the Sopranos is the greatest show of all time, will be
surprised and a bit embarrassed when they watch the wire. so please
watch this show if want to know what real TV is. Nuff Said
