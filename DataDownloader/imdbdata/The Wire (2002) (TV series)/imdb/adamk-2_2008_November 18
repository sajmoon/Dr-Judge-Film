I got given the first season of this on DVD after expressing disbelief
at the incredible hype going on about it in a certain UK newspaper. I
was told that, once I&#39;d watched it, I&#39;d see what all the fuss was
about. Well, I finally finished season 1. I won&#39;t be bothering with
season 2.<br /><br />This is an average procedural, nothing more or less, stuffed with an
array of interchangeable and forgettable characters (I couldn&#39;t for the
life of me remember who was who, and soon began not to care) and
clich&eacute;s galore. You want the the maverick cop who plays by his own
rules, speaks his mind, pisses of his stuffed-shirt, officious
superiors but gets results? Whose dedication to his job has cost him
his marriage and left him with a drink habit (signalled by occasional
swigs at a bottle)? Well, one can never get enough of THIS sort of
character, obviously, so bring him on, have him played woodenly and be
done with it. You get the usual weary battery of petty, lazy, fat
and/or balding officials who get in the way, just for contrast, and
they all but ask for his badge and his gun and/or give him 48 hours.<br /><br />And so it dragged on, the self-conscious dialogue dribbling forth. You
want the beautiful and ballsy lesbian cop expounding non-sensically on
her reasons for being a cop to her (fortuitously gorgeous) lesbian
friends? Want to see a fat cop enter his superior&#39;s office and start,
for some reason, to talk about how he was masturbating in the bath?
And, no, his superior does not, as in any real world, ask him to get
out or get to the point, but merely smiles and nods indulgently (&#39;cos
he&#39;s an a-hole, too, geddit?). The cringe moments come thick and fast,
one of my favourites being the moment that the cop I came to call
Morgan Freeman interviewed the Tart-with-a-Heart (another clich&eacute;) at
his desk, conveniently littered with the miniature furniture he makes
(contrived plot point, there)and for some reason didn&#39;t see fit to
clear away. He tells her to choose one that she likes and, yes, she
chooses the cradle with the baby in it and coos, ickily.<br /><br />Lovers of clich&eacute;s will also be able to spot who&#39;s about to get wasted
in advance. If you can&#39;t....well, hand in your gun and badge.
