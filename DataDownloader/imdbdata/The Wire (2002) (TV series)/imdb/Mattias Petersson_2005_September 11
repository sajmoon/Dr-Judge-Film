2005_September 11 
I have just finished watching the first season of this series on DVD.
Even though i've so far only seen one season i still feel i need to
comment on it.<br /><br />It was with great anticipation i started watching this series. Most of
all because of all the people that recommended it and heralded it as
one of the more realistic and well-made cop shows in recent time. But
also because of HBO's track record when it comes to quality shows. So,
were my expectations put to shame? No, this is generally a solid show
although it does have some problems.<br /><br />The problem that is most disturbing is the pace. The setup of this show
reminded me a little bit about &quot;24&quot;. Not because of the time-line or
anything like that, rather because they work the same case during the
whole season. And just like &quot;24&quot; i don't know if i would have had the
stamina to watch it one episode a week. While the problem with &quot;24&quot; is
the high pace and many side-plots to keep track of, this show's problem
is the slow beginning. Like most HBO-shows one season here is 13
episodes. And the first three episodes were a let-down for me,
especially the first episode which was in my opinion awful. They
introduced the cast by letting them roam around doing nothing saying
the &quot;F-word&quot; a lot. That is NOT a good way to start something like
this.<br /><br />Had i watched it on TV that would probably have been it for me. But
since i had the chance to keep on pushing further and seeing a couple
of episodes at a time i kept going. And little by little the show
improved, right up until the last 3-4 episodes which are great.
Especially the ending was very satisfying in my opinion.<br /><br />So, why do i feel i need to comment on it even though i've only seen
one out of (presently) three seasons? Simply because i'm afraid that
people might react the way that i did when they start watching this
show. It's simply not very strong in the beginning and that may put you
off so that you stop watching it. But then you'd miss the satisfying
continuation and resolution that makes the whole series worth the wait.<br /><br />In the end this is not going to become one of my favorite shows. The
characters and plot are a little too weak and uninteresting for that.
But it is a very solid TV-series that is certainly far superior to most
crap on TV (like for instance the whole &quot;CSI&quot;-franchise). So the final
word is still: recommended.
