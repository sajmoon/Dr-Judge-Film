Pssst.... hey! Wanna know a secret? Watch &quot;The Wire&quot;. Whilst HBO has
made a name for itself in creating amazing television programmes which
rival Hollywood in terms of challenging content, originality and
ambition, &quot;The Wire&quot; stands out. I&#39;ll go so far as to say that it is
even better than &quot;The Sopranos&quot; now.<br /><br />The problem, however, is that it is not a show which screams &quot;WATCH
ME!&quot; First of all, it&#39;s (ostensibly) a cop drama, and it&#39;s not as if we
don&#39;t have hundreds of those to choose from, and secondly the decidedly
unglamourous cast and even less glamorous setting of Baltimore aren&#39;t
exactly what could be described as a feast for the eyes. But time and
effort reap rewards, and those who do so will be able to enjoy rich
characterisation and a dense and layered storyline.<br /><br />What is so impressive about &quot;The Wire&quot; is the fact that it is not
content just to be another cop show, or indeed, another television
show. In telling the interrelated stories of police detectives, drug
dealers, junkies, lawyers, politicians, schoolteachers and school
children it works as much as a dissection and examination of the
institutions of the city of Baltimore as well as the war on drugs.
There is something rather Dickensian in all this and, just like in
later Dickens, you feel a sense of impotent rage simmering beneath
surface as you follow the narrative.<br /><br />A small caveat: do not expect easy answers, quick solutions or, indeed,
happy endings. This isn&#39;t &quot;CSI&quot; or even &quot;The Shield&quot;. This is
uncompromisingly bleak television, yet leavened with humour and a keen
sense of humanity. In short, it is a humble television show which puts
even most cinematic efforts to shame.
