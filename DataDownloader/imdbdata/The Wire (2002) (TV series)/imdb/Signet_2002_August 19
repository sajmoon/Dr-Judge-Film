If you have missed THE WIRE, you have missed one of 2002's best television
productions.  The acting is superb, the writing is fantastic, and the
direction is elegant.  This is the armored underbelly of Baltimore at its
most grim, accurately depicted and wonderfully detailed.  This isn't
merely
great television, this is great drama, with heroes and villains who are
never all good and certainly not all bad.  The performances are, without
exception, marvelous and everybody involved with this magnificent series
deserves to be honored when they start passing out the
awards.
