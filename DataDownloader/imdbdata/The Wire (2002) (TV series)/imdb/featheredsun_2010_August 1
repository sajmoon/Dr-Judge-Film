Not like anyone&#x27;s gonna read this, but I gotta say my piece. The Wire
is better than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen on TV, network or cable, and
that narrowly beats out Rome and Band of Brothers - and here&#x27;s why:
Five whole seasons of tight plot and fully fleshed characterization.
This series delivers the goods over five plus years of creative skill
and that&#x27;s not something to take lightly.<br /><br />Every character is fleshed out, from the ostensible &#x22;main character&#x22; of
Jimmy McNulty to the no-account villain that is Marlo Stanfield. Every
player in this grand drama is fully developed and worth devoting your
thoughts to.<br /><br />I am pretty picky when it comes to handing the title of Best TV Ever,
but I got to give it to Simon and his associates on this particular
endeavor. The continuity and depth of this series decided it. It is a
must-see for anyone who believes there is worthy television programming
out there that can qualify as strongly as ART as any movie made.<br /><br />I was originally thinking of buzzing this as &#x22;The best Cop Drama ever,&#x22;
but it is, through the attention paid to it, the best TV Show that I&#x27;ve
ever seen, period.<br /><br />The flaws are, that it gives ALL of its main characters a fair shake,
even if they don&#x27;t deserve it. The strength of it is the same. plus the
detailed and lovingly produced environment it puts the viewer in.
Surely the folk of Baltimore could do no better than such a lovingly,
merciless, portrayal of their fair city. And no portrait painted could
better capture the spirit of any great American city, as this art
achieves.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t downloaded or rented this series yet, you are missing
out. The hype is for real. As Omar Little once said, &#x22;How you expect to
run with the wolves come night when you spend all day sparring with the
puppies?&#x22; If you&#x27;ve never watched this series, you don&#x27;t fully know
what television can do.
