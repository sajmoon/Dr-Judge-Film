This is TV at its best - great story lines, fantastic scripts and
wonderful acting. Watched the box sets compulsively! I would hesitate
just a little to say that the themes covered (crime, punishment, love,
loyalty, betrayal, passion) are handled in a sweeping, Shakespearean
way ....but only just. The characters are simply sublime and the
interplay between the main protagonists is deftly handled and with an
nod to hard, gritty realism, humor and sensitivity (yes, even in a show
about the inner city drug wars). Really wish that all TV was written
this way. For me, the only thing on network TV that has come close is
&#x22;Lost&#x22; - another very well put together show, albeit very different.
More, please (though, sadly, I know there won&#x27;t be any)!!
