I read one of the earlier headlines that said this show ruined TV for
them. And it did the same to me. I was watching other dramas and I
heard of the Wire, so I bought the whole series and it ruined any other
drama show I was watching. Through comparison, there is none. I went
back to watch the other drama shows and though these shows suck and
there is no realism there at all and the depth was nowhere near the
depth of the wire. I had first seen the Sopranos, which I thought was a
great cutting edge drama and a fantastic show. Then I saw the wire and
there is no comparison. Where ever someone may say the wire is weak or
its weakest season (and I don&#x27;t think it has one), that season or
episode is still stronger than any other drama on TV or from the past. <br /><br />Getting to the show with that said, the ensemble cast is fantastic.
This show doesn&#x27;t follow clich&#xE9;s of the cops being great people and the
bad guys having no human side. It shows cops as assholes and drug
dealers as actual people and not just people that deal drugs. It shows
cases aren&#x27;t made like that and then solved and the people in the
department don&#x27;t always want a case. With other drama shows where the
creators are trying to show they know more than you, The Wire will tell
you what you know about drug dealers and cops with never ending depth.
There are so many great characters, it is hard to pick a favorite. The
difference in the show however is the creators have real life
experience. David Simon worked as a reporter and Ed Burns was a cop in
Baltimore for over 20 years. This people have created a visual
experience seen on TV like absolutely nothing ever before it. <br /><br />The greatest show of all time with little competition.
