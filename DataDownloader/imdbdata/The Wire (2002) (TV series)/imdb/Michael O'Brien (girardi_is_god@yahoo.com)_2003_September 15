I have to admit, I was a bit worried that Season 2 of THE WIRE would not
live up to Season 1. But the second season is definitely as good as it's
incredible debut. The same cops, the same drug dealers, and a new angle in
the dock workers. I feel for them the same way I feel for the cops and the
dealers. Even though Frank, Nick, and Ziggy all get involved in some crooked
stuff, they all have their reasons and are all likable guys. Frank's doing
the dirt for his union. Nick needs  to provide for his young family, but
doesn't get enough shifts on the docks to cover a decent apartment. And
Ziggy, while he is a screw up and an idiot, is really just trying to get out
from under his father's shadow. The case is as complex and involving as the
first season, and the end as compelling. I understand they have been picked
up for another season, and that's great to hear. Even though a lot of people
are not haven't discovered THE WIRE, those of us who have were spellbound.
10 out of 10.
