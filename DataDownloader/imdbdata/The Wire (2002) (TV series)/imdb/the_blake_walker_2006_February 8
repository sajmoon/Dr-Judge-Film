This is not a show with an anti-drug message or an anti-crime message.
This is quite simply a show that juxtaposes those who do their jobs
well with those who don't. There inlays the drama, thusly creating a
show devoid of clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />It's also about politics and bureaucracy on both sides of the law. When
it comes to drugs the criminals have no trouble mobilizing. When it
comes to law enforcement it's amazing that anything gets done.<br /><br />There are drug dealers and criminals on the show doing inherently
criminal behavior who are not bad people and there are policemen on the
show doing the right things for all the wrong reasons who are terrible
people.<br /><br />Even if the cast wasn't priceless the writing is so good that it would
carry home a lesser group of actors. There are countless moments
throughout the first and second seasons between Avon Barksdale,
Stringer Bell and D'Angelo Barksdale to rival the best moments of the
first two Godfather films. <br /><br />Watching this show has ruined a lot of other television shows and
movies for me. I realize how forgiving I have become towards shows that
default to sensationalism, melodrama and common clich&eacute;s for lack of
imagination. The writers of this show have a keen ability to keep it
simple and to find God in the details. <br /><br />This is the most well written show on television. Arguably the most
well written show of all time.
