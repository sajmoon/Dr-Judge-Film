What can I say, I have seen a lot of TV-series from the States and
mostly Britain but this crime/social-realism drama takes the biscuit.<br /><br />This has got to be the absolute best TV-acting I have seen. The people
in this series become so real and vibrant and you find yourself
actually caring about a drug-addict, Bubbles and a gay gangster, Omar.<br /><br />Damn but these guys have done an excellent job. I have never been to
America but I must admit that I did feel that the production crew
really painted a realistic picture of a drug-infested ghetto. If sets
were used they were used sparingly which maxes the realism.<br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t seen The Wire do so. It&#x27;s absolutely worth your time and
the realism and acting is mind-boggling.<br /><br />/michael stilborg copenhagen
