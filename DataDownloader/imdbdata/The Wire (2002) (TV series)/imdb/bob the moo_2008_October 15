2008_October 15 
I have written individual reviews for each season of this as I have
gone through them and, having finished the fifth and final season, I
wanted to review the entire series as a finished product &#150; which it
sadly now is. I came to The Wire as many people have &#150; on DVD for the
first seasons till I was caught up and joined it on FX UK. It was the
constant critical praise for the show that attracted me but I was still
wary that it would be mostly hype and that a &quot;good&quot; show would be
undone in my mind due to the weight of expectation. The first few
episodes offer you nothing like 24&#39;s exploding plane to hook you or
thrill you and a colleague of mine bailed out after one episode,
describing it as &quot;people mumbling for an hour&quot;. I can sort of
understand this because you do not start watching The Wire thinking
&quot;this is awesome&quot; but within 3 or 4 episodes you suddenly realise that
you are in the middle of a densely populated story that develops
character and plot with the deftest of touches.<br /><br />It is not one &quot;moment&quot; or a matter of having sufficient good moments to
make the show but just the sheer depth and consistency of writing
across each and every episode. Season 5 is the only significant loss of
this and even when this happens (as it does too frequently in S5) it
still leaves a &quot;very good&quot; show. Seasons 1-4 are near perfect though
and the show is endlessly complex, intelligent, exciting and thrilling.
Again this is not to suggest that it has &quot;big&quot; moments that stand-out
such as action sequences (although it does) but that you will be drawn
into the story and characters to such an extent that you will find a
four minute review of a crime scene with the dialogue variations on the
F word to be fascinating and enthralling.<br /><br />However it is not one or two characters that are well drawn but rather
almost all of them are convincing and engaging. West&#39;s McNulty is of
course the &quot;main&quot; character and his superior, drunken sh1t-stirrer is
very real but the show provides just as much fleshing out for minor
cops, politicians, drug lords, corner kids, junkies and thieves. Royo&#39;s
Bubbles is another great character than is very much the emotional
heart of the show, never letting us dismiss users as just &quot;junkies&quot;. I
won&#39;t start listing others because it would fill the review but special
mention to Stringer Bell, who is wonderful, season 3 in particular. The
one exception to the &quot;realism&quot; of the show is Omar, who is a fantastic
creation of cocky control and cool &#150; he doesn&#39;t fit that well into the
world created but he is still a lot of fun and the writers ensure that
season 5 sees him harshly brought back into the world that all the
other characters inhabit. The acting is roundly excellent and fans may
have forgotten that the cast doesn&#39;t feature many faces you will know
apart from a couple from Homicide etc, but yet this approach works
because it allows us to only know Elba as Stringer, West as McNulty,
Doman as Rawls, Pierce as Bunk and so on. They are well served by the
writers and they respond to it accordingly; the only depressing thing
is that for many of them they will never have it this good again.<br /><br />I will not go on about it because I think that The Wire doesn&#39;t need my
praise and my hype to tell people that it is good. Generally I have
found that the best way to do that is to put the DVD in someone&#39;s hand
and tell them to give it three hours of their time as a start &#150; after
that few have given up on it but rather have gone on to watch all five
seasons. People can tell a product of quality when they see one, and
that is what The Wire is. It may have been completely ignored by the
Emmys and other major awards but it does and will have the last laugh
because this is a show that will stand for decades as one of the finest
ever made. Do yourself a favour and get ahead of those who will
discover it when it starts topping &quot;best of&quot; lists and give it a chance
now because once you are drawn into it you will agree that it is
nothing less than awesome.
