A slightly more pragmatic and efficacious attempt to deal with the drug
problem. Brilliant dialogue,if highly profane: &quot;You&#39;re the perfect
bait. They will view you as conflicted, you&#39;re homophobia is so
visceral.&quot; &quot;See that. I haven&#39;t even walked in the place yet and you&#39;re
already calling me a c********r.&quot; To paraphrase Barry Sheene,you have
got to give them points for that. Hard,sharp and dark(noirish)and the
downside of a clever police officer&#39;s actions,which came at the risk of
his career,was turned into a positive at the political level,as it was
suggested that his unorthodox approach could be suggested as a new
initiative to combat the drug problem by the elected police hierarchy.
Clever stuff.
