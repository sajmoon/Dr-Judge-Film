Another glorified cop drama. HBO has the best drama and comedies on TV,
at least in the States, but it&#x27;s nowhere near the &#x22;Sopranos&#x22; and is
unworthy of mention when compared to &#x22;Six Feet Under.&#x22; The later was
original and had remarkable acting. &#x22;The Wire&#x22; is a good show, but in
the end just another police drama parading as social commentary.<br /><br />The lack of censorship is one reason for the show&#x27;s success, and
although many people find this show challenging, I don&#x27;t. Anyone with a
decent education, some life experience under their belt and fortunate
enough to travel out of this country will find this show leaving them
yawning and easily predicting the outcome of most episodes.
