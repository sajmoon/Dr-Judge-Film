Amazing show...<br /><br />if you want to know how politics intertwines with the drug trade and
how the enforcement is swayed by political strategies, this is the show
to watch. it is amazingly portrayed, acting is incredible (as usual
with HBO shows), and the entire show is dramatic and educational
simultaneously.<br /><br />Comparable to sopranos for its nonstop, heartpouding episodes, this
show can sum up why our society is so messed up and why people often
can&#39;t get help for the situations in which they are born.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.
