I&#x27;d heard of The Wire long before it was finally aired on British
network television, all of the things I&#x27;d heard were good. Often
glowing reviews lead to high expectations which aren&#x27;t quite met...
that wasn&#x27;t the case here, The Wire lived up to its reputation as one
of the best television shows ever. It helped that all five series were
shown over a few months as opposed to five years so there was no
opportunity for the viewer to lose track of who was who in the large
cast.<br /><br />At first glance it might appear that the this is just another cop show
but it is far more than that, not only does it show both sides of
crime, which is unusual, it shows how that crime permeates through the
City of Baltimore: politicians want the statistics massaged so it looks
like they are doing something about the ever constant crime but don&#x27;t
want to supply the money to do something really useful, the schools
where the children are being taught how to pass the tests but not
learning anything that will help them escape the life in the drug trade
they seem to be destined for and a political system where everybody is
just trying to get into higher office and keep it once they get there.<br /><br />With a large cast played mainly by actors I didn&#x27;t know it might be
expected that it would be hard to keep track of who was who. Luckily
the cast all did a great job so that even though I couldn&#x27;t remember
every name it was easy to remember how they fitted into the story.
While I don&#x27;t think there were any weak actors there were many who
stood out; Dominic West brought a degree of humour to the series as
Detective McNulty, Idris Elba as &#x22;Stringer&#x22; Bell, the drug dealer who
wanted to keep things low profile and businesslike rather than a
constant war and Felicia Pearson who was brilliant as &#x22;Snoop&#x22;, a senior
member of one of the drug dealing gangs who thinks nothing of killing
anybody who even vaguely threatens them. I have a feeling that a lot of
the cast will go on to become well known in many roles as they have
proved themselves so well here.<br /><br />I certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoys serious drama that
isn&#x27;t of the &#x22;case of the week&#x22; variety, be warned however there is a
lot of swearing and violence that some viewers may not be comfortable
with although none of it seemed gratuitous to me. While it may not have
won awards I am certain people will still be talking about this years
after the programmes that won the awards are forgotten.
