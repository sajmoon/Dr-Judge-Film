The Wire delivers over and over again in this remarkable television
series that will serve as the bench mark for what television can be.<br /><br />The city of Baltimore, along with an enormous cast of virtual unknowns,
star prominently in a story, spread over 5 years, of the breaking down
of America. It is unfixable. The so-called &#x27;war on drugs&#x27; is a farce
and the police and politicians, media and schools play a complicated
game of &#x27;crime solving.&#x27; Cases are built, plots are laid like threads
over the show&#x27;s length and it all culminates in unexpected ways.
Criminals are heroes, Cops are criminals. There is no black and white.
There are no quick Hollywood fixes.<br /><br />Brimming with tragedy, comedy, drama, Dickensian in its scope, this is
a series to be watched in one week if possible. Just to keep the
threads in order. There are many. This is not something to watch while
chatting with others. It requires a dedicated attention span.<br /><br />From beginning to end, it throws stereotypes out the window and brings
a humanity and depth to even the most minor bit part. Long after
watching it, the characters still haunt in their complexity.<br /><br />Stunning. Compelling. Visually powerful. Thought provoking. This series
will tell the story of the collapse of the American dream. If there
ever was such a premise. It should be required watching for all
students of politics and the demography of urban economics.<br /><br />Absolutely the best of what television has ever offered.<br /><br />10 out of 10.
