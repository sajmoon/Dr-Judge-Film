2011_July 8 
I have finally finished the complete series. It took me a month to
watch it completely, and it was completely worth it. I am going to try
and write a decent review and do the series justice, but I don&#x27;t know
if I will be able to.<br /><br />At first, The Wire is merely a very pretty good show that has a lot of
different characters and story lines. I appreciated it and enjoyed it
to a minimal extent, but never truly loved it. Even after the first
season I wasn&#x27;t entirely in it&#x27;s grasp. I felt sort of the same feeling
with the second season. I think that this season is definitely the
season with the most different tone. Point being, I stuck with it
because I could sense what type of show this was- a slow-burner.
Somewhere between the third and fourth season I realized what a great
achievement this was. It wasn&#x27;t that the series was improving. I
wouldn&#x27;t say that at all. It was just that it was me. I had gotten
familiar with it, with the characters, story lines, and themes and
realism it brings. Sure enough, the feeling the show brought at the end
of each episode was that of complete satisfaction. It never went for
cheap thrills, or cheap manipulation or emotion. It demanded attention
and time, and at the end I would be getting my &#x27;paycheck&#x27; so to speak.
I can definitely see why many people have seen the first couple of
episodes and then tuned out. I am extremely grateful that I stuck by it
to the end.<br /><br />Without giving any spoilers, I want to talk about the actors here.
Completely unrecognizable, and had never seen them before (besides
Idris Elba). Yet, I don&#x27;t remember any important character being played
lousy or falsely. There are so many excellent performances here. The
performances of the &#x27;street&#x27; characters, like Omar, Bubbles, Stringer,
D&#x27;Angelo, Avon, and Snoop to the performances of the &#x27;heroes&#x27;- McNulty,
Greggs, Daniels, Freamon, Carver, Bunk. Then there are those who
appeared based on their institution by season- the politician Thomas
Carcetti, the high-class elite of &#x27;the Greek&#x27; and the Sobotkas, the
school kids Michael, Naymond, Randy and Dookie, and the news media- Gus
Haynes and Scott Templeton. There is a large number of characters that
are as compelling as any imaginable. I also want to give a shout out to
the cinematography, which never became colorized or stylized. One might
say it looked &#x27;dull&#x27; compared to other big cable shows, but it only
added to the meaning of the TV series. <br /><br />Ultimately, The Wire probably joins together with Breaking Bad as the
best television shows I have ever seen. It&#x27;s uncompromising, honest,
brutal, realistic, and ultimately completely rich in it&#x27;s meaning.
Words cannot express just what I mean by that, but hopefully people
seek it out.
