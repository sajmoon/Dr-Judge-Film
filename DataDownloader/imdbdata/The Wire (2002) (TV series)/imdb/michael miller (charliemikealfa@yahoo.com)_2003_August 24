This is without a doubt the best thing on t.v., movies, ect.  In this series
you ever learn to care about some of the &quot;bad guys&quot; very
unusual!
The acting is outstanding, as is the writing, directing. although i know
nothing of acting, ect. i have been a cop for 25 years plus, and i know
every one of those people.Names are different ect.. but those cops are
people i know, or have known. I like mr. West's character. That is
me,unfortunately. The &quot;fly in the ointment&quot;
This is entertainment at it's best. The bad guys are &quot;in the wind&quot; Justice
perhaps next season. You have to like Stringer although he
is
on the wrong side of the law. HBO...Keep it up!!!!!!!
