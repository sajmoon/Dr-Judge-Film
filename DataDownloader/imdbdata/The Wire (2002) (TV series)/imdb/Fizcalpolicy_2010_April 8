I embarrassingly dismissed this show when it first aired. A friend
insisted I watch it, instinctively suspecting I would love it, but I
just wasn&#x27;t patient enough to give it a chance. Years later, after it&#x27;s
conclusion, I decided to give it another go. Another go basically
turned into an addiction. What sets The Wire apart from other HBO shows
is the initial work laid out for the viewer. The viewer must put the
work into paying careful attention to what&#x27;s going on in the beginning.
It requires thought. As &#x22;street&#x22; as the show is, there is something
cerebral about it. And unlike The Sopranos (another favorite), The Wire
doesn&#x27;t have a catchy or glamorous theme to push along for the initial
ratings game; it&#x27;s pure grit, and holds back no punches. And to make my
point, The wire will never air on A&#x26;E, simply because it is too raw; or
should I say too real? Like watching an artist painting a portrait or a
landscape, you at first wonder what point or angle the artist is trying
to project onto the canvass. As the work begins taking shape, you step
back in awe, wondering HOW the hell he or she did? The Wire is art; and
like any brilliant art form, some (in this case, a minuscule) just wont
get it. Everyone, even the young kids in junior high, was perfectly
cast for each role. And don&#x27;t get me started on the amazing writing. Mr
Mammet couldn&#x27;t touch the dialog!! Before writing this review, I
checked the ratings of The Wire in comparison to other HBO shows. To
date, it has the highest.
