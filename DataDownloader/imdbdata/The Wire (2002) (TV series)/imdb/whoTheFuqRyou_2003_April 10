Such a great show about the drug game through the eyes of the cops and
hustlers.  Everybody here fits their part relatively well. But I'm really
impressed with Michael K. Williams(Bullet) as Omar, the gay stick-up kid. 
His character is very deep 'cause it shows how jail-life changed him. 
Hassan Johnson is one of my favorites in this show as Wee-Bey, a role that
fits him well. But it's Idris Elba as Stringer, the heart and soul of the
Barksdale(Wood Harris) organized crime ring that really holds this show
down.  Great script and great acting - very authentic and is very
true-to-life<br /><br />my favorite TV show, I follow this thing like it was a
religion
impatiently waitin' for this on DVD and the second season as
well
