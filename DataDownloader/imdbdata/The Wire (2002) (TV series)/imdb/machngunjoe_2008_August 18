And do you know why its the best? Because it ends. So many shows go on
and on and on, when they&#39;ve got nothing else to write. Some shows feel
they must continue along with a story, long after all interesting
resources have been used. Six Feet Under and Sopranos comes to mind Not
the Wire.<br /><br />After Six seasons they hang up the gloves and all six seasons are
fantastic. I actually wish they would continue as there is more grit
and dirt to uncover in the story telling.<br /><br />Every character has great depth and there are many characters to get to
know.<br /><br />And most of this series is some what based on a true story.<br /><br />Its wonderful and meaningful. I love how everybody is not perfect they
are just trying to bypass the system to actually get something done. A
plague all cities face.
