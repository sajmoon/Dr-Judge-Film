2003_June 4 

In 2002, I caught a few episodes and was a little lost about who's who.
However, the curiousity gradually grew and I'm a full fledged fan. The
acting is great and it has an unpredictable quality.<br /><br />Its like someone said ... Lets take some gangsters, make it gritty, add a
few murders and pit good against evil. Also, lets make it slightly more
complicated so people will need to see the re-runs to figure a few of the
details out.<br /><br />When the series ended in 2003 I figured the series would end, since the
ending was not open-ended. However, in 2003 after one new episode, the
show
already left viewers curious about the new characters added, while keeping
one aware of the few previous characters that made the show so
special.
