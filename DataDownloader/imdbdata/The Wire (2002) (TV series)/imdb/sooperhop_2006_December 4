I get bored real quick and grow real tired of TV that insults my
commonsense and/or strays from the original writing that started me off
watching the show in the first place. Most TV either starts off decent
and goes down hill quick, or just plain stinks. IMO The Sapranos is one
of those shows that started good but has stunk for the last 2 to 3
seasons.<br /><br />BUT NOT THE WIRE!!! despite the occasional turd of &quot;modern&quot; liberalism
that the viewer is forced to swallow, this show is never boring and is
as realistic as TV can be! because no TV or movie can be written these
days without some liberalism forced fed into it, i can swallow the
occasional turd. (as though i will become a liberal voter because a TV
character persuaded me...LOL) anyhow....i never watch anything twice
but i plan on a wire rewind when the series is over starting from
se1-ep1. with so much going on and the seasons meshing into one another
so well, i&#39;m sure i missed a third of all of the interconnect going&#39;s
on&#39;s!<br /><br />i enjoy CSI and 24, but i flat out love The Wire!! GREAT SHOW!!
