I find it near impossible to avoid the clich&#xE9; and hyperbole that will
doubtless spew from my mind in attempting to do justice to this show.<br /><br />Every second of this show oozes with authenticity and meaning. The
creators, god bless them, were clearly motivated to produce a work of
depth and realism, each series focusing on an integral dissection of
the problems that face Baltimore.<br /><br />Never has television so faithfully and thoroughly involved itself and
the narrative in the hierarchy of power and corruption that contribute
towards the endemic poverty and exploitation of a city and its people -
from the &#x27;ground level&#x27; violence to the docks, City Hall and the press.<br /><br />Many shows would doubtlessly skip certain aspects of Baltimore&#x27;s drug
problem in search of a glamorised, more convenient and commercial
storyline that would sit more comfortably with the masses. It is this
attention to detail and distancing from the &#x27;24-esque hourly
cliffhanger&#x27; that has to a certain extent, removed the show from the
commercial success of other one-hour dramas.<br /><br />The fact remains that at its most divided, The Wire is five feature
films and at its heart a great work of literature, a Dickensian novel
for the 21st Century. For this reason I would recommend that The Wire
is best consumed on DVD.<br /><br />From the casting, to the honesty, the performances and the writing, The
Wire is a truly epic show and an indication that Television has more to
offer in a world where cinema has dominated the genre of quality drama.<br /><br />This show is like your first love....the best, the least tainted, but
like that first love, it is a sad truth that it will more than likely,
never be matched.
