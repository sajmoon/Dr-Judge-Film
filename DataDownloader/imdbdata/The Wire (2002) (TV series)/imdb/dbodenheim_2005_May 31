I really don't know what to say about &quot;the Wire.&quot; I am a fan of
Deadwood, the Shield, Sopranos,etc, etc. Comparing this show to the
pre-mentioned, and to say &quot;the Wire&quot; is a better show, is a high
compliment coming from me. I have never seen a TV show with such clear
direction on where the story is going. You can see things that are
going to happen 3 episodes down the road, but the way in which it gets
you there is worth every second. Every character in the show is as
believable as they come. My hats off to the casting team that must of
spent grueling amounts of time to pick the EXACT right person for every
role. Whats great about the Wire is that every season just keeps
topping the last one. Season 1 was fantastic, but Season 2 just delved
even deeper and deeper. HBO spends the time to get into these
characters psyche so you can see what motivates them to take the
actions they do. Not a lot of show do that, but &quot;the Wire&quot; does. By
showing motives, you start caring for the characters, whether they are
lawful or not. It simply amazes me that this show isn't as mainstream
as it is. Maybe its because &quot;the Wire&quot; doesn't always have the shock
moments like Sopranos and Deadwood. The subtlety works for me though.
It creates layers of plot so when that shock moment in the show does
come, it hits like a ton of bricks.<br /><br />***** out of *****
