If you like TV series with slow plot builds, developing characters and
a lot of grit and realism, The Wire is it. I just caught Season 1 on
DVD and can&#39;t get it out of my head. It had me feeling a ton of
emotions rarely emoted from TV. If you don&#39;t like swearing (I don&#39;t and
it&#39;s the one thing that I hated about the series) don&#39;t watch, because
there is a lot of it. I think the F-word is overused. But if this
doesn&#39;t bother you, you&#39;ll love the series. It truly is my only
complaint. The story telling is great, the characters are great and it
seems very real. I can&#39;t speak for more than Season 1, but this is in
my top 5 all time favorite TV shows.
