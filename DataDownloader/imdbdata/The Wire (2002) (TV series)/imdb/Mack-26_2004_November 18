This series seemed confusing at first because I saw the 3rd episode of
the 1st season at first. Thankfully HBO repeated the first three
episodes which have had me hooked ever since. This show forces the
viewer to invest in each character good or bad. It is an investment
that has paid off ten fold. This is the best show on television because
it takes the time to tell stories from every perspective. It does not
choose sides whether its the police or the drug dealers, the
politicians, or the renegade. Each side has their good and bad, their
black, white and even gray aspects. Too bad some are not brave enough
to put this drama in the spotlight. Even with brave writing, acting,
direction, and forethought may never garner the full attention it
deserves. There will be an end to this series. I think letting it last
for a protracted length of time or spinning it off and diluting it ala
CSI would not do the ensemble justice. It's a wonderful story and I
will continue to enjoy the ride.
