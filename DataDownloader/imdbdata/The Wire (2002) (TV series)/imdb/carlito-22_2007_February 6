Like an all time classic album, it takes a little while to get into.
After 4 or 5 episodes your hooked, like a drug fiend hunting red-tops.
You start to consume more and more of the wire, maybe skipping work,
playing less with the kids, leaving the housework. After four gruelling
seasons it spits you back out, but your sitting alone, rocking back and
forth wanting more, waiting for the re-up. Lost and 24 are ruined
forever, they cant come close. Now you call your kids youngns, and your
constantly reaching for your whistle........<br /><br />In Season 5 of the Sopranos, where the opening scene in the first
episode mirrors the last scene of the series, I thought TV couldn&#39;t
possibly get any better.<br /><br />I was wrong.
