When a series is as widely praised as &#39;The Wire&#39;, it might be useful
(from a British perspective) to compare it with our own top cop shows.
And in terms of strength of characterisation, it gets only a middling
mark. The characters are all strong, but you can never altogether
escape the sense that they&#39;ve been designed to fill a role, and some of
the dialogue is just a little too crisp for real life. Watch my own
favourite police show, &#39;The Cops&#39;, and you&#39;ll see how, for all &#39;The
Wire&#39;s much-feted realism, there&#39;s still a faint coating of gloss on
the grime; and no single character is as interesting (or as
well-played) as Jayne Tennyson in &#39;Prime Suspect&#39;. But this does not
mean that &#39;The Wire&#39; does not deserve praise. &#39;Prime Suspect&#39;, in spite
of pretending to be a police procedural, in fact used all the usual
hackneyed plot devices of televisual thrillers. &#39;The Wire&#39;, by
contrast, tells a highly plausible story, and maintaining this single
story over 13 hours without the slightest resort to melodramatic clich&eacute;
is a fine achievement. The program also deserves credit for attempting,
within the scope of fiction, to seriously explore the dreadful state of
America&#39;s neglected, and often ignored, underbelly. This makes &#39;The
Wire&#39; a rare, and serious, program; but also a fine drama whose tension
mounts if you&#39;re prepared to wait for it.
