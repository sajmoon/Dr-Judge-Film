Well this is the first time I felt the need to write a review. If not
because of the lack of interest the show has received here in Europe,
then just to add to the pile of praise it has already received. Let me
tell you, HBO has delivered another masterpiece.<br /><br />Having watched all seasons in quite a short time, I understand the
-relatively- poor ratings it got in it&#x27;s first season. The time slot
wasn&#x27;t right, and -to be honest- it gets off to a slow start. The
quality and promise are there, but the pace of the show&#x27;s first few
episodes is quite slow compared to other major series. And this is
where I thank whatever supreme being there might be for the existence
of a network like HBO. They gave the show time to grow, and to grow on
it&#x27;s viewers. And let me assure you, when you start watching it, that&#x27;s
exactly what it&#x27;ll do. <br /><br />One of the strong points of the Wire however, isn&#x27;t a bunch of
sympathetic characters that&#x27;ll grow on you and make you get involved.
When you&#x27;re done watching everything, it&#x27;s the grim, in-your-face
representation of life in Baltimore that will have got you hooked. <br /><br />Each season revolves around a certain aspect of crime in the city,
ranging from drug dealers to politics to journalism and everything in
between. And despite these changing themes, the show manages to keep
the main characters involved in a believable way. Which is quite an
accomplishment in itself in my opinion.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t want to give away any spoilers, so I&#x27;ll just say this; I have
never watched a show before that has been this ambitious in portraying
a single city by themes regarding crime, the workings of the law,
journalism, politics and the judicial system. This ambition is amazing
in itself. The extraordinary thing is; they succeeded in every single
aspect of it. This show will leave you stupefied and begging for more.
I know that&#x27;s what it did to me.
