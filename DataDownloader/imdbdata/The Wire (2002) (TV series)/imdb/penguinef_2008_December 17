I started watching &quot;Gran Torino&quot; starring Clint Eastwood but left in a
huff 30 minutes in because its inner city characters were laughably
simplistic compared to the twisting, wonderfully nuanced lives in &quot;The
Wire&quot;. Only after watching the Eastwood flick did I realize what a rare
accomplishment Simon et al. have achieved - characters who aren&#39;t
redeemed or martyred when they sacrifice something or do good things,
the small heroics (and the big screwups) that go unnoticed, the
interlocking pieces of a community or organization that sustain or fail
to address problems. I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll be experiencing this irritation
at such films until David Simon&#39;s next project arrives. I&#39;ll read books
in the meantime.
