I know, I know, I&#x27;m a total dinosaur. I&#x27;ve heard abut the phenomenon
that is &#x22;The Wire&#x22; for some time now but have only got round to
watching the first series on DVD now. But my god what a show! I can
only say that the rave reviews that this show has received are more
than justified. It is quite brilliant. The acting is superb, without
exception. The direction is taut and crisp. The story lines are
superbly written and draw you in inexorably. You can&#x27;t watch just one
episode of The Wire, you have to watch at least two or three at a time.
If you are a lover of TV and movies and haven&#x27;t watched this yet,
please PLEASE do! It is quite simply jaw-droppingly excellent. This is
how TV should be, and it is so good to know that it can still be done.
It is quite clear that huge effort has gone into this series, and it is
massively satisfying to watch. This is one show where you can believe
the hype. There are no slow bits, no bits that you will fast-forward
through, you will be gripped by every single second. Hell, you&#x27;ll need
to be in case you miss a plot detail of such excruciating subtlety that
you&#x27;ll cry that you missed it first time round! Sorry, I know I&#x27;m
gushing like a fanboy but The Wire really is that good. It restores my
faith in TV execs when I watch something like this. The best thing is,
I&#x27;m only half-way through series 1 so I&#x27;ve got tons more to look
forward to!
