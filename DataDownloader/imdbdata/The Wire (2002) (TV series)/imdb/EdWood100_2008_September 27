When The Wire lights up on my TV screen within moments I am super-
glued to the armchair in which I sit. Watching six episodes
back-to-back (season two, as I recall) may seem obsessive, but this was
never intended to be an episodic experience. It is only that way out of
necessity. What we have here is a feature film over sixty hours long.
The peerless quality of both writing and acting raises the bar so high
that other shows in the genre will forever be judged against it.
Perhaps only The Soprano&#39;s comes close. Like medals for bravery, if
Oscars or Emmys were awarded for random acts of brilliant human
endeavour, The Wire would walk away with a sack full.
