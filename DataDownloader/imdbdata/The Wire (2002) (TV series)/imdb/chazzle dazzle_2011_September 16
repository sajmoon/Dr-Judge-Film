Those who herald the show say it pushes the limits and provides a sense
of realism that other cop dramas fail to provide. Don&#x27;t believe them
for a second. Every character has a huge back story with a mountain of
personal problems to provide filler when the case hits a road block.
Court proceedings are way out of line while uncovering the criminal
conspiracies show at least some promise. Elements of surprise and
adrenaline are entertaining but the plot tends to slow down and then be
filled with everyone&#x27;s face-palming personal problems. There is also
plenty of loose ends on character development, like when Rawls is shown
in a gay bar and nothing was said/done afterwords. The plot lines
within the &#x22;streets&#x22; are interesting but all in all it doesn&#x27;t have
much separation from a typical, mainstream, quick buck cop drama. It&#x27;s
decent at best, but take a look if this is your kind of genre.
