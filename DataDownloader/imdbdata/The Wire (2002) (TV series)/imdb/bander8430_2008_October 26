The Wire is without doubt one of the best pieces of television ever
made. It has the gritty realism not afforded to most American shows
because it was broadcast on H.B.O. The plots are slowly drawn out, but
in such a way that they keep you enthralled throughout all five series.
The acting in the show is also outstanding, it is a great shame that
none of the main actors (specifically McNulty, Lester, Bunk and
Stringer) have gone on to bigger and better things. David Simon has
truly created on of the most realistic television shows ever. With all
of the detail that is poured into each and every character it does make
you believe that you live in West Baltimore. However, the only qualms I
would have with Mr Simon are the deaths of the two best characters on
the show, Omar and Stringer. I was distraught when they both died. A
crime beyond reckoning that this show did not receive more credit from
the TV and film community, and also that it finished prematurely. I
believe that it could have gone on for at least another series.
Overall, fabulously well constructed and a recommendation for any lover
of great TV. It&#39;s a shame the scale is only out of 10!
