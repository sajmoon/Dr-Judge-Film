So much has been spoken about The Wire&#39;s challenging &quot;visual novel&quot;
style and deliberate pace that the show&#39;s abundance of grade A,
straightforward entertainment is often overlooked. For a series whose
heart and soul is rooted in realism and journalistic detail, The Wire
has actually mastered cinematic conventions, whether it&#39;s the show&#39;s
effortless sense of humor, the expertly crafted thrills derived from
&quot;cat-and-mouse&quot; dynamics or the endlessly stylish stick ups of Omar
Little. And all of that is important to note, because without drawing
the audience in, the show&#39;s searing themes and atypical goals wouldn&#39;t
hit as hard as they do.<br /><br />There are so many moments where the show&#39;s immediate pleasures seem to
almost trick you into thinking that there will be a satisfying ending
to wrap everything up. But no matter how hopeful things get, there&#39;s
never any escape from the show&#39;s inherent sense of classically rooted
Greek tragedy. There are no happy endings, there are no heroes or
villains and plot lines often end with very little resolution. The only
constants are the gods (the corrupt systems of order; &quot;The Game,&quot; so to
speak) and the inevitability of their design. Every character
introduced chooses to either play by the rules or become a victim.<br /><br />Now, there&#39;s no doubt that Greek Tragedies are one of the oldest
storytelling formats and that many dramas have already pondered upon
the destructive relationships between and within modern American
institutions. But very few works of art have seamlessly fused both and
none of them have done so with as much confidence, resonance, ambition
and realistic, in-depth, examination, as The Wire. No matter what
aspect you wish to explore; the working class, the drug subculture,
police forces, school systems, politics, journalism, or almost any
other major force of power or source of downfall in a capitalist
society; the writers and cast of the show have done the research,
pinpointed the probable problems, and embedded a vital sense of drama,
perfect pacing and brilliant, almost mythological, characterizations.<br /><br />The result is a masterpiece; a series of 5 finely crafted, concise and
powerful theses, each contributing to a near-flawless whole that,
hopefully, will become aknowledged, not only as one of the most vital
commentaries on inner-city America of our time, but also as one of the
greatest works of fiction ever made.
