I saw all 50 episodes, a bit more than 50 hours of the Wire in the last
10 days... I think this tells something about how addictive or how good
this show is. I have my taste when it comes to movies and shows, and I
think I can distinguish between those films and shows that changed the
world of cinema and TV and those that didn&#39;t. I can only be compare the
Wire to films like Stalker, 2001, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter and
so on.<br /><br />Everything in the show smells like reality, there are no melodramas.
All the characters live and unlike in any series, they change during
the episodes. Every one of them is dirty, even if they think they are
on the good side. There is no good side here anyway, no-one even knows
whats right or wrong. The characters make wrong decisions, the
governing system is full of incapable idiots, the police can&#39;t solve
the crime puzzles, the politicians don&#39;t care about the people,
everything in the higher ranks is about money, power, defending the
Status Quo. And the people are sucked by their environment, most of the
main characters have no choice of governing their own lives. How could
this happen? How did they manage to bring life to an honest TV series
in America? This TV series has many layers. It&#39;s not just a crime
series, it shows the dirt that you normally don&#39;t want too see even if
you know it&#39;s there. And it also reflects on problems that cannot be
tied to one city only. Ethics, social problems, general problems with
reasoning...<br /><br />The Baltimore of this TV series is the mirror of all cities in the
world, and can also be a mirror of a Lot of things. It&#39;s allegoric in a
lot of ways. It is a symbol of our lives, our reasoning, our
incapability of solving our problems, our incapability of finding the
truth, a symbol of efforts that are purposeless. But most all, it is a
symbol of our failures.
