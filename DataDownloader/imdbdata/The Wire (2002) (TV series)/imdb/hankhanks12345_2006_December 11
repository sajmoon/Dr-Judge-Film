Yes, this is one of the truly great shows in TV history, just like
people have been saying on this board.<br /><br />To people who haven&#39;t seen it before, however, a word of caution before
you dive in. It&#39;s not that fast out of the gate. Season 1 starts slow,
builds up the characters, and sketches out the various plot lines. So
don&#39;t pop in the first DVD and expect fireworks from episode 1.<br /><br />A friend recommended this show to me a few years ago and when I first
started watching, I said, &quot;I don&#39;t know about this...&quot; But I kept
watching and found that within a few episodes I was pretty much hooked.<br /><br />Also, I would say that each season gets better than the last, with the
most recent one (Season 4 aired its finale last night) a true
achievement. I&#39;m not a cop and I&#39;m not a drug dealer (nor am I a
politician or teacher, other jobs that the show focuses on), so I guess
I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s as accurate as they say - but it certainly
feels accurate based on the way I&#39;d expect human nature to play out in
those jobs.
