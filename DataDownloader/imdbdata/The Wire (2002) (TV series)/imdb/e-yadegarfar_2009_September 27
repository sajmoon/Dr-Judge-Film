I believe this title deserves a 10 because it for one draws the
audience in so much that before they know it, they become addicted. The
depiction of a system from more than 1 point of view just brings is
intriguing.<br /><br />There, until now at least hasn&#x27;t been a TV series around that can run
for five seasons without losing the interest of their loyal fans,
though they might just watch it.<br /><br />The writers of this show must have been put more work into the seasons
which are at most 13 episodes than most of the cop series we see
nowadays without predictive loose ends at the end of seasons which
makes you think &#x22;oh i&#x27;m gonna guess whats happening next&#x22;, what it does
to you, is that it makes sure your back in your seat asap playing the
next season.<br /><br />The acting is a good all round acting with some really shining, such as
that of Clarke Peters, Dominic West and Sonja Sohn.<br /><br />This would always be on my recommendation list if i&#x27;m to do it any
justice.<br /><br />Enjoy
