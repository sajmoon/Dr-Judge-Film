I implore you if you haven&#39;t seen this show go buy the DVD boxsets you
will thank me. The direction, the writing, the acting every factor of
this show is 100% flawless. After watching seasons 1-3 you will feel as
if you&#39;ve read a brilliant novel. The slow burning show is so realistic
and moving it touches upon universal themes in so many ways it will
leave you stunned, fans of the show will know what I&#39;m talking about.
I&#39;ve said my piece now go watch this show from season 1. Warning: If
you like TV like the shield and CSI even the sopranos this may change
how you look at them god knows it ruined most TV for me making
everything seem mediocre.
