I just finished the last season of this jewel. I am still in awe.
Didn&#x27;t thought that a TV drama could go so deep in the problems that
affect our modern societies. The scope is huge, the acting is amazing,
scrip and direction faultless. What can I see this story will haunt me
for ever. The streets of Baltimore are a microcosm of the problems that
particularly affect contemporary urban societies in the United States
but can be extrapolated to every big city: education,police ,drugs, the
media, justice, politics,...... Filmed in a &#x22;verite&#x22; style, it&#x27;s like
being inside the story and not looking it from outside as a passive
spectator. It ain&#x27;t get more real than that.....
