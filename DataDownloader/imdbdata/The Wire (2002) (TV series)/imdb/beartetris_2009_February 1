I only started watching The Wire after the fifth season had ended but I
had been put under a lot of pressure from friends and reviews I&#39;d read
that basically said &#39;If you don&#39;t watch this you may as well be dead&#39;.
So I guess expectations were pretty high.<br /><br />But almost every positive thing said about The Wire is undeniably true:
Great acting, great writing, great direction, meticulously realistic,
immersive, interesting + relevant story, outstanding characterisation.
It is like a great novel, it is unique and it is a masterpiece. Even
phrases like &#39;it works on so many levels&#39;, which under any other
circumstances would make you an immediate hate figure in my eyes,
genuinely applies to The Wire.<br /><br />The thing that got me the most was the characters. While other shows
can match it in terms of depth, The Wire instills this level of
characterisation through the entire cast (which is pretty substantial)
and somehow manages to keep it consistent over all five seasons.<br /><br />The only disadvantage of watching The Wire (apart from that it can get
crazily addictive) is that no other show can match it. Probably the
best compliment I can give it is that before I started watching I had
just finished &#39;The West Wing&#39;, and it seems strange to me that I once
thought that was the greatest show on television.
