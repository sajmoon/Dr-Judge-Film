I have read all the hype and been told by many that this show is a
&#x22;must see&#x22; but after watching the first ten episodes I am totally
underwhelmed. First off, I hated all the characters. Not one redeeming
character at all. The acting was wooden and predictable as was much of
the character development. The characters were also far too clich&#xE9;d
even down to a lesbian black cop. I also had difficulty understanding
much of the dialog and what I could understand was banal and childish.
Real people don&#x27;t talk this way and if you believe they do then in all
probability you watch far too much TV.<br /><br />There are much better TV crime series around.
