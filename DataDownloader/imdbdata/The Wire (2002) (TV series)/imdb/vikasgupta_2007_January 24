2007_January 24 
This is absolutely the best show that I&#39;ve ever seen, bar none. Law and
Order and the like are a joke in front of this. In fact, now when I
watch shows in different genres (like 24 or even Star Trek), I can&#39;t
help but think how contrived the series of events and even the
characters are in those shows. The depth of the writing and acting just
doesn&#39;t compare.<br /><br />The Wire also easily trumps any motion picture I&#39;ve ever seen in it&#39;s
ability to capture the good and bad of humanity in the world of today,
without marginalizing or telling only one side of the story. I really
wish I could meet the actors who play the multi-dimensional characters
of the wire, especially the outstanding child actors in season 4. I can
honestly say I&#39;d rather spend an hour talking to Dominick West, who
plays Jimmy McNulty, than a big time actor like Brad Pitt.<br /><br />By the way, I got to say that the first two reviews posted here are an
insult to the fine writing, acting, and directing and should be
stricken from the record. And to those who have a problem with the
swearing, for god&#39;s sakes this is real life they are trying to depict,
not some PG-rated Disney version. Everywhere I&#39;ve ever been and worked,
people swear and express themselves rather colorfully. I grew up in a
not-so-good neighborhood in the suburbs of New Orleans, and although I
didn&#39;t see anything like this first hand, nothing about this show
strikes me as contrived or over-dramatic. I can only imagine how things
work in police stations and on the corners of an ailing city like
Baltimore.<br /><br />So, kudos to Simon and company for capturing real life and real drama
on the small screen. Kudos to those people who have been spreading the
word about the Wire to friends and family. Kudos to the kind folks
hosting the torrent for making a show of this caliber available to
people sans HBO. I just wish I could pay the cost of admission back
some how ... I know! I&#39;ll buy the entire series boxed set after season
5 (which will hopefully be on one Blu-ray disc!).<br /><br />In summary, WATCH THIS SHOW (and don&#39;t get discouraged after the first
episode or two -- keep watching and trust me, you&#39;ll never regret the
time or money investment)
