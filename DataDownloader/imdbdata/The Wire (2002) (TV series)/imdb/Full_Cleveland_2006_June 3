Like a lot of people, I had watched a couple of random episodes on HBO
and thought of &quot;The Wire&quot; as a pretty good, but not great, show. A
couple weeks ago however, I saw the first season at Blockbuster, and
started watching from the beginning, which greatly altered my opinion.<br /><br />I&#39;ve read a lot of rave reviews about &quot;The Shield&quot;, but I&#39;ve never
really warmed up to that show. &quot;The Shield&quot; often wallows in gratuitous
sleaze and frat boy humor which doesn&#39;t do much for me. Plus, Vic and
his amorality make him a hard character to sympathize with. I sometimes
wish they&#39;d just get the goods on the SOB and lock him up.<br /><br />On the other hand, McNulty and associates may be cynical, but they&#39;re
still professionals that stay as focused on the job - as the shows
stays focused on the plot, which is its greatest strength. There aren&#39;t
a lot of side trips into the personal lives of the characters besides
McNulty, and those are mercifully kept to a minimum. If there&#39;s one
clich&eacute; on this show that bugs me, its the obligatory troublesome
ex-wife. I&#39;ve seen this character too much, and it only bogs the show
down. Other than this small flaw, the show is addictive and endlessly
fascinating. Watching the drug dealers, you really feel you&#39;re down in
the hole with the devil. Guys like Stringer and Omar are truly scary
people.<br /><br />For my money, the best cop show I&#39;d previously seen was Season 1 (and
the early part of Season 2) of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. These were the episodes
with David Caruso and Amy Brenneman. But I&#39;ll probably give the edge to
Season 1 of &quot;The Wire&quot;, based on what feels to me like a more realistic
portrayal of life on the streets.<br /><br />For what it&#39;s worth, I would not rate this show quite as high as &quot;The
Sopranos&quot; as a DVD purchase. Because &quot;The Wire&quot; is so plot driven, with
an immense story arc, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to watch it over again for
a while, and it&#39;s not the kind of show where you&#39;d pick out one or two
episodes to fill a couple hours. Nor does it have the humor or
symbolism that makes me want to watch almost any episode of &quot;The
Sopranos&quot; several times.<br /><br />Those small criticisms aside, this is a terrific, intelligent show and
I highly recommend it.
