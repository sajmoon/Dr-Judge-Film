Even by the standards that HBO have set The Wire is a class above them
all. This is the best drama that has ever been committed to film.<br /><br />I&#39;ve watched the first 3 seasons of the show, and I find it impossible
to articulate how great this show is without resorting to words like
incredible, amazing, fantastic, great. In fact they don&#39;t have a word
to describe what has been achieved in the creation of The Wire.<br /><br />First this show is different to anything else you might have seen. This
has real substance, and an intelligence that you don&#39;t see on film or
TV, or in the vast majority of books.<br /><br />The Wire revolves around the drugs trade in the city of Baltimore, the
crime that goes with it, and the various characters that make their
living dealing with it. Every character has a depth that is sadly
missing from most TV shows. The cops ain&#39;t always good, the drug
associates ain&#39;t always bad, and the politicians are sometimes
conflicted about being self serving weasels. I&#39;ve found the show has
more to do with the politics of life and the chains of command that are
associated with that rather than crime itself.<br /><br />Let me break it down for you.<br /><br />THE WRITING: American TV shows always have great writing but this is
different. The writing in a lot of their shows can hook you quite
easily while it pursues the McGuffin as Hitchcock used to call it. It&#39;s
like having a Big Mac. Great while your watching it but it doesn&#39;t fill
you when walk away. But at the end of every season of The Wire you will
walk away fully satisfied, and you will walk away educated. It is that
good. Everyone remarks that it&#39;s like a great novel, and that was the
first impression I got as I sat through the 1st Season. The
intelligence of the show will also surprise you, and I think that the
1st season in particular is a valuable education in politics. <br /><br />THE CAST AND ACTING: It&#39;s just an incredible job on the casting. So
many great and varied parts have been filled by great actors who have
brought a lot of depth and originality to their characters. Also, this
is the only show I&#39;ve seen where the majority of the actors, because
it&#39;s set in West Baltimore, are black. I personally love the job that
casting directors have, and if I was a casting director I&#39;d be
committing a lot of the faces from The Wire to memory.<br /><br />DIRECTION AND CINEMATOGRAPHY: This is an area of The Wire where you
don&#39;t notice the great work that&#39;s been done, because it&#39;s not
intrusive. There are no camera shots just to show off, but every now
and then you do notice some camera work and cinematography and you just
go wow. In particular I&#39;m thinking of some of the shots near the end of
Season 3 that take place in the building where the construction work is
constantly being delayed. The only time the show uses a montage is at
the end of every season and this is a work of art, particularly the 1st
Season&#39;s montage which is set to a great song.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK: The title track is a great song and they choose different
cover versions of the song for each season. The cover for the first
season being the best so far in my opinion. David Simon noted that they
never use any music to drive the emotional power of any scene, and they
only use music if it&#39;s coming from a source within a scene such as a
car radio. But any music they do use has been chosen very well.<br /><br />Now, in life we only have a limited time to spend, and to spend that
time having the equivalent of a 24 hour full season Big Mac would be a
waste of it. Instead you could watch a full season of The Wire in 12 or
13 hours be ecstatically entertained, get a free education and be fully
satisfied when that montage kicks in at the end of a season.<br /><br />Watch The Wire.
