2008_March 29 
I am 39 years old and honestly can say THE WIRE is the best show I have
EVER watched on television. Admittedly, I am not half the TV junkie as
some of my friends but I can tell you this: NOTHING comes close and in
my opinion, this show is a MUST SEE. I never even heard of the show
until I chanced upon several very positive critical reviews of it in
some mens magazines. On a hunch and a whim, I immediately joined
NETFLIX and proceeded to watch all 4 seasons in 3 weeks time. Please,
do yourself a favor, and do the same thing. I am NOT endorsing NETFLIX,
I am just saying whatever method you choose to acquire the series, you
MUST start at EPISODE 1, SEASON 1 and I DEFY you not to finish the
entire anthology.
