I&#39;ve just finished the final season of The Wire, and it&#39;s a definite
must-see. If you&#39;ve been following the series from the beginning then
you know how brilliantly gripping it is in it&#39;s depiction of the battle
against crime and drugs in inner-city Baltimore. Of course, watching
this final season is not an easy experience, as one&#39;s love for this
show makes you apprehensive to reach the end because you love these
characters and their stories, but alas, all good things must come to an
end.<br /><br />Many of the main characters face some tough decisions this time around,
most notably Jimmy McNulty. With the case against Marlo grinding to a
halt due to budget cuts in the police department, McNulty makes a
life-altering decision that affects almost every single character
before the end of the final episode. And his choice, while having
far-reaching consequences for all involved, will also make you think
about what you would have done in his situation.<br /><br />A new thread introduced in this season is the inclusion of new
characters at The Baltimore Sun, a newspaper that becomes involved with
almost all the major plot lines. It also shines a light on how media
portrays sensationalism and spin (positive or negative) in order to
fulfill the bottom line, namely selling newspapers.<br /><br />Of course, all your favourites are back as well, Omar; Bunk; Carver;
Senator Clay Davis and Bubbles, to name a few. And you can rest assured
that every single plot line started at the beginning of the show gets
resolved, although not everyone gets a happy ending. Which is honestly
indicative of the brutally tough &quot;life on the streets&quot;.<br /><br />This season still features the trademark sarcastic wit (especially
between McNulty and Bunk), as well as some tender yet heartbreaking
moments that will stay in your thoughts for days afterward. This was a
ground-breaking show, which told a side of life many of us have never
seen on television. Absolutely brilliant!
