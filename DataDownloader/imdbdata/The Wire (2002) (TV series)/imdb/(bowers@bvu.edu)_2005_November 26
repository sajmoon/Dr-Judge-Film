The great thing about The Wire -and there are many great things about
the series -is how it completely turns the genre of the police
procedural on its head. While most police/crime shows serve the
function to reinforce the notion that, despite challenges and
imperfections, our criminal justice systems and rule of law really
work. The Wire, however, shows how all of us, on both sides of the law,
are equally trapped by forces (Global Capitalism, Corruption,
Racism...) much larger than any individual. There is always resistance
and struggle- sometimes heroic, but mostly futile- and morality can be
found on both sides of the street, along with corruption, blind
self-interest, and mindless bureaucracy.<br /><br />Not only is the show brilliantly realistic in portraying the details of
inner city police work and life on the street, it is chillingly
accurate in depicting the catastrophic breakdown of the social systems
we were all raised to believe in.<br /><br />You won't find any pat answers here - nor will you find satisfyingly
escapist drama either. To say this is the best show ever on television
is to set the bar too low. The Wire is among the most intelligent work
to come out of Hollywood in decades.
