Having just seen the fifth and final season of The Wire, I have to
agree with the vast majority of comments that this is simply the most
compelling, sophisticated and realistic programme on television about
America and the decline of an American city. More a novel, with slow
burning story arcs and a vast ensemble of textured characters, it was
an unapologetic portrayal of drugs, corruption, justice, education and
the media at a local level. Even a subject as simply as office politics
was explored with honesty and occasional humour. <br /><br />It also challenged the audience to change the conventional approach to
viewing television: plot lines were not neatly presented, and threads
continued for the entire five series. Where most shows wrap up their
issues in 45 minutes or less, The Wire forced viewers to remember and
reflect on subjects over the entire show. Characters moved in and out
of focus, and at times The Wire relied heavily on young actors. <br /><br />I am not sure if the reason for its lack of mainstream popularity was
because of its thought provoking subject matter, its relatively unknown
(and largely black) cast, or because it demanded a dedication from its
audience beyond traditionally programming. Certainly, in some countries
outside the US, you could barely find it being screened (I relied on
buying the dvds). But it&#39;s great that when people have found it, they
have generally raved: it deserves any and all the acclaim it can
muster.
