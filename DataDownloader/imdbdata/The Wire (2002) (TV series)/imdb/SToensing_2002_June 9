This show is HBO's first attempt at the &quot;Police Drama&quot; genre. Set in the
projects of Baltimore's west side, The Wire tells the story of the drug
dealers who inhabit the projects, and the police who are trying to stop
them. This show comes off well. The story lines are fast paced and
believable, the actors, several of which have had roles in other HBO
series,
make for an interesting combination of personalities and help make this
show
both engrossing and addictive.  David Simon, the creator has previously
written successful television shows for both HBO (The Corner) and Network
Television (Homicide: Life on the Street). All in all this is another
fantastic series from HBO.
