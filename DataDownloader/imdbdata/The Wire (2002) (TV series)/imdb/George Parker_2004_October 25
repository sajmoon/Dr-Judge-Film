HBO's &quot;The Wire&quot;, another ground breaking TV crime series from David
Simon who grandfathered &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street&quot;, raises the bar
for crime dramas by dedicating a whole season (13 episodes) to a single
story with unparalleled realism. Telling of a motley bunch of
detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which
supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first
year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street
punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and
evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their
humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare
with episodic ups and downs, &quot;The Wire&quot; is one long drama about people
which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting. For realists
only, this series will require some viewer patience while the
complexities of the plot and the characters are developed. One of a
kind...so far. (A)
