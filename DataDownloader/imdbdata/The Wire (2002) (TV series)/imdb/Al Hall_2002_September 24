For someone that isn't into the inter city 'drug' scene that wants to
understand how 'the system' works The Wire is a great series.  Drug
Dealer/city politics 101.  The so called 'good guys' and the 'bad guys' all
have an 'agenda' and everyone is part of the 'food chain' that starts with
the kids selling drugs in the projects and ends at the highest level of city
government.  As the series progresses we move up the food chain, learn how
each level works and how each depends on the level below.  Drugs is the glue
that keeps the system together and money is the fuel that powers the entire
system.<br /><br />The acting is top notch and blows away all competition in the genre.  Here
is hoping for season two as The Wire is right up there with The Sopranos,
Six Feet Under, in interesting story line, exquisite acting, interesting
characters, and creativeness.<br /><br />Lastly, the actor who plays Omar, Michael K. Williams, is absolutely great! 
Why haven't we seen this actor before? Michael dominates every scene he is
in.
