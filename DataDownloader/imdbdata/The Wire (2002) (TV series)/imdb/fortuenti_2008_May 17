I have never seen a movie or TV program with such high viewer ratings
and enthusiastic criticism before but, after having viewed Season 1 and
Disc One of Season 2, I am not at all surprised&#151;for the majority of
those before me reflect my sentiments exactly and I still have many
more episodes to watch. I am looking forward now with even greater
anticipation than before.<br /><br />I learned of this amazing series by way of an article by its writers
which was, essentially, a scathing diatribe against America&#39;s decades
long failed &quot;War on Drugs&quot; and the abject racism and corruption which
constitutes its very essence:<br /><br />http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1719872,00.html<br /><br />After reading the above, I immediately ordered from Netflix and the
following episodes are at the top of my queue. I can only imagine the
anxiety of having to wait for each as they were originally released
versus the luxury of having them come in on DVD!<br /><br />I hope that this series has caused&#151;and will continue to cause&#151;people to
change their way of thinking about this disastrous public policy which
makes alcohol Prohibition seem quaint and nostalgic by comparison but,
tragically, has demonstrated far greater staying power than the 18th
Amendment.<br /><br />All the US has to show for its drug policy are losses of once-sacred
civil liberties and rights to privacy, wasted billion$, corrupt
law-enforcement and judicial systems, status as &quot;World&#39;s #1 Jailer,&quot;
countless lives ruined by criminal records, countless preventable
overdose and AIDS-related deaths, and more. There were good reasons
that former D.A., and later Mayor of Baltimore, Kurt Schmoke became a
highly visible and vocal opponent of the drug war and those reasons are
masterfully played out in THE WIRE.<br /><br />This series is as addictive as the &quot;rock&quot; that the brothers in the
&#39;hood be slinging on the corners and courtyards of West Baltimore.<br /><br />DRUG PROHIBTION MUST BE REPEALED. WATCH THIS SERIES&#151;for it will likely
change you mind if you disagree.
