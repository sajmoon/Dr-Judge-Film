I played all the first 3 chapters of Resident Evil for so many times
that I can&#39;t count. All first 3 episodes are one of my favorite games
and my favorite kind of genre. I think it&#39;s important for me to say
that for Resident Evil I gave 3 stars. But unlike I did for Resident
Evil, I will not split this comment as a game player and as a non game
player because there&#39;s no need for doing that as the mess has been done
with the first movie and we can&#39;t go back in time.<br /><br />The second chapter of the game starts with Claire Redfield going to
Racoon City in search for her brother disappearance, Chris Redfield,
the character from the first chapter. Also there&#39;s Leon Kennedy which
is coming to Racoon after his admission for the local police
department. Claire and Leon meets each other when both of them were
running away from the zombies attacks. An explosion split themselves,
both go to separate ways to find survivors and a way to call for
rescue. During their search for rescue they discover what happened to
the city, the people, and all the responsibilities of Umbrella Co. over
the happenings. That&#39;s the story of the game.<br /><br />Backing to the movie, Resident Evil ended with Milla Jovovich
discovering the complete caos surrounding Racoon City. The city is
completely destroyed everywhere, there&#39;s no sign of any human being.
She&#39;s alone. The first movie was a huge piece of crap but its end was a
sign that everything could be better in a sequel because its end is a
lot like the way the second chapter of the game starts. I thought they
would start the movie from its prequel finish... but they didn&#39;t. Crap
again.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse, had all the qualities to be a better and
interesting version of Dawn Of The Dead if it had been made over the
original game plot because it also takes over a city fulfilled by
zombies and there&#39;s a complete caos everywhere but with more
interesting characters, but the movie wasted again all the potentials
of the game plot and that&#39;s a shame.<br /><br />Nemesis is quite the same of the game, but at the end of the movie he
saves Alice from the dead, because, you know, at the deep of his heart
there&#39;s a human. Oh, cmon, that&#39;s so dumb!!! Nemesis is the toughest
monster of the series, he destroys everything he touches and there&#39;s no
way to scape if you do not have a rocket launcher because he never dies
with punches or simple bullets, he was made to be a destruction
machine.<br /><br />Milla is worst than ever, and when you think that Milla is the worst
actress of the movie than you&#39;ll be surprised with Sienna Guillory.
Siena is Jill Valentine, it could be fine to have this character if the
plot of either Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse were some
kind faithful to the game plot, but they&#39;re not, so... what the hell
she&#39;s doing there? And Why she&#39;s here using the outfit of the 3rd game?
On the game there&#39;s an explanation for her to be using that outfit,
it&#39;s silly, but still being an explanation, but that outfit on the
movie is bullshit! She&#39;s there and using that outfit just saying
there&#39;s finally an original character in the movie and she needs to
look hot for the audience. And there&#39;s more... Jill Valentine doesn&#39;t
have that personality. She&#39;s fragile but also courageous, she&#39;s not
that kind of kicking ass girl that is shown in the movie. The first
scene where Jill appears is so clich&eacute; and laughable, making all those
choreography with her pistols and shooting perfectly on every zombie.
That&#39;s awful... it&#39;s a scene to impress 8 y.o. kids, and it&#39;s a shame
that this movie is full of scenes like that. The other original
character there is Carlos Oliveira, original but useless for the movie.<br /><br />There&#39;s no way to fix this series... I don&#39;t know who are the people
who enjoyed this movie so much to make the studio work on a 3rd
chapter. I hope some good director take the Resident Evil project
serious someday to redo as it should had be.
