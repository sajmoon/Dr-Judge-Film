Well, awful is just that. I thought Resident Evil 1 was bad. Never in a
million years did i think they would make a second one.<br /><br />Even worst, same actress. In my opinion (and bear in mind its just
that) she is not this kind of actress. Only movie i have no bad remarks
is &quot;5th element&quot;. But then again she plays this fragile little thing
(with only 1 or 2 scenes that she actually fights) which is correct for
that fragile little body of hers.<br /><br />On top of that, in &quot;5th element&quot; you get Bruce &quot;Action Movies&quot; Willis.
With Willis what can possibly go wrong ? He is the main character for a
reason.<br /><br />If the girl that plays Valentine were the main character the movie
would (at least) move up 1 or 2 points.<br /><br />PS : Do not tell me &quot;hey that is just like the game!&quot; If i wanted the
game i would have bought it and not the movie.
