First time director (Witt) who directed Resident Evil: Apocalypse, made
Anderson look a FOOL. This film was shot so much better than the first.
Action sequences were good. Story was horrible (granted Anderson wrote
it, please somebody take away his DGA/WGA cards... please). RE:A was
not what I wanted to see. But it was still a very cleaner looking film.
The Jill Valentine character was HORRIBLE. I'm sorry, I played the
game, and Jill was no badass, rude, unstoppable character. Her facial
expression was the same throughout the entire film and though Anderson
wrote some of the worst dialog I have ever heard, well except for AVP,
oh wait he wrote that one too, she delivered the bad dialog, well
badly. The movie would have been much better if there was no Jill in
the mix. That character kinda killed the whole movie for me. Mila on
the other hand rocked. She has a very big future in the action genre. I
enjoyed the look of the Nemisis, and the zombie dogs looked much better
in this one, as did all the CGI work. If you're a fan of the series go
see it. It's good mindless entertainment and leaves an intriguing
ending th say the least. If part 3 is absent of Anderson it could have
some potential. If you're not a fan of the video games, rent 28 days
later, Dawn/Day of the dead, hell rent Night of the Demons!
