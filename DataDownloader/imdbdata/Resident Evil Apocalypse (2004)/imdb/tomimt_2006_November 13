No plot, no character development, cheesy scares and silly action.
That&#39;s in the nutshell everything, &#39;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#39; has to
offer. The first film was okay, if you could appreciate the comedic
aspect of the film, but RE:A hits the action throttle so far back, that
every scene in it turns either unintentionally funny or just plain
boring.<br /><br />If you are looking for a horror film turn away, as RE:A doesn&#39;t have
slightest bit in common with the genre. It is more of a brainless
action in style of Commando, though you could argue that at least
Commando HAD some kind of a plot thingy in it.<br /><br />This time the film has two babes killing off the deaders, though that
doesn&#39;t matter the slightest in terms of personality or
characterization. They both are more thought than anyone else and all
the other characters are in the movie just to be killed off. Milla
Jovovich makes a return as Alice and the other chick is Jill, played by
Sienna Guillory.<br /><br />Special effects are okay, but far from the greatest ever. In more than
one occasion the CGI is far too noticeable. Music isn&#39;t anything worth
mentioning and neither is the acting, or any of the actors for the
matter, as it all is just so... ordinary.<br /><br />Score: 3/10 Camp score: 3/10
