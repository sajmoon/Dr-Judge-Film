When I finished this movie I thought to myself, who made this movie?
They totally made Resident Evil into Fat Albert. It seriously had no
feeling of the game. I am a HUGE fan of the games. I thought it was
cool to have Nemesis in the movie, but they took advantage of it.They
forgot about the zombies when they introduced Nemesis. They should
really make a movie actually based on one of the games. To me, the
first movie was way better. They made Jill Valentine into a bad ass but
in the game she is not even like that. I am just glad Uwe Boll didn't
do it. Then the movie would have received a 1. I think they should
still make movies based on games but they should make them better. Like
Mortal Kombat. I liked that movie it actually felt like the game. Thanx
for reading this and listening to my opinions.
