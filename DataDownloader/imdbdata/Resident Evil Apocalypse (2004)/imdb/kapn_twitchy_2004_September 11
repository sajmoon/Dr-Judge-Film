Great movie! The massive scores of zombies kept me distracted from the
massive scores of potheads making lame jokes. THAT is a good measure of
a movie nowadays.<br /><br />Seriously, is was a great movie. Better than the first in some ways,
even. There was more action this time around and less psychological
terror, it seems.<br /><br />The camera work and special effects were sort of worse, I thought at
first, but then I put myself in a &quot;video game frame of mind&quot; and it
actually seemed cooler than a movie. The only annoyance was all of the
vague accents from the supporting characters, but it becomes less of a
problem as the film progresses.
