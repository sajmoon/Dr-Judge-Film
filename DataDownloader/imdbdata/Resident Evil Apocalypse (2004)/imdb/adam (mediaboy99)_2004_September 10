Save your money. Watch it when they show it on TV. But have the remote
handy<br /><br />I saw a promo screening last night and was very glad that I didn't
actually fork over thirteen bucks to see it. <br /><br />There is little plot, Terrible dialogue, and almost no character
development. Now I had hoped that this film would be decent. I had fun
watching the first one, not a masterpiece but an enjoyable 2 hrs. I
also spent an afternoon watching helicopters flying around outside my
apt window last year as they shot the bridge scenes. I went in
expecting to be entertained and instead found a predictable action
movie with nothing new to offer. <br /><br />The action scenes were way over the top. often the shots being too dark
and too fast paced to follow the action. there would be a blur on the
screen. some crunching sounds and when it settled down again Millia
Jovovich would be standing over the broken body of whatever it is she
crushed that time. <br /><br />I guess I was hoping for more originality, There were action sequences
that were lifted straight out of other movies. The most memorable to me
was the garbage chute scene in La Femme Nakita. <br /><br />There were a few moments that were fun. For a Torontonian it was kind
of neat to watch my city get trashed. There were a few fun little
moments especially the comic relief of Mike Epps but in all the movie
was a disappointment, and certainly not worth my being woken up at 3 in
the morning by gunfire form the set.
