This sequel was a different type of movie than the first. At no time
was I ever scared of the walking dead. In the previous film the focus
was placed more on these zombies. In this version we saw these
creatures in masses and their details was not captured. What the
director focused on more was on the action shots, some of which I
actually did enjoy. A few effects were very nice and had that 'ooh ahh'
factor, which is the only reason one might opt to see this movie at the
theater. Other than that I don't recommend spending those $9. The story
was very predictable and worse had many cheesy lines. Of course that is
to be expected in an action film, which is what the movie ended up
being. I suppose it more closely relates to its game originator, but if
that's what we wanted we are better off playing the actual game.
