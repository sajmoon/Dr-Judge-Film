I don't get it - how is it that a sequel is as good as the original?
Well, regardless, this is. Milo Jojovich once again rocks as the
awesome fighter of &quot;resident evil.&quot; NOTE: this is no small
accomplishment. I always have to explain how Spock, played by Leonard
Nimoy and 7 of 9, played by Jerry Ryan were brought to life by those
respective actors.<br /><br />Take for example Tuvoc in Start Trek: Voyager, or the lead blonde
detective in &quot;Escape from Mars.&quot; Both of these actors were stiff and
therefore unconvincing. (Perhaps your examples would be different, but
the point is the same - it is the ACTOR who brings the character to
life - not the direction, editing, set, costumes, make-up, etc. - it
all comes down to acting.)<br /><br />Milo Jojovich is a great actress for this part. Utterly convincing in
every detail she commits acts of martial arts that even I, a great
skeptic of females knocking over 200# soldiers - believes. (Another
example is the brunette in this movie who is like Milo's character in
RE I. She is not convincing at all and throws the movie off.) The other
supporting actors fare well in this movie. But let's face it - it's all
Milo.<br /><br />This movie delivers and doesn't disappoint. In fact when it ends they
leave me wanting to see RE 3!<br /><br />9/10 (The 9 is for other things having nothing to do with Milo.)<br /><br />-Zafoid
