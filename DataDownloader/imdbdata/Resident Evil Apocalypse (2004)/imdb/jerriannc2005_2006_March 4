I am totally confused about the graveyard scene. It doesn't fit with
this movie at all. The group is moving through a graveyard, they stop
to rest a minute, decide that Alice isn't going to kill Peyton and that
Jill will if and when it &quot;comes to that&quot;. When all of a sudden,
&quot;people&quot; start emerging from graves. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but
graveyards are for people who are dead. By the looks of most of them,
they had been dead for some time. If they have been dead and not
exposed to the virus, why are they coming back from the dead and trying
to eat these live human beings? I know people that are watching are not
supposed to think of these things, but perhaps I've missed something.
Maybe someone could post what is going on that I may have missed. I
just saw it as a useless fight scene with no connection to the actual
plot. The plot being that the living in Raccoon City were being
infected by the virus, dying and returning to life on some sort of
primal level and trying to feed on what is left of the live human
beings. Where do these already dead people fit in?
