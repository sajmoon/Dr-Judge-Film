apocalypse was what i expected. no better, no worse than the original.
i wasn't surprised when the characters didn't match up perfectly with
the video game's (i.e. nicholai was a pansy, jill was a hardass, WHERE
THE HELL WAS MIKHAIL?!) but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.<br /><br />milla jovovich is hot.<br /><br />what i didn't like was the shaky, blurry, choppy camera work while
filming the zombies. there was none of that in the first. i suppose
they did that to make them look less human. OR they were just lazy with
the make-up this time around. ..also, the ending??<br /><br />good movie. HOORAH
