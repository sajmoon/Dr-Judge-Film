I work at a movie theater. I usually don't pay for movies unless they
only get them at the Galleria (such as foreign or independent films).
Well due to recent theater openings in our area, we didn't get RE2. I
payed to see the movie because not only did I enjoy the first one, but
I love the games. The movie was awesome. Sure, the acting was less than
wonderful with some of the characters but I mean Jill was in the movie!
An Ashford was in the movie! All of the monsters were in the movie
(minus the hunters and spiders). Nemesis even said his line from the
game! There were so many connections to the game, that I was blown
away. This movie is definitely for the gamers!
