I, for one, hated the first film. I found only the film's last few
minutes to be exhilarating. The first film boasted bad CGI effects,
poor make-up effects and it's biggest flaw was that it did not utilize
the scenarios that played out in the ultra successful video games.
That, however, has been corrected in this slam bang sequel. Non-stop
action and the films fast-pace nature helps the viewer forget (or
ignore) the film's weaknesses. And the film's weakness is mainly the
script written by Paul W.S. Anderson. Weak dialog and a flimsy story
are certainly things that may completely annoy a less-forgiving viewer.
The film's direction by Alexander Witt is fair but flawed. I, for one,
hate the use of slow motion and sped up frames that are consistently
used in today's movies. However, with a bigger budget that improved the
CGI and makeup, made it possible to make RE: Apocalypse an entertaining
way of spending an evening. Just don't over-analyze the film and watch
it for what it is. A 'leave your brain at the door' horror/action film.
