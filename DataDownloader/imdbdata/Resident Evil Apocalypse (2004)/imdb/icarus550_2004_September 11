First off I must say that I am rather disappointed in IMDb for
catergorizing this movie as Horror and Thriller, which it most
certainly is neither. However, it also lists it as Action and Sci-Fi
which it definitely is. <br /><br />If you loved the first movie, you will probably be quite entertained by
this action-packed sequel, though if you were like me and were hoping
for something a little more true to the video game on which it was
based you will certainly be disappointed. Really the only similarities
to the game that I could find where the use of familiar names such as
Umbrella Corp, Racoon City, STARS, etc. The plot progression in RE2 is
even more contrived than that of RE1 and I found most of the action
scenes to be way over-the-top. <br /><br />Although there are plenty of walking-dead in this movie I would hardly
consider it a &quot;zombie flick&quot;. What's missing here is any semblance of
horror or suspense. Really the only suspense comes from when characters
inadvertently sneak up on each other and suddenly grab their shoulder
from behind. I would think with everyone being on edge and ready to
shoot at anything that moves, you would want to be a little more subtle
in getting your teammates attention. I am also baffled by how many
times someone gets bitten. Everyone in the movie is well aware that if
you get bitten by one of them, you will turn into one of them, yet no
one seems to be wearing any protection against that sort of thing. <br /><br />I feel guilty for putting so much money forth to see this type of
cinematic crap (It cost me $15 after ticket, food and drink to see a
matin&eacute;e showing!), further provoking them to blow even more money on
huge explosions and big-budget effects on an inevitable third
installment.<br /><br />If you are a fan of big budget, highly implausible action movies such
as Blade or Van Helsing then by all means drop $10-$20 and go see this.
If you are a fan of zombie flicks, it is still not worth the bother, go
rent Shaun of the Dead instead. If you are a fan of Suspense, Thriller,
Horror movies then go see something else---anything else!
