First the movie is not as good as Resident Evil. One of the best thing
about the first movie is the cool action sequences which at least had
some logic,but here all u see is crappy editing which takes away much
of the enjoyment from the action sequences. I had a feeling the movie
spent more time setting up a sequel rather than giving us a good action
movie.I felt like i watched a teaser trailer for the next movie and
that was not wat i paid for. I was disappointed that a movie with lots
of potential was let down by many corny scenes..well at least some
comic relief was there..But still I'm expecting a sequel to this movie
and wish that was handled better than the first one. Was the director
over-excited while filming the action sequences, i bet he wd have got
confused while filming them and editing them in such a away that it
will be cool only for people who have the capability to visualize lots
of things fast. Overall the movie is watchable especially if u loved
the first one and i loved the way they setup the sequel than the rest
of the movie. The cool background music from the first movie is also
missing.
