This is a sequel to the 2002 movie where the dead become the living
undead in a search for fresh meat. The Umbrella Corp opens their
underground research lab 'the hive,' and they unfortunately let the
virus escape into Raccoon City. The plague moves rapidly, and soon
everyone is infected. Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakens in the Umbrella
Corp's lab connected to tubes. They have been experimenting with the
virus, and it has mutated inside Alice's body giving her extraordinary
powers. Alice leaves the lab and begins to kill the undead as she goes
through the city. Alice rescues a group of survivors who are holed-up
inside a church. They must leave the church and get out of the city,
but the Umbrella Corp has sealed it. Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared
Harris), an Umbrella Corporation scientist, will help Alice and the
others escape the city if they find his daughter Angie (Sophie
Vavaseur). The Umbrella Corporation sends in their secret weapon
code-name Nemesis to see how good he is as a weapon. Nemesis wipes out
the Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.) team. Nemesis's
next target is Alice. The movie will scare you and make you jump out of
your seat several times. The action and fight scenes are very well
done. From the ending, it looks like a third movie is on its way. (Sony
