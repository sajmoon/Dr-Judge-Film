If you enjoyed the game's series of resident evil, don't waste your
time on this title as it has nothing to do with the actual game except
the fact that the Umbrella corp is in there, along with a few of its
creatures. the &quot;REAL&quot; main character(Jill Valentine) gets tossed aside.
there seems to be A lot of fluff and a lot of camp in this movie. Just
someone's idea to make money off of a otherwise decent game title,
which CAPCOM should have never let happen. I watched the first movie
with disappointment, and figured the sequel would get to the main story
that is RESIDENT EVIL. after sitting through the second title i was in
disbelief. people who do not play these games should never be allowed
to make movie titles based on them. its insulting at best.
