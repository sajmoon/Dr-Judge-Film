2005_April 20 
Me and my friend rented Resident Evil: Apocalypse, in early April. I
was expecting a thrilling action with absolutely great special effects
and at least an OK story. After I watched this movie, I realized I was
wrong. Resident Evil 2 is not what I was hoping to be and it just looks
like a 80s trash movie. The actors in this movie are mediocre (except
for Milla Jovovich), the special effects are still cool (Nemesis is
TRASH COOL!!!), but they're not perfect, and the story is almost OK,
but it loses it in itself. The movie was long, considering the final
result of it, and everything that seems to work is just not enough. I'm
placing all my bets on Silent Hill now, to be a great video game based
movie. I'm just disappointed with this film. FINAL GRADE: 5.4/10
