we all saw the first resident evil movie and i personally liked it very
much, it had a good story line, nice visual effects and good music.<br /><br />well, this isent the case with the sequel, sure it follows the
storyline with zombies caused by the t-virus but otherwise its,
compared to the first, a disaster.<br /><br />i counter to 300 clips during a single fight lasting 7min, thats almost
one clip a second, maby I'm getting old but my eyes grew tired of
trying to grasp whats happening each second the view changes, but then
again I'm only 25yo... the storyline doesn't really stick to a story,
more to something like &quot;mutated beautiful girl fights bad monsters,
ugly mutated monster is really good, umbrella corp bad&quot;<br /><br />if you like action and/or epilepsy i recommend this movie, otherwise
stick to the first one.
