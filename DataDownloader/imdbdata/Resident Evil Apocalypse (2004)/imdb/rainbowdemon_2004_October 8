2004_October 8 

After seeing the original Resident Evil, I had great expectations from
the second chapter (of a possible trilogy?). after seeing it I can say
I quite disappointed. Of course, the movie is well done, and I don't
have any complains about the actors and their acting, still - The so
well known plot of some innocent citizens locked up in a city full of
zombies returns again and again and again (but to be honest, this is
the best of all movies with the same plot). <br /><br />While in the first movie you could feel the fear and the thrill, here
you will see some nice action parts but no more. A lot of &quot;bang-bang&quot;
and none of the sophistication from the first movie. This what
disappointed me the most.<br /><br />The ending, which I won't tell of course, was a bit of surprising and
left many questions opened to what happened in the last 5 minutes of
the movie (what led me to the conclusion of making the third, and maybe
the final Resident Evil).
