My cousin and I loved this movie!! We went to see it Thursday and I'd
have to say that we were very pleased with the movie. It had a lot of
suspense and some parts scared the crap out of us. We loved how Milla
Jovovich kicked a$$! My cousin said to me &quot;Isn't she that girl from the
fifth element?&quot; and I said &quot;Yeah, now you see why she kicks a$$!&quot; All
in all we loved the movie and we recommend people to go see it. Some
people think that this movie is bad but don't let that stop you from
going to see the movie and getting your own opinion. I said the movie
'The Village' was bad and said not to go see it. That wasn't my place
to do a thing like that and it's up to you to decide whether the movie
is good or not.
