Okay, when I heard about the first part, I heard that none of the
characters in the game were going to appear, and a lot of fans
complained about it, and I must say, I'm a die hard fan of RE and I
didn't felt that way, because if either Chris, Jill, or other character
appeared i knew that they couldn't die. So i was very happy with this.<br /><br />The first one was more like the first game of RE: atmospheric, creepy
and with good horror, I liked it very much, and when I learned that
Nemesis was the theme of the sequel I was anxious to see it.<br /><br />Now I have seen it, and it applied the same &quot;rules&quot;, while the first
and (a little) the second were horror games, the third, &quot;Nemesis&quot; was
more like a action game, no horror, no suspense, just action. I'm not
saying I didn't liked the game, in fact, it's in my top ten of my list,
but somehow I knew the second RE was going to be like the third game,
and let me say, I wasn't disappointed, it was like seeing the game, the
action, and Jill, who kept me drooling the entire movie, was a very
good addition. So, if you want to see the same story, same characters,
the same thing, then play the game! If you want to see something
different, watch this, you'll be pleased :)
