I liked the first Resident Evil movie. Okay so it didn't really stick
to the games, but it was a good movie... if a lil' pointless. There was
only one thing that pissed me off about it and that was the lack of
zombies.<br /><br />I thought they'd sort this out in the sequel, I mean, c'mon, that's the
main point to the games: ZOMBIES! But no, there were even less zombies
this time 'round. Instead, we have the Nemesis. This guy looked so damn
class in Resident Evil 3 (the game that is), and they've recreated him
here exactly how he looked in the game. This may please fans, but you
just can't take this thing seriously. He just looks... uh... funny,
like something from a Power Rangers episode. <br /><br />But that doesn't matter, 'cause the Nemesis is only in the movie for
about 3 and a half seconds. The rest of the time is spent showing Alice
kicking stuff, jumping through windows and flicking cigarettes at
stuff. I thought that this movie would be a great 'leave your brain at
the door' kinda action movie, but no, it's DUMBER than that.<br /><br />There is no point to the movie at all. Nothing happens. The gang just
walk through the most dangerous places they can find for an hour.
THAT'S IT!<br /><br />Every action movie staple you can think of is here too. This movie
plays like one of those action movie parodies... except... this is all
straight faced. It's hilarious, but not in a good way. Don't even get
me started on the token black guy.<br /><br />If you've seen your fair share of action movies, you'll hate this. It
offers NOTHING new, NOTHING AT ALL! Instead it's just a random mess of
recycled action scenes from other movies. You've seen this before a
million times, trust me.<br /><br />While watching the movie, I just had this image of some Hollywood
big-wig handing a 10 year old a few million dollars and saying &quot;Hey
kid, wanna make a movie&quot;, then he leaves the kid to do whatever the
Hell he wants.<br /><br />POINTLESS, UTTERLY POINTLESS.
