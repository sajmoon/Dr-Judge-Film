The first time I saw &quot;Resident Evil 1&quot; was on cable. At first I thought
it was nothing but a B-grade zombie flick. But, after a couple of more
viewings the story and sci-fi elements got under skin. Not to mention
that I have a thing for Milla (Leeloo) Jovovich. I wound up buying the
DVD, and only then did I realize that the movie was based on a video
game.<br /><br />When I heard about &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; I knew that I would
check it out. Last night I caught the midnite show at a local theatre.
I found RE2 to be one of the best sequels I've ever seen. I enjoyed the
way RE2 picks up right where RE1 left off. This time around there is
still enough gratuitous zombie killing for all, but there was also a
lot of time spent filling in the background story, further developing
the main characters, and setting up what will be, for me, a 'must-see'
third installment of the franchise.
