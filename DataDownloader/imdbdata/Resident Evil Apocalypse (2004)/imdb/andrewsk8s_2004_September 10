RE: Apocalypse is about what I expected, your garden variety sizzling
hot women with guns shooting zombies movie. It won't be one of the top
contenders for the Oscars this year. Just get a big bag of popcorn
extra butter, turn off the brain for awhile, and enjoy! It was a great
movie to cap off the end of the summer season. I had a few minor
logical problems with the (simple) plot. And the
director/cinematographer chose to use that extremely close/blurry
camera, jumpy-cut editing style which seems to be in vogue right now
(see Bourne Supremacy), which made some of the hand-to-hand fighting
difficult and dizzying to follow. I detected an homage or two to other
zombie flicks, but it is hard to tell as this genre is full of classic
clich&eacute;s (by now, everyone knows the &quot;rules&quot; of a zombie movie, just as
everyone knows the &quot;rules&quot; of a vampire film). <br /><br />I liked that the story picked up right where the last one ended i.e.
the scene where Milla Jovovich walks out of the hospital half-clothed
and grabs a shotgun out of a police car in the chaotic ruins of Racoon
City. <br /><br />Sienna Gullory, the other female lead, is mesmerizing on-screen as she
very much looks and acts like a video game character (a super, smokin'
hot video game character BTW). Michelle Rodriguez in the last film did
the tactical commando/gunplay stuff better, IMO, but I'm not
complaining.
