The sequel to &quot;Resident Evil&quot; has come! It makes you be more in the
movie than watching it. Milla Jovovich returns as the deadly Alice.
She's even more enhanced. Which is some I liked for her to be. This
movie didn't bore me at all. And that freak that Alice fought is the
cross of &quot;Alien&quot; and Chatter Cenobite of &quot;Hellraiser&quot;. There was
nothing to miss, even though some of the scenes moved faster than
usual. However, the more you watch the movie, the better you'll
understand it. The credit goes to Capcom games most definitely. They
always make great games, and Screen Gems didn't let the audience down
either. There were more zombies than usual but that doesn't matter, it
made the movie more interesting. And I liked the part where Alice
nearly put the guy's eye out with his own pen. Shows the meaning, &quot;Get
the point?&quot; The news teams were complete idiots, they're giving praise
to the evil corporation, and not the journalist. For shame. They'll
learn the hard way next time, if there is one. If I was in this movie,
I would join Alice, armed to the teeth! Rating 4 out of 5 stars!
