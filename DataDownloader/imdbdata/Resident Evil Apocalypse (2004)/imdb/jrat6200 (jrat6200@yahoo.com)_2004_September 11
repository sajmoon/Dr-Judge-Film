2004_September 11 

I'm sorry, but this movie was really bad. I don't understand how are
these other reviewers giving this movie credit and stating that it is
one the best video game adaptations ever to be put on screen, How?!
These are young teens that think women in tight skirts can save a
movie. DEAD WRONG!! Paul Anderson has now screwed up three franchises
(Alien, Predator, Resident Evil), and he's not even considered the
audience he's making these movies for. The style and impact of his
direction and scriptwriting has decreased so bad that sometimes his
movies become unwatchable (Alien Vs. Predator). Alexander is nothing
but a flunky to Anderson. That's a shame.<br /><br />Alexander Witt helms this movie as his first directorial debut. But,
its a stinker!! Whoever thought filming a movie, calling the set
Raccoon City, and disguising it as Toronto would work. People who live
in that area are probably laughing at this more than I am. This movie
lacked wit and substance. There was really no point in making this
sequel. These movies prove that Hollywood truly is a business about
making money. Apparently Anderson had too much influence on Witt
because his style and direction are very similar. Quick shot editing,
big explosions, a lot of glass breaking, describes this movie. The
camera shots were so bad that it was laughable (worse than Alien Vs.
Predator). The theater audience can attest to that. What's the idea of
using all of these Matrix elements (slow-motion bullets, cheap sound
effects). This is nothing but a big B-movie with a lot of explosions
and fine women. I didn't find nothing wrong with the SFX in the movie.
They got at least something done right!! But, make-up of the Nemesis
monster seemed like I was watching another movie of the Toxic Crusader. <br /><br />The zombies were some of the worst and really took a backseat to
whatever the movie was trying to do. Survival horror is what I think of
when hearing Resident Evil, not martial arts action. There was no
horror factor at all in this movie. It was laughable at the most. The
cast, OMG, the cast!! Mike Epps served no purpose but a comic relief in
this feature. A few laughs are not going to save this one. Oded Fehr's
badass character was decent, but Sienna Guillory in a tight mini-skirt
is unbelievable. Sexy, YES, but not for this movie. Milla, Milla,
Milla. Being sexy on-screen does not save you either. With heightened
superhuman powers and strength, this seemed more like a Saturday
morning cartoon. But, she had to work with what she was given. <br /><br />The first RE at least was paced throughout and had some form of style.
It almost seemed like a four-star movie compared to this one. I regret
paying my $6.00 to the fullest. I went in very skeptical about the
results, and what I received was failure to deliver. Boycotting some of
Hollywood's movies seems logical these days. Being let down by
Hollywood is nothing new. Why the movie was set up for another sequel,
I don't know. This is a disgrace to the video game, and Anderson knows
it. The style was below average, and the gore factor wasn't present.
Dawn of the Dead, both original and the 2004 version, are better
movies.<br /><br />Final Judgment: 1/2/****
