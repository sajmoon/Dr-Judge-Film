Unlike the first movie, the second one is a pure action movie for the
masses. Development of an atmosphere or even worse emotional
development of the characters was completely not considered by the
makers of the movies, on the other hand they easily sacrificed any
piece of story logic for having another cool pose of their main
characters. As a result, the story has holes as large as moon craters
and a development like the shambling of a drunk. The movie beginning is
very artificial and the movie climax very cheesy and wordy. Still, the
movie has quite some nice action scenes and over long distances also
suspense.<br /><br />I can&#39;t really recommend it, the predecessor was a lot more spooky and
original.
