This film is a total disaster in quality.First there is another little
girl who was a used element more times like you can tolerate in horror
genre,and I can not remember one sentence she sad,but maybe she had
some.Two: The Scenery:Sometimes video films has better explosions like
you will see this time.But zombie filled places are not taking too much
attention from me,cause we know what will happen in the next moment,and
the whole film is just a boring second part of a medium quality first
one.This film is absolute forgettable,cause the scenes are under-
acted,and you can not understand,how and why the creators did not
realize this film is not able to theaters ,maybe just video,and DVD-
stores can tolerate this type of &quot;ACTION -SCIENCE -FICTION&quot;But
personally I wish you wait to cable,cause finally this film is not
enough good to rent it.
