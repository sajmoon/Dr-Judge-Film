Rating: * (out of *****)<br /><br />The sequel to Resident Evil capitalises on the rebirth of the zombie
genre that's been evident this year in the Dawn Of The Dead remake and
Shaun Of The Dead. The difference is, this one's purely about blowing
the creatures up, with the help of a special being.<br /><br />When I watched this film in the cinema, there was no need for the
projectionist to show the end credits. Does that, alone, explain how
laughably bad this film was?<br /><br />Well, truth be told, the film has its potentially redeeming facets.
Both Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory look really fit (now there's a
definite plus for teenage fanboys), and Mike Epps provides very rare
comic relief. But these are hardly reasons to buy a cinema ticket for
this.<br /><br />Everything in Resident Evil: Apocalypse has Hollywood written all over
it. Look at the dodging of bullets and the jumping through windows that
most modern films have been making fun of. If I knew for one second
that the director and screenwriter weren't taking this seriously, I may
have given it an extra star. But nearly all of the laughs I got from
this were from laughing at the bad dialogue and the cartoonish
violence. And before I forget, the bad guy's German. (Yeah, what's
new?)<br /><br />It's fine for the plot to be contrived and make no sense. It's another
to be having little or no fun when watching. At least I can claim to
have enjoyed parts of the Tuxedo. I suppose that this may be some
people's cup of tea, purely for Milla Jovovich and the violence, but in
my opinion this is a brain-dead video game masquerading as a film. Not
recommended.
