2004_September 10 

I just got back from seeing the opening showing at Cine Capri here in
Scottsdale, AZ (technically, Cine Capri is in Phoenix, but anyway...).
I'm a techie who loves Star Trek, Star Wars, the Alien movies, video
games, almost anything computer-related, and almost any sci-fi movie.
So, the high-tech and monster stuff in this movie lured me in. That and
the opportunity to see it at Cine Capri - the LARGEST screen in Metro
Phoenix (outside IMAX, of course) with a 40,000 watt Dolby Digital
sound system! If you don't mind shelling out the dough for this premium
theater, it's definitely the way to go. No, I don't work for them or
anything like that. You'll see how my &quot;gushing&quot; about Cine Capri here
relates to the movie in the last paragraph below.<br /><br />But, I digress - &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; is a very decent sci-fi,
survival horror movie. The acting was pretty good. The action was good.
And, the special f/x were very good. Too, the &quot;bad ass&quot; factor was off
the chart!<br /><br />It has some very suspenseful parts that I enjoyed. However, there were
some minor annoyances - the fight scenes were shot WAY too close to the
action and WAY too jittery; I've seen another movie this summer that
used this same &quot;style&quot; of camera-work - &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; - and it
was the only thing that ruined that movie for me as well. Also, let's
be honest; this is yet another zombie movie. The main &quot;threat&quot; are the
zombies - and, yeah, it's a bit worrisome that if they so much as nip
you, you die pretty quickly from the virus and become a flesh-eating
zombie yourself, but other than that, the zombies aren't too much to
worry about. Their sheer numbers are a problem, but it's cake to take
them out - one pop in the head or break the spinal cord and that's it -
whoop de doo. Don't get me wrong, though - there are many other, more
menacing threats for the characters to deal with, but the zombie threat
gets pretty old pretty quick.<br /><br />So... if you have an AWESOME theater like Cine Capri to see it in, go
for it. Otherwise, wait until it comes out on DVD.
