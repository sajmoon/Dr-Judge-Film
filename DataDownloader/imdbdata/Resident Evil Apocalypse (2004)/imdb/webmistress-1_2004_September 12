Between the critics and reviewers here, my expectations going into
Resident Evil Apocalypse couldn't have been lower, and maybe that was a
good thing. I had read nothing but venom directed at this film.<br /><br />Only in a world gone mad would Spiderman 2 receive glowing reviews
while Resident Evil 2 is slammed.<br /><br />If you dig good old fashioned sci-fi, action, or horror, Resident Evil:
Apocalypse delivers. It's not rocket science ...nor does it have the
depth of, say, Lost In Translation or Dogville ... but it's perfectly
fun if you leave your brain at the door.<br /><br />I also didn't think the movie looked especially cheap ... a criticism
I've seen reiterated at IMDb several times. If every future
&quot;Made-In-Canada&quot; movie looks this good, Hollywood is history.
