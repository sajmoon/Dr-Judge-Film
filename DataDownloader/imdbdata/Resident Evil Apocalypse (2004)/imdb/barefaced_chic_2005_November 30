OK, the script is pretty dire. But this move gives all that it promised
- thrills, spills and gore, without the usual poncing around with
things like plot or character which tends to undo films with more
high-minded aims (28 Days Later springs to mind). It looks great,
sounds cool and is wonderfully camp, a tongue in cheek homage to
computer gaming fluff. You can't watch a zombie movie in seriousness -
the genre was created as a way to satirically represent modern society,
not to be judged alongside Merchant Ivory or Federico Fellini. If you
loved the games and their cheesiness, watch this film. Don't listen to
the critics - trust me, it's a lot of fun!
