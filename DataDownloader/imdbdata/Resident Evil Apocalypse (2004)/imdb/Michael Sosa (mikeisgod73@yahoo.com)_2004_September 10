2004_September 10 

I waited for this movie like a child awaiting the next pokeman or
spongebob movie. I held my breath, i bit my nails, i even drove over 40
minutes just so i could catch the first midnight showing in New
brunswick new jersey. And instead of getting something that could
possibly rival its great predecessor, i got something that only kept me
awake because its annoying sound effects were so loud and so many.
Though the special effects were good, and action was plentiful... the
characters were pale shadows of the game's glory, much of the fight
scenes were blurred and so fast paced that you would need to be the
flash to watch them, and the ending left very much to be desired. I
will buy the DVD just to own the series, and i will watch the third
installment when (if) it comes out... but there will be no holding of
breath.
