Even though the Michael gave this movie a 6/10, I still don&#39;t think
this movie is as bad as people say it is. (in my opinion). There&#39;s good
acting, (by my favorite actress, Milla Jovovich), good visual effects
and good make-up. It&#39;s just that it takes on a story that everyone is
used too. (not saying the story is bad or anything). But I bought the
DVD, and by looking at the special features with all the hard work and
effort that was put into this movie, (and I do mean hard work and
effort), it&#39;s hard to agree that this movie is bad. (cause when you
think hard enough, this movie couldn&#39;t have been better any other way).
So in conclusion, I can&#39;t tell you what to think of this movie, (thats
your decision), but I give an enormous amount of credit for the people
who worked on this movie. the Michael has spoken.
