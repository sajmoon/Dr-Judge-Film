I liked the first movie, it was good average entertainment. I think
this one is slightly better than the first, mainly because this one is
scarier. I admit i preferred the zombies in the Dawn of the dead remake
but thats because they were fast. The script is no great shakes, the
cast are OK. Though the bad guy seemed like he was doing a poor man's
Schindler. The FX was fairly decent and the movie never becomes boring,
it's too fast paced for that. Some of the sets were obviously based on
the games. At least it made me jump out of my seat a few times.
Needless to say a third one seems very likely but i like where there
going with one scene reminding me of Brian De Palma's The Fury. 6 out
