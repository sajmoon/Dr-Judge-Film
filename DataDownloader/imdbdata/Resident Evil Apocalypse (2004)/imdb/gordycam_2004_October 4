What a terrible movie. In every instance I could have told you two
seconds before every zombie jumped out of nowhere with the director
throwing in a loud crash that he was coming. Near the beginning of the
movie, there were a dozen cops with tons of ammo and huge guns just
mowing down zombies that are going slower than Bengie Molina after
lunch, but somehow the main police character still manages to get bit;
give me a break. And when that guy with glasses in the church freaked
out and booked it, tell me you had no idea that he was going to get
exed in about five seconds. Throwing in some senseless nudity and a few
f-bombs (mostly coming from my favorite Mike Epps) to give it a more
just R-rating makes it a true winner. This gets better than an F
overall because it made me laugh more than any movie I've seen this
year simply by being so
