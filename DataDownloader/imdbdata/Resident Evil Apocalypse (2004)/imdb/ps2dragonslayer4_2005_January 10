I liked Alice OK, she is cool. but i loved Jill Valentine. she looked
so like the animated Jill from RE3: nemesis. but i have one
question.... where did Alice exactly come from, i checked all of the
Resident Evil video games and she ain't in none of them. or was she in
one of the video games of RE and had a different name? please answer my
question because i have always been confused about &quot;Alice&quot;. I also
liked Jilly valentine because she had had that sexy outfit on and it
made her look good. the little girl brought out the movie and that's
what made it good. plus you gotta give credit to mike epps, he brought
out the comedy in the movie. i liked it when he said &quot;GTA
Mother*******!! Ten Points!! that is why the movie is pretty good.
