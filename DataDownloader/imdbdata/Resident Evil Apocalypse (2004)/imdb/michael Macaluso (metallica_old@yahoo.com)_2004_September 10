Great movie,it leaves off where the first began and gives the audience
a briefing of what happened in the first movie. Alice is back with some
new abiltys complements of the Unbrella Corparation. It also adds Jill
Valentine who is from the video games. The first movie to me doesn't
really feel like a the game. I like the first one, but it just uses the
basics from the Resident Evil games. This one however feels totally
like a Resident Evil movie, The setting, the characters, Pretty much a
mix of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. My favorite scene
has to be when they are walking threw the grave yard or when Nemesis is
kicking some a**! Nemesis looks really good. I herd some people saying
he looks a little crappy. IMO he looks totally realistic and they
could'nt have done a better job on him. Although I like the film a lot,
it could have used more of a sub story or something else going on to
keep you guessing like the first movie. Other than that the action is
awesome, Jill and Alice are hot. L.J is a great character he has some
funny one liners. Nicholai was pretty cool. Expect RE3. 9/10 stars
