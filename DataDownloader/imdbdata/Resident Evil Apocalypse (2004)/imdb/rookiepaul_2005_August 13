Being a massive fan of the Resident Evil game series, I was a little
disappointed when I saw the first Resident Evil movie. I thought that
the second one might redeem the first as I heard that it was based a
little more around the games, however I was sorely mistaken. THIS IS
THE WORST FILM EVER. Its the fact that the people at Capcom allowed
this director anywhere near the game series, and allowing Paul W S
Anderson to write the story, possibly the biggest school boy error
ever? This movie relies on it's special effects which really arn't that
special. The acting by all is laughable and so bad. There are so many
plot holes, too many to list, just check out the goof section on IMDb.
The only good thing about this movie is the song by killswitch engage
at the end. I can't believe that anyone is funding AW to direct the
next one! I won't be paying to see this next monstrosity. This director
should never work again, as should the writer.
