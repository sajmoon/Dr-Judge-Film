A contiuation of resident evil. This movie captures the complete sci-fi
horror complex with a unique style. Milla Jovovich is superb at playing
the aggravated, distressed, as* kicking heroine. Teaming up with Sienna
Guillory (Jill Valentine), they make a thrilling duo fighting against
the virus threat. The stunts were mind blowing as Alice
(Jovovich)crashes through a church window dodging every piece of glass
in a slalom.<br /><br />With funny, outgoing characters such as L.J (Mike epps) Bringing humour
to this oustounding sequel. With quotes such as 'My sh!t is custom' and
'Ive got this bitch', Resident evil includes at least one aspect of
every genre (accept romance)
