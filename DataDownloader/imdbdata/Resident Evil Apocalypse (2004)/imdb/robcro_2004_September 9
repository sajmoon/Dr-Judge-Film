2004_September 9 

Thursday, September 9, 2004<br /><br />I went to see a preview of this movie last night and I must say it was
a bit of a let down. The first movie had a lot of suspense with
interesting characters. <br /><br />APOCALYPSE is your typical Hollywood blockbuster with a big budget and
big explosions but that's about it. The characters were quite stale
with stale dialogue, especially the quite-anticipated character of Jill
Valentine who seemed like a Lara Croft clone. The actress seemed to be
an amateur who delivered her lines melodramatically.<br /><br />There were too many story lines and characters that did not have the
opportunity of being flushed out in the span of ninety minutes. This
was especially detrimental for the character of Nemesis and his
relation to Alice as it pertains to this movie. Unless your a fan of
the game or book series you would not have a clue.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of horror/action films but would recommend that you
wait for the DVD rental of this one.
