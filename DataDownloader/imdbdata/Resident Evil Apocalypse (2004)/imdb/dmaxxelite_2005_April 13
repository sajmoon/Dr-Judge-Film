It is really a must see, a lot of work and effort obviously went into
making this film, i personally, have seen it about 10 times on rental,
and now have bought both resident evil 1 and 2, i hope there is going
to be a third, and fourth... Fingers Crossed.<br /><br />film contains excellent graphical effects along with great stunts,
non-stop action and you can really relate it to the game... I advise
that you buy it immediately!<br /><br />i advise the purchase of the DVD as it has some rather amusing special
features, but watch the film first.<br /><br />I give this film 10 out of 10
