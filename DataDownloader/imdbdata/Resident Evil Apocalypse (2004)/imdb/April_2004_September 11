Resident evil, Apocalypse. I was so excited to go see this movie as the
original Resident evil is one of my favorites. I was pretty disappointed
though. It just didn't have what the first one had. There was just
something about it. Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, if you
don't compare it to the first one. Milla Jovovich was still wonderful as
alice. But I thought that Sienna Guillory just didn't fit her part. She
was too skinny, and didn't look half as tuff as she acted. She is very
pretty and all, but that just didn't do it for me. She acted almost too
tuff. I mean, what girl (cop) runs around in a corset to fight the
living dead? That was what got me the most. Overall I would give this
movie a 2 out of 5. Go see the movie, but don't expect it to even come
close to the first.
