Resident Evil: Apocalypse is an excellent sequel in my eyes. It didn&#39;t
try to mimic the first film, and did things its own way to further the
storyline. However, too much action just about eliminates the horror
aspect of the series, and the end is just way too out there for my
tastes.<br /><br />Story: Well, that pesky Umbrella Corporation doesn&#39;t know how to leave
well enough alone, and re-opens the Hive, unleashing the virus onto
poor Racoon City. The city becomes a necropolis, and Alice bands
together with a few other survivors in an attempt to escape the city
and bring Umbrella down. This time, Umbrella steps up the game,
unleashing Nemesis, a monster bent on taking them out.<br /><br />Direction: Alexander Witt is no Paul Anderson, but he is a grand action
movie director. He brings a different style and look to this film,
which I liked. However, he never really builds up any suspense or
horror into this film, which was my main problem. Still, he did a solid
job and made a damn good sequel.<br /><br />Acting: Milla Jovovich(Alice) kept her performance from the first film,
but is much tougher. She can do just about anything. Sienna
Guillory(Jill) portrayed the games heroin Jill excellently, and I was
not disappointed with her at all. Mm, sexy! Oded Fehr(Carlos) is one of
my favorites, and as usual, he rocked the part. However, their talent
seemed wasted in this film, because none of the characters really have
any depth.<br /><br />Score: Jeff Danna scored an action film. Not the hardest thing in the
world to do, but he did so with great skill. Though, it was pretty
standard stuff.<br /><br />Violence: As with most sequels, the violence is kicked up a notch or
two. There may be a total of five minutes in between shoot outs if
we&#39;re lucky. The blood level was also increased. We get head shots,
bloody gunshot wounds, zombie bites and related gore, decomposed
bodies, hideous creatures, an exploded head, and impalings. Yum!<br /><br />Profanity/Sexual Themes: Mike Epps was in the film. Enough said about
the language. As far as sexual themes is concerned, we get to topless
zombie strippers, and a naked Milla Jovovich in a tank of liquid.
Nothing to invoke any wood.<br /><br />Substance Abuse: None.<br /><br />Overall: Overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a good zombie sequel.
The only thing that bothered me was that there was no real horror or
suspense. Perhaps even a bit too much action, and the ending was way
too far fetched. Still, I was entertained, and that is all I expected
to be. 7/10
