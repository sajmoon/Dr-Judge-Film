2010_January 26 
I have never played any &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; games, and didn&#x27;t see the first
movie based on the video game series until last month, over seven years
after its theatrical run. I could see how cheesy and immature it was,
but with all the adrenaline, it still left me reasonably satisfied.
That might not be the case if I were to watch it again, but much of it
was a guilty pleasure for me with one viewing. If I hadn&#x27;t liked it at
all, I obviously wouldn&#x27;t have bothered watching this sequel, but I was
impressed enough with the original to be interested in seeing this one.
However, I was not too pleased with &#x22;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x22;, as I
found it not only cheesy, but also not very entertaining. It basically
has all the flaws of its predecessor plus more.<br /><br />After Alice wakes up in the hospital and leaves the building, she
discovers that the virus which infected the people in the Hive
(Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s underground facility), and turned them into
flesh-eating zombies, has escaped and made it to the surface! Raccoon
City is now flooded with these monsters, the kind Alice was previously
forced to fight underground, and the city has been closed off under
quarantine! Alice has been used for genetic experimentation, and as a
result, she has new superpowers, which will come in handy in this
infected city. A group of Umbrella soldiers who have not yet been
infected find themselves having to take on many members of the Undead
and creatures known as Lickers, and just as it looks hopeless during a
battle in the church, Alice comes and rescues them. She joins the
group, and all of them must fight many enemies in order to have any
chance of escaping Raccoon City! <br /><br />This sequel contains some unimpressive acting and dialogue, as well as
underdeveloped characters. All the same can be said about its
predecessor, but here, it gets worse. So much of the film seems like
one big monster fighting scene, and watching it reminded me a lot of
&#x22;Speed 2: Cruise Control&#x22; in that regard. Even though I haven&#x27;t seen
that film in a few years, I clearly remember that a lot of it, probably
most of it, is like one big scene! Now, &#x22;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x22;
isn&#x27;t quite as horribly tedious as that &#x22;Speed&#x22; sequel (I think I&#x27;ve
yet to see another film that actually is), but the non-stop monster
fighting here is still a big problem. It doesn&#x27;t help that this first
&#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; sequel skips around too fast, and the slow motion
effects, among other things, are also cheesy. At least I found a lot of
adrenaline in the first film, which is more than I can say about
&#x22;Apocalypse&#x22;. There are SOME exciting moments here, but certainly not
enough.<br /><br />The first installment in the &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; movie franchise is hated
by many, and I could understand why after seeing it, but since I found
that movie so exciting, I couldn&#x27;t join the haters. When I rented this
sequel, I thought maybe it would be a lot like its predecessor, cheesy
but certainly not boring, but it turns out I was wrong. It could have
easily turned out to be slightly inferior to the original, as sequels
usually are, but to me, it turned out to be worse than that. For most
of the film, I think I had a puzzled look on my face. Basically, I
think the main problems here are that 2004&#x27;s &#x22;Resident Evil:
Apocalypse&#x22; is even more ridiculous than its 2002 predecessor, and it&#x27;s
certainly not very well written. Also, unlike the first film, Paul W.S.
Anderson wrote this one but didn&#x27;t direct it, and Alexander Witt&#x27;s
direction just might have been another factor. Mindless action is
common in modern blockbusters, and it can sometimes be entertaining,
but unfortunately, this is one of the cases where it&#x27;s not.
