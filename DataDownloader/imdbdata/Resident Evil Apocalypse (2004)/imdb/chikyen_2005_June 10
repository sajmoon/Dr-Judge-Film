I don't quite get why every one is complaining about this movie. I'm a
huge fan of RE, esp RE3. I don't know how many times i have played that
game. I've got all the RE games and I love em.<br /><br />So, the movie was a bit of a let down in some places but it was your
basic zombie-bust'em-up.<br /><br />What I thought was a bit pathetic was dragging a kid into it, made it a
bit more family friendly with that. I reckon that was its biggest let
down. Like Jurrassic Park 3, when they had a kid in it, it got cr@p!
But despite the kiddie-factor, RE:A managed to overcome it (mostly -
the main highlight was the bit in the school) It had more suspense than
the first and I reckon this is a good example of where the sequel is
better than the first.<br /><br />A bit cheesy that at the end, obvious sequel to follow!
