As the immediate continuation of the story from the original RESIDENT
EVIL, this film shows us the devastation unleashed upon Raccoon City,
after a virus gets out and turns everyone into flesh-biting zombies.
Alice, who now seems to have attained superhuman powers, teams up with
some soldiers with guns and attempts to fight her way through the
living dead and back into normalcy.Resident evil 2 is intense and fast
paced,a perfect action thriller.lot&#39;s of gun fights,karate
sequences,explosions therefore a sweet action flick.the best thing is
how the story is explained briefly but in detail then gets straight to
the action.finally an action movie that realizes it&#39;s an action movie
and doesn&#39;t try to be more than that.all in all a good movie,neat
story,good acting,amazing action sequences,and a whole lot of fun.just
two girls kicking some zombie @$$.
