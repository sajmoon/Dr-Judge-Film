2004_September 11 

There's only way to describe this movie- utterly awful. I found myself
laughing through the whole thing since what was happening was
completely ridiculous. I think they did every possible thing for this
movie in the worst way, even the simple things.<br /><br />First of all, the video games were great. They're classics, hense why
Resident Evil was remade more than five years after its original
release. I'm not an extremely creative person, but it wouldn't be
difficult at all, even as an independent movie, to make an adaptation
of the game. After all, isn't that what the point of making a Resident
Evil movie is? If he wants to go on his own little suck spree with his
awful ideas, why doesn't he leave Resident Evil out of it and make a
completely different zombie movie?<br /><br />Second of all, there are so many plot holes you're afraid to even
wonder thinking you might get stuck with ridiculously abstract thinking
(which is the only way to try to explain the things in this movie!).
Jill Valentine, who was in the first two Resident Evil games and more,
makes her first appearance with no background information. She walks
into the police place in skimpy clothing and says, &quot;Shoot them in the
head.&quot; Everyone listens. As the writer has obviously taken the very
minimum from the Resident Evil storyline, you can't be left to believe
she survived at a mansion in the outskirts of Raccoon City. So she must
have had an epiphany when she awoke that morning (please prevent
yourself from thinking of any other reason, you will have literally
wasted a precious few seconds of your life). Not to mention that Alice
somehow knows EVERYTHING about Nemesis (God forbid there be any
purposely open-ended questions), Alice makes no sense, dead people in
cemeteries somehow manage to get infected while six feet underground,
some guy at the end is shot but randomly gets infected WITHOUT being
bit, Nemesis and Alice have a Mortal Kombat style (no joke, it beings
with some guy yelling &quot;FIGHT!&quot; and ending with him saying &quot;FINISH HIM!&quot;
But it ended with Alice performing a Friendship instead of a Fatality),
and for some reason zombies completely ignore important characters when
they're making &quot;dramatic&quot; speeches. <br /><br />Lastly, the acting and all around film work is completely awful. You'd
like to see a zombie bite someone, wouldn't you? But because they had
two thousand camera angles and some guy with Parkinson's disease was
doing the film editing (in case you don't catch the pun, people with
Parkinsons shake uncontrollably). That might also explain why the
zombies move all slow, which is cool and freaky, but for some reason
they DJ the film and make it go super fast, normal, then slow? This is
the way it is for every action scene, as if they're trying to rush the
movie so you won't have to sit through more of it. Not like the
hand-to-hand fighting scene would be cool if you could see what was
happening anyway. The acting is just awful. I don't know about anyone
else, but I'd be a little freaked/emotional if everyone in my city was
running after me to eat me. Not these people though, they act like
they're just as calm as they would be at a photo shoot. Or hell if you
saw your best friend get shot or eaten in front of you, that's no
reason to show emotion...is it? <br /><br />See this movie if you want a good laugh at how awful it is, or a good
cry at how good the video games are and how this writer just ruined
your dreams. The movie makes a mockery of everything it can possibly
touch, including the scene where someone &quot;hacks&quot; into Umbrella by
typing into his Vaio- &quot;open hack.exe&quot;. Not to mention they completely
screwed up on doing so many things. People that aren't bit turn into
zombies. Windows are broken while driving a Harley through it, and
somehow pieced back together and re-broken when the lamest scene I've
ever seen in a movie occurs just seconds later. Nuclear missiles can be
shot from helicopters and guided through city streets...right? I'd rate
this as a 2/10, only allowing for a 2 because I did have a good laugh
by the end. If you enjoy dropping empty water bottles onto the ground
over and over again, you'll enjoy this movie, but only slightly.
