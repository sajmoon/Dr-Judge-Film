A real treat for fans of RE, horror, sci fi or action<br /><br />I really enjoyed RE Apocalypse, but it's surely not for all tastes. If
you are a fan of the games, you will like it. Horror, sci fi or action
buffs will also get a kick out of it, even if you haven't played the
games. However, if you dislike such genres, or have an aversion to
beautiful women kicking boo-tay, than you may want to stray from this
one. However, if you like to see beautiful women kicking boo-tay, then
I highly recommend this one!<br /><br />This is a direct sequel to 2002's Resident Evil, and Milla Jovovich
reprises her role as Alice, again doing a nice job. Imbued with
super-human strength and speed, courtesy of Umbrella, Alice teams up
with a small group of survivors, including Jill Valentine (Sienna
Guillory, who gives an outstanding performance), to escape Raccoon
City, which is now infected with the T-Virus, infesting the city with
zombies (this is where the first movie left off)! Not only must they
make it out of the city ASAP, but Umbrella has unleashed a new menace,
the Nemesis, into the city...<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie. As a longtime fan of the games, I found
the first movie to be very true to the games, and very enjoyable. The
second movie deviates a little more from the games than the first movie
did, but not by much. There are many homages and scenes lifted from the
games, so if you are really familiar with the games, it will put a
smirk on your face. Though I wouldn't call RE Apocalypse a &quot;realistic&quot;
movie, I found the movie to be somewhat more believable and realistic
than the games, overall. The production values are fine, and there are
many monsters, not just zombies and the Nemesis. The dogs, as seen in
the first movie, make a nice re-appearance, too. The effects and
monsters are cool, and the atmosphere is tense when it should be, and
action-packed when it needs to be. The story is nice, and is basically
a re-enactment of the third game, RE3: Nemesis, with a few creative
liberties (natch). The score is decent, though Apocalypse uses silence
in many scenes to great effect. The &quot;shock rock&quot; from the first movie
reappears as well, so if you like that, then you'll like the music
here. The acting is overall, pretty good, with a real standout from
Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine. First time director Alexander Witt
does a nice job, and I was really pleasantly surprised here. A sequel
that surpasses the original! Go see this movie, it's awesome!<br /><br />9/10
