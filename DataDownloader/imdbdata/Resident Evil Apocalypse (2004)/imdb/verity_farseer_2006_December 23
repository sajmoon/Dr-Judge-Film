Don&#39;t be put off by the low rating on this page - its been dragged down
by very pathetic fans of the games who despite the fact that it has
been nearly five years since the release of the first movie still
haven&#39;t come to terms with the films.<br /><br />This film does exactly what is expected of it - it&#39;s got two hot
actresses in little clothing, good actions sequences, humor and the
acting is good (especially for Milla), people who tell you otherwise
are usually Game-Loving/Film-Hating. Don&#39;t expect any vast life
changing lesson from the film because its not trying to do that.<br /><br />The script is passable and moves the story at a good pace - most of the
fights are by the script bar two but those two are just so dam good
that you don&#39;t really mind.<br /><br />One special mention has to go out to Seinna Gulliory who plays Jill -
not only does she look the part but she plays it perfectly. It would
have been very easy for her to just fade in comparison to the killing
machine Alice but instead has emerged as one of the film-lovers
favorite characters. Her accent is perfect and came as a big shock to
me when I found out she was English.<br /><br />Bottom Line - Don&#39;t be fooled by the low rating - it succeeds at what
it aims at - its just a dam good and enjoyable action/horror for the
majority of the population who don&#39;t spend every minute of their lives
glued to the Games.
