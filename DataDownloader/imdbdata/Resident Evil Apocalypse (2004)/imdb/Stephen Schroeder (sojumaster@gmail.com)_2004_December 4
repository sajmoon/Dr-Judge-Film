This movie need some adult supervision in its production, script
writing and editing. This &quot;movie&quot;, and i use that term in the most
liberal sense possible, looks like a bunch of 8th graders (Sorry if I
offend any 8th graders out there) were given complete reign over this
movie from start to finish.<br /><br />if it weren't for the fact that you had extremely loud explosions and
gun fights from time to time ... OK most of the movie... I would have
fell asleep in the theater. This movie was boring, badly edited, poorly
directed, badly acted, plot less, pointless, worthless.<br /><br />if you are just looking for plot less, shot em up movies then this is
the movie for you. But then you might even be disappointed with this
movie still. I can not believe that any studio really allowed this
movie to go past the script stage. I personally would have wrote on the
front page of the script, &quot;This is total garbage, please look for
another job, you are wasting our time.&quot; , even if it was only the first
20 pages were even looked at.<br /><br />The ONLY good thing out of this movie is that this gives hope to ANYONE
that is attempting to make it to Hollywood, that they have a solid
chance in making it. I don't ever have the greatest sense on script
writing, but I believe I could have scripted this movie in a couple
days being completely drunk a lot better then this piece of garbage.<br /><br />On the Snooze Scale from one Z to ten Z's this was a solid ZZZZZZZZ(8)
