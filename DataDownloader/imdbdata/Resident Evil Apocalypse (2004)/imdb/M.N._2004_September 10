Let me first get technical. At first, the flimsy camera work and cheesy
effects made me doubt this was going to be a good movie. I'm glad I was
proven wrong. After the first 20 minutes, the camera work got smoother
and stable, and the effects kept on getting better and better.<br /><br />As for the plot, you get some good insights on Umbrella, and even if
the end lends itself towards another sequel, it won't leave you hanging
with a bunch of loose ends.<br /><br />Expect a zombie movie with a lot of action. If your typical tastes are
light comedies and drama, don't get all worked up to give this movie a
bad review. It's for the fans, and it delivers. The movie overall is
well put, well worth it, and if you can handle the first twenty
minutes, it turns out for the best.
