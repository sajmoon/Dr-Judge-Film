Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the best movie I've seen this year. It's a
non-stop movie from start to finish. The movie take place where the
first one ended which is good because it combines the first movie to
the second which explains the first one better of how everything got
started in the first place with the research of the T-virus. This movie
had a lot more action, comedy, and heart stopping scary scenes where
you know something is about to happen but you don't. Resident Evil even
had as some one said in the theater it's that scary girl from the first
movie, but this time she was real and go figure she was the first with
the T-virus developed by her father to make her walk because it does
reanimate dead cells. The movie also had good fight scenes with the two
main nemesis the guy that started mutating at the end of the first one
and Alice. Yet, of course, love beats the hate they have for each other
because Alice and him remember each other.<br /><br />The best thing is that Alice lives, stronger then ever and the Umbrella
Corporation continues its studies which leaves it open for another
great sequel!
