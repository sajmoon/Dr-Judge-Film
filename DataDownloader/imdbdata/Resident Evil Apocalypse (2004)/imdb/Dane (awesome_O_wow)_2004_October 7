This film is amazing, it intersects both the game and film side of
resident evil, amazing special effects and Alice and Jill are hott! an
in depth and interesting story, with a REALLY anticipating ending and
cliffhanger. There will definitely be a third one. A mixture of
creatures this time and nemesis was ace, the playoff between him and
Alice at the end was immense. the action scenes were very often so it
keeps you awake and peeled, making you want to know what happens next.
a bit at the end with Alice is exciting but disappointing as.. she cant
turn bad..&quot;activate the Alice program&quot; good idea, cant wait for the
next one! new weapons, vehicles, characters, nothing like the
original... better! xox
