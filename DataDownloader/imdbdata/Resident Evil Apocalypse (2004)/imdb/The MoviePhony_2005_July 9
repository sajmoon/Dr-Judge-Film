I want to let you know that this is my 3rd time I've watched the DVD
version of &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse.&quot; I truly enjoyed the sequel 11
times better than the original picture.<br /><br />Based on the popular Nintendo GameCube video game and other platforms,
Apocalypse picks up where the first film ended. After escaping from the
Hive facility of The Umbrella Corporation, Alice (played by Mila
Jovovich) fights once again in a war between the human race and the
undead. Under quarantine, Raccon City is completely locked down. Then,
Alice teams up with a small band of vigilant soldiers led by S.T.A.R.
officer Jill Valentine (played by British actress Sienna Guillory) and
an outcast of Umbrella Corp. Carlos and Nikolai portrayed by Zach Ward
from &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;. An action/horror film isn't complete without
some comedy relief. After Friday and Friday After Next's Mike Epps adds
laughter and ad-libs to the picture and never gets very awkward or
bored.<br /><br />Filled with undead zombies, Lickers, mutant dogs and Umbrella's
ultimate weapon of mass destruction, Nemesis, special effects and
incredible stunts, film director Alexander Witt have truly
revolutionize the way how a video game to film should work. I'm sure
that director Paul Anderson (also produces this film) should learn a
thing or two about directing films.<br /><br />My highest possible recommendation is to buy the DVD. On the first
disc, you get to see 2 different formats of the film (wide and full
screen), and special features that includes deleted scenes, exclusive
behind the scenes, and movie trailers on the second. For all of you
video game freaks out there, go out and buy Apocalyse right now. But to
some of them who don't like graphic violence of the film, do not buy or
rent... this is only for the hardcore sci-fi horror film buffs.
Overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse earns a frighteningly perfect 10!!!!
Way to go, Alex and Paul...!
