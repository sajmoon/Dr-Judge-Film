Confusing and silly. That&#39;s the best you are going to get out of me.
Pointless action scenes, 2D characters and an ending that makes zero
sense in anyway. So many unanswered questions....Why does Mila
Whatshername smash through the plate-glass window of the church with a
motorcycle? Why would anyone want to live in a city that is designed
with a half-mile high border/fence/medieval wall? Why is there only one
exit to the city. Racoon City? Are you kidding me???!!?? The Computer
monsters look horrible. Totally fake. The little you see of the zombies
is ruined by blurry camera work. &quot;Nemesis&quot; looks like a CGI turd.<br /><br />Really, Really Bad
