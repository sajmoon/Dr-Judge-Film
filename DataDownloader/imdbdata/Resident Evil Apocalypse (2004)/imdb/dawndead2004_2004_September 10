Where does this movie fit into the overall story of the resident evil
franchise of video games? I can't figure out where in the timeline
between Jill walking into her apartment after the reopening of the Hive
(beginning of the movie here) and the events at the end of the movie
does the events of Residen Evil 3 Nemesis factor in?<br /><br />The movie was great, don't get me wrong. Non-stop action, Alice, and
Jill make it well worth seeing. Eye candy never gets old these days.
However, the ending disappointed me. I'm not gonna give away anything,
I just wanted to say get out the fact that I was severely disappointed
by it. In time, we'll see if the movie succeeds better than its
predecessor. And if it even comes close I fully expect another in five
years or so.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, unless you're an uber fan of the series, or of
action movies in general, wait for it to hit video. Unless of course
you're like me and can appreciate the side benefit of seeing Milla
again. She makes it worth it.
