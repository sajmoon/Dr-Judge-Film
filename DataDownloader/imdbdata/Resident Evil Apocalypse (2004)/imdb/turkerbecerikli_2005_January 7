I've played all series of RE video games. And when i heard about
&quot;Nemesis&quot; i thought it would be great. The visual effect of &quot;Nemesis&quot;
was great. But for video game, Nemesis' big enemy is Jill Valentine and
all STARS members, not Alice. The problem was that for me. When i
watched the movie i cant believe my eyes because &quot;Nemesis&quot; has showed
mercy someone. The Nemesis profile in my mind was not that. And what
about the rest of Racoon City? But the biggest bullshit was Alice. I
cant remember that kid of &quot;creature&quot; in video game contents. For a
magazine, that movie was in the worst 10 movies in 2004. I think its
very bad for RE fans.........................................
