Resident evil apocalypse is an excellent movie. it contains enough
violence and at the same time it has that little humor that a good
movie needs, for example a malicious comments. Resident evil apocalypse
is an excellent and well made mix between a really scary horror movie
and an exploding action movie. Resident evil apocalypse is the goddamn
best movie i&#39;ve ever seen, it&#39;s the perfect movie for a video gaming
teenager like me:D. The only negative whit this movie is that all the
characters from the games isn&#39;t correctly made, like Nicholai, he is a
large man shooting zombies whit a soft-air gun. One more of the bad
things, is that this movie aren&#39;t based directly on any of the games,
instead the director has taken some pieces from 2 or 3 resident evil
games.
