Wrong, wrong, wrong!!! Hollywood you are doing it all wrong again. This
isn't a proper suspense-movie. New characters are thrown in this movie
every minute, they mention there name only once, then they instantly
get killed and are already forgotten a second later. The only two
characters the viewer could possibly care about are Alice and Jill
Valentine. And the Jill character is hardly developed and enters the
film without the right introduction.<br /><br />Now every good filmmaker knows that building the suspense during the
film will give maximal impact at the end. Obviously these guys don't
know. Already the first two minutes I see zombies running down the
street killing of people. Cops pumping 200 rounds of ammunition into
the zombies bodies and there are explosions everywhere.<br /><br />And what is the deal with all those curse words. Don't they have any
idea that kids will watch this trash to. I thought Hollywood made all
audience movies these days. A PG-13 rating would give us a movie just
as bad as the R rating gave us.<br /><br />But the real problem with this movie is the editing. This is by far the
worst editing I have ever seen in a film. The scene at the graveyard
where Alice and her mates get harassed by zombies who come out of the
ground is horrendous. The fight scene here is about a one-frame cut.
The camera constantly moves real fast, and you can't recognize any
moves or any of the characters who are executing them. But if you
thought that this scene was bad just wait for the fight between the
Nemesis and Alice. Boy what were the director, cameraman and editor
thinking here. Probably 'I get paid anyway so what the hell.'<br /><br />Admitting that I saw a 'making of' on TV before I went to the theatre,
you might think they warned me enough to avoid this porker. But no I
was stupid enough to pay 10 hard earned Euros. To keep you from making
the same mistake, I will give you some words of advice:<br /><br />This movie is a complete waste of money and time. Roger Ebert wrote: 'I
you meet anybody who likes this movie, don't let them date your
children'. I couldn't agree more. The first Resident Evil wasn't a
masterpiece, but compared to this joke it could have been a multiple
Oscar winner. Avoid this one at all cost except if you are
contemplating suicide!
