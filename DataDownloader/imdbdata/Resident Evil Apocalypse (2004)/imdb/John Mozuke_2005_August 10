I really wanted to like or love this movie. I had high expectations
cause I liked the first one so much. I must say I was really
disappointed. I think that it was almost like a &quot;less is more&quot; kind of
thing. This movie seemed to have a bigger budget and they did a lot
more elaborate stunts and make up but it just doesn't measure up to Res
1. I know that Millas character is evolving and she is suppose to be
becoming super fit but she looks way too skinny and to me its like they
did everything in their power to make her look unattractive. The story
is good and its one of those movies that leaves you just thinking,
&quot;this could have been and should be so much better.&quot; It worth watching
but...
