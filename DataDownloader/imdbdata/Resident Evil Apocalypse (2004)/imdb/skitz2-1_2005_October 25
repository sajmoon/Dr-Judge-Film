This is just a bad movie and there is no getting around it. But first i
should say i enjoyed the first and have played the games. And this is
just stupid it reminded me of what a complete lack of direction looks
like.The story was complete lunacy delivered horribly by people who i
have seen acting before just not here. Some would say that that was not
the point it was only to be entertained well i was not the fight scenes
were stupid and poorly edited. They also did not show a lick of
originality, wow skeletons popping out of graves followed by a close-up
of a worm crawling through a skull. The fight at the end was so tightly
edited i could not see a single move. As Milla Jovovich who now has
super powers kills random people in black body armor, i too feel like i
have cheated. This movie fails on every level.
