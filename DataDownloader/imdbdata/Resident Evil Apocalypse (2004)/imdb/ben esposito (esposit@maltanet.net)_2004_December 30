This movie rocks! Non stop action from beginning till end, amazing
special effects and Yovovich looks stunning as always. The music works
well and the fight scenes are great; there is some cool kung fu
fighting going on and they make the actors look like heroes. But there
is one thing that i did not really like about this film. The acting of
some of the actors was not convincing enough and certain special
effects did not amaze me at all; those red monsters in the cathedral
were ridiculous. The movie is based on the game which I never played
but I am pretty sure that the game fans will love this movie. Yovovich
is one of the most beautiful actors/models and in the movie she gives a
very close resemblance to the main character in the game. The theme and
the plot of the movie is based on infected humans turned to zombies.
But I'm really fed up of watching zombie movies this year (Dawn of the
dead). This film was only worth for the fight scenes i.e. the whole
film, and the actress! ... the rest could have been done a bit better I
guess.
