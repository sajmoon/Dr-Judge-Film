First off, the rating of 9 out of 10 is based on a video game movie
rating and how it keeps true to the game itself. I have read both
positive and negative reviews on this movie and I do not want to say
right and wrong but the negative commenters are expecting too much.<br /><br />The action is even better than the first one, which I loved, the
characters and the cast chosen to play them are even better and their
chemistry really shows. No, they are not great actors but they are good
enough to do the job. This movie mostly stays true to the game
(actually I have never seen a movie that is 100% on with a book or a
game) and any gamer should enjoy it.<br /><br />Basically Racoon City has come under attack by the T-Virus. This is an
engineered virus that makes humans into the walking undead but there is
a twist. There is a woman and a little girl, Alice and Angela, who were
purposely injected with the virus. Alice worked for the Umbrella
corporation and she was injected to be the super-human fighting machine
and Angela was injected to help overcome some childhood illnesses. The
movie is then basically an attempt to escape the city before the
corporation launches a nuclear warhead. From there on the action is
non-stop and exciting but there is some light comedic relief by Epps. <br /><br />To make this short, if you like video games and realize that this is a
VG movie then you will like this movie. But if you are one of those
people who have never heard of the game and go to theater, see this
title and decide to give it a shot then you will probably not like it
and be very confused.
