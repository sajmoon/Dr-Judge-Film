I'm not about to turn into one of those chicks watching the first
appearance of the Beatles on Ed Sullivan, but I love this movie.<br /><br />First of all, Milla (no one ever needs to mention her last name) was,
quite frankly, very, very sexy. She looked much better than in the last
movie, and her outfit was awesome if only because you could see her
belly button.<br /><br />Next (Because this review is SO linear) Siena Whoever was god damn
GORGEOUS.<br /><br />And so we have a movie featuring two hot chicks with guns killing
zombies. Let me repeat that for emphasis.<br /><br />Two Hot Chicks With Guns Killing Zombies.<br /><br />Zombies. <br /><br />I'm not going to lie to you. The scene where Jill walks into a police
station and summarily executes about five zombies with a round to the
head wasn't as good as sex. But it wasn't far off.<br /><br />Okay. In this movie, Alice now has super powers. Ultimately this means
that she can jump ten feet in the air utilizing anime physics. Loved
it.<br /><br />Also, there is a Flagrant Anti-Corporate message in this movie. It may
even go so far as to compare Corporatism (new buzz word) with Nazi
Fascism. A round of applause for that. Up yours, Corporate America.<br /><br />And now for the dogs. They covered dogs in barbecue sauce to make this
film.<br /><br />ZOMBIE DOGS PROVE GOD!!!!!!!! <br /><br />But, well. On the Negative Side. The scene where the zombies rise from
their graves is a certain demerit. Modern Secular (Viral) Zombies
should never be depicted as rising from graves. And no explanation was
given as to how an entire graveyard full of people was infected by the
T-Virus. The only method of transmission, as it was established in the
last film, is biting. (Thus the safest place to be during a zombie
outbreak is buried). <br /><br />Second demerit: That bizarre, amateurish video technique sometimes used
to show the zombies was, well, upsetting. <br /><br />But I don't want to end the review on that note. Because I love this
movie.<br /><br />Here's Something Positive: Alice has five Umbrella goons pointing their
laser sight guns at her, and telling her to drop her own gun. Does she
surrender her weapon. Yes. Drops her gun.<br /><br />OR DOES SHE? <br /><br />Utilizing more anime physics, she catches her gun just before it hits
the ground and plugs all five a' them bastards. <br /><br />And I would rather watch Resident Evil - Apocalypse than the following
movies: Taxi Driver, The Godfather (because there are no zombies, and
the Luca Brasi character is completely under-used), and Any Other
Movie.<br /><br />Thank You.
