Yet another movie which is less interesting than the video game it is
based on.<br /><br />It&#39;s another paint-by-numbers script featuring characters who are not
as interesting as they think they are. In fact, none of the characters
are fleshed out enough for either the audience or the characters
themselves to care about them. <br /><br />The cinematography looks muddy throughout the film. The shaky camera
work and hokey slow-mo sequences are distracting and make all the
action scenes appear as though one is viewing them in one&#39;s peripheral
vision.<br /><br />To relive the film without coughing up the money for it, I recommend
watching a reflection in a window of someone playing the video game.
