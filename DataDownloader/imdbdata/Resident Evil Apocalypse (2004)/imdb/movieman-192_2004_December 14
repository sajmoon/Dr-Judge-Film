Resident Evil: Apocalypse was pretty much a bit of a disappointment, I
was looking forward to this movie. Before I watched this movie myself a
lot of people had told me that its not good like part one, but i wanted
to give it a go anyways, they were all right this lacked the great
script &amp; gore of the original movie. In my opinion this movie was bad
as Alien vs Predator. This movie felt like a B grade movie &amp; did not at
any stage get to a level of greatness as the first. Yes the movie is
nowhere near as good as the first but it does get interesting towards
the end, one thing I didn't like in this movie were the action
sequences, they seemed so fake &amp; not even realistic, I don't know why
this movie has an R rating because the gore in this movie was non
existent. Milla Jovovich was the only good thing in this movie, if she
wasn't in this there is no way I would have watched it. Here is how I
rate this movie <br /><br />Acting: 5 / 10 <br /><br />Gore / Special Effects: 4 / 10 <br /><br />Story / Plot: 3.5 / 10<br /><br />Overall: 4.5 / 10
