I quite liked the first RE-movie (6/10). I also enjoyed playing
Resident Evil 3 upon which this movie seems to be very loosely based.
So, while I didn't expect very much (because of the reviews) I still
expected to be at least somewhat entertained for 90 minutes. Problem
is: I wasn't entertained for 90 minutes. I wasn't entertained at all.<br /><br />The main problem with the movie is that there are no characters. Sure,
there are people in the movie, but we don't get to know them. They're
just there, running about, shooting zombies, acting cool. I couldn't
care less about what happened to these mannequins. Another problem is
the disjointed narrative. It takes way to long to get the main
&quot;characters&quot; together, and before they manage to do that the movie is
very boring. This is because, as I said, it feels disjointed and
episodic. Yet another problem is the acting. Most of these people
couldn't act to save their lives.<br /><br />It's probably unfair to compare it to other recent zombie flicks such
as 28 Days Later, Shaun of the Dead and the remake of Dawn of the Dead.
All of these movies I like a lot. But they're not only action movies,
they are as much dramas or comedies with a bit of horror in the mix. I
guess the only movie I can fairly compare RE: Apocalypse to is the
first RE movie. The comparison is sure to be unfavourable. As
mentioned, I actually liked that movie.<br /><br />RE: Apocalypse is sadly a disjointed and boring mess. (2/10)
