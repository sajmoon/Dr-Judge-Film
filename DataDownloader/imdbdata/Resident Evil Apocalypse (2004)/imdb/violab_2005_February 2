I've seen first movie, which was great, and personally I don't think
the sequel is half as good. It's not even the same genre. It was too
much Tomb Raider-like, and that doesn't suit the movie at all,
especially after watching Dawn of the dead. After the GREAT music of
the first movie, Apocalypse doesn't have at least one catchy theme.
It's full of clich&eacute;s, (such as bullet-time effect) that were use a
million times. The characters are ridiculous... It seems the creators
wanted to create an epic movie that turned out to be Tomb raider 3In a
bad way. Even Mila's outfit is almost identical to Angelina Jolie's in
TR, Overall I rated it 3. If you liked the first one do yourself a
favor and don't ruin the illusion.
