This is the kind of movie that will appeal to 15 year olds addicted to
video games and suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder. Any extended
dialog beyond 30 seconds would lose them in confusion and slow the pace
of the film down. Doh...<br /><br />Jeez, this is even worse than the first one (which I thought had some
potential had they not held back on the gore) with lousy CGI, bad
dialog and hokey action sequences. In fact, what little dialog there
is, is held to tired, smart-alecky remarks and the standard clich&eacute;s
that we've heard ka-zillion times before. Same old, same old....
(yawn....)<br /><br />All the characters in the film are clich&eacute;s themselves with the men
acting either evil or irrelevant (and not terribly smart) while the
action babes hold the show in an effort to get the horny teenage males
juices going.<br /><br />It's all part of that bogus &quot;let's empower women&quot; act that Hollywood's
been hooked on the last few years, only they don't have Michelle
Rodriguez in there to make it look convincing. She's one of the few out
there who can carry off that kind of thing and make the action babe
look entertaining, as far as I'm concerned. Too bad she was killed off
in the first film.<br /><br />There's nothing new about this. It's not even a particularly
interesting story this time around, but with today's wigger generation,
is there anything out there that is? <br /><br />Lowest rating. If I could give it a zero, I would.<br /><br />1 out of 10
