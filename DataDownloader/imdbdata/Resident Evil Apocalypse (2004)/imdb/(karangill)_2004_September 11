&gt;&gt;Greatest Horror/Action Flick of the modern era....&lt;&lt;<br /><br />I just saw RE Apocalypse and let me tell you that if you give this
movie anything below 10 you should be shot or mutated into someone
better. The actions sequences are awesome, the dialogue is solid and
funny and the acting is well executed. Milla is a goddess playing Alice
and the decision to include game-based characters such as Jill, Carlos
and Nicholai couldn't have come at a better time. All action freaks
Resident Evil fans or not will be overwhelmed. The movie's music is
better than the first one plus there's NEMESIS and he looks exactlty
like the mean MF from the game.....This movie rocks from beginning to
end. Anyone who gives this movie less than ten will have NEMESIS set
upon them. . A score of '9' is negotiable. WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!!!!
