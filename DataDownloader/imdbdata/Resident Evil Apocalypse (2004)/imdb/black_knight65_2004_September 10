Bad clich&eacute;s, Bad acting, Bad fight scenes; completely predictable, this
movie is simply TERRIBLE. I actually feel dumber for watching it. Two
hours I'll never get back. This movie makes &quot;Tango and Cash&quot; almost
good. There is nothing new here. Present are all the typical movie
clich&eacute;s have been used in every &quot;B&quot; movie since 1970. The fight scenes
are HORRIBLE; lots of camera motion, blurry pan shots and not much
ability to actually follow the fight choreography. Filled with
ridiculous stunts and implausible outcomes, the story has way too many
unexplained holes that it makes it difficult to keep your attention.
Plus, I've seen better acting in &quot;C&quot; grade adult movies. <br /><br />At least some of the Previews were entertaining.<br /><br />Save your money and your time.
