They had a hit with the first movie! It was actually good! But did they
decided to build off the tension and intrigue: No! RE2 proved to be
another in the long line of tired sequels, a killshot to the head and
to the hearts of those that liked the original. Maybe Paul W.S.
Anderson should have directed this movie (of then again, maybe not: AVP
stunk). The energy, the darkness, the distinct flavor of the first film
were no where to be seen, for instead, they were replaced with random
action sequences and useless dialogue. <br /><br />That was just one of the many downfalls of the entire movie. It was all
action, no suspense. It was completely contradictory to the first
movie, even if it is following the games scripts more closely than
ever. However, cannibalization of a lot of good ideas shouldn't be set
aside to help bolster the street cred with those that play the game. In
all, this movie needed a major overhaul, and no one seems to be up to
the task to keep this franchise moving.
