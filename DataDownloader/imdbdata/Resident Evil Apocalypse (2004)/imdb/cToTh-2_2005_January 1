Unbelievable if you do not believe in government and/or corporate
conspiracies. That aside, the movie was unbelievably awesome. I
thoroughly enjoyed it. It seems that perhaps 9 times out of 10, sequels
never meet the flair of the first movie, but this movie was not the
case.<br /><br />In fact, in some respects, I enjoyed this movie more than the first.
Perhaps its the increased involvement and conspiracy-driven motivations
of the Umbrella Corp. I used to be a fan of the X-Files, and I enjoyed
most of the government conspiracy story lines. I love that sort of
stuff.<br /><br />This movie, however, would have been perfect had there been more
monster designs. Perhaps they did not want to overdo it, but I also
like that sort of stuff. And it would have been nice to see more of the
undead designs. Sometimes the camera only showed fleeting glances, so
it was difficult to see how they were modified.<br /><br />So if you like hot babes kicking ass, monsters and corporate
conspiracies, you can't go wrong with this one. 9 stars out of 10.
