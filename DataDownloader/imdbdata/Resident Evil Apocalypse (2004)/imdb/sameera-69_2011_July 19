2011_July 19 
The plot is paper thin with nearly no real complications for the
audience until the last ten minutes (which is a near-complete turn
around from the original, which actually evoked SOME thought from the
audience). It is basically unleash zombies on the city and shoot &#x27;em
up. The small sub-plots really vary from little to no relevance in the
story whatsoever. It is pretty predictable that there is some kind of
&#x27;oh no, my friend was bitten and eventually, I&#x27;ll have to kill him just
before he bites me&#x27; situation, and the big action/set pieces are
blatantly set up. The characters are thinner than the plot, with their
arcs being straighter than a steel arrow. Alice begins the movie as an
ass-kicking femme fatal, and finishes the film being...oh, you guessed
it, an ass- kicking femme fatal. Jill Valentine (Guillory) is another
one of these masculinely tough females, although sans Alice&#x27;s super
powers. The only real life that is brought to the script is through the
epitome of black stereotypes, played by Mike Epps. It was sadly ironic,
however that my favorite bit of &#x27;Apocalypse&#x27; involved a reference to
another video game franchise. <br /><br />Again, &#x27;RE: Apocalypse&#x27; is not completely bad. Although few, it has its
moments. Mike Epps has his funny lines and his one encounter with the
Nemesis brought laughs from the entire audience, which was something
needed in the film. The Nemesis was done well a majority of the time
(although there is a bit where the big oaf crashes through a wall and
his head piece actually shifts visibly on the actor&#x27;s shoulders) and
makes a formidable villain for a good margin of the film (although his
closure is a bit weak). Many of the action sequences had great
potential...but the majority of those action scenes were fast-cut, much
like &#x27;AvP&#x27;, so much so that it was very hard at moments to see exactly
what was happening in the shot. <br /><br />&#x27;Apocalypse&#x27; suffices much more as an action movie than it does as a
horror film, and it struggles to keep interest, even for someone who
has faithfully played the video games. I will be glad to admit,
though...&#x27;Apocalypse&#x27; has the BIGGEST, most unexpected scare of 2004. I
won&#x27;t say when or where...but I am glad to have experienced it.
&#x27;Apocalypse&#x27; isn&#x27;t exactly worth all eight dollars of your admission
fee, but it doesn&#x27;t make a bad Saturday afternoon matinee...6/10.
