I normally love sequels and love movies based on video games or comics
when they are done right. They should be able to get continuing viewers
as well as new viewers involved with the story and up to speed quickly
then move ahead. This movie does neither of those. <br /><br />The movie starts out pretty good but then it becomes very confusing,
very quickly. Characters are introduced with no explanation and often
with no rationale. Jill Valentine is a character who seems to have been
introduced solely to give another sexy woman a reason to strut around
in a very skimpy dress (not that I am complaining). I gathered she was
an off duty cop but why would she strap her guns on and put on her
boots but not take time to put on a shirt or pants? Wouldn't that
shoulder holster start to chafe bare shoulders? How did she know to
immediately start shooting zombies in the head? Maybe there was
something in the original but I sure don't remember it or remember her
character. <br /><br />Alice is yet another example of the movie makers trying to find ways to
put her in skimpy outfits then trying to come up with a reason. They
did not try very hard to get a reason. She is shown nearly nude or nude
more times than is necessary (again, not that I am complaining - though
I will admit that her nude is not as good as skimpy clothed in the
right clothes..). <br /><br />The camera work also distracted more than added to the movie. I do not
understand the overwhelming desire of so many directors to shoot with
handhelds and use jerky pictures. It makes me dizzy and almost always
just confuses the scene. If confusion were the real desire, maybe it
would be okay but when you have paid for lots of special effects, you
want the audience to see them I would assume. <br /><br />Overall, the film is mostly a few thoughts that are pieced together
with the flimsiest of threads. There is no explanation for why Raccoon
City has a wall all the way around it. The end of the movie is an
obvious attempt to set up another sequel but that is a sequel I hope is
never made if they cannot do a better job than this one.
