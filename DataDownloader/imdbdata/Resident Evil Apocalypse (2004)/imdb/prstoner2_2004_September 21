The original Resident Evil film was an excellent horror film - sexy,
scary, pulse pounding, and a refreshing breathe of life to the horror
film industry. <br /><br />Resident Evil Apocalypse was downright shameful. Nothing new, nothing
exciting, and above all nothing scary. The Nemesis character was wasted
in a few short scenes, too many subplots, and too much &quot;evil corporate
shenanigans&quot;. Where was the edge of my seat suspense the first one
created so well? This film looked more like two Hollywood-Hotties
dressed up in skimpy outfits shooting large weapons and doing some
heavy ass kicking of the undead - just to sell tickets to horny teenage
boys. <br /><br />The first film had a grim ending that could have opened up a killer
sequel....<br /><br />....the only thing this sequel did was kill my wallet by $7.50.<br /><br />(well actually $22.00 if you include my fianc&eacute;'s ticket plus
refreshments - but you get the point!)
