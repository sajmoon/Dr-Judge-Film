As you know in the 1st movie the T-Virus is unleashed and blah blah.
This movie shows us Raccoon. ^_^ The bigger problem here is that all
the teenagers like me who spent their whole childhood playing Resident
Evil think the 1st movie was.... different than we expected.
Disappointing. (Who the heck is Alice?) However I liked this 2nd movie
a lot... it's even my favorite movie! It has loads more elements of the
game, like Jill and Carlos, Ashford (that should be called Birkin)...
Talking about Ashford... He was the one who made me like the movie. I
think he's one of the best characters there since he's the &quot;vehicle&quot;.
Let's face it... without Ashford they would all be dead. Keep this in
mind when you go see the movie. So the problem here is that the &quot;hive&quot;
is reopened and the virus unleashes to the city. Umbrella immediately
tried to rescue their scientists, only, their high priority extraction
(Ashford, wheelchair high IQ scientist)) refuses to leave 'cause his
daughter is still at school. They go get his daughter but she has a car
crash. So she is trapped in the city. And then come all the other
characters. Ashford who is already outside the city, uses his
wheelchair laptop to help them (of course he makes a deal with them
that he only helps them if they rescue his daughter. And so on...
