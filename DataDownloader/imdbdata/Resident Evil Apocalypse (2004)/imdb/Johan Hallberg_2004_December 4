(Excuse me if my English's at bit rusty)<br /><br />I saw &quot;the Grand opening&quot; of Resident Evil :Apocalypse. There wasn't
much Grand about it...<br /><br />I'm a fan of the videogames, actually me and my friends loved the first
game so much that we almost cried every time we had too turn it of. I
also enjoyed the first movie. Most of it was true too the games and the
story wasn't that bad. It's the best video game-based movie ever made
at least. With this in mind I went too RE:Apocalypse with hope in my
heart. This was gonna be a good movie I said to my self. And I saw
it...I saw it and refused too admit that the movie was bad. Actually it
was terrible but I just couldn't admit it to my self. Until the next
morning. This movie REALLY stinks!! The story's a mess, the characters
unpersonal, the zombiescnes too few and the irritating onliners too
many. What really bugs me of is Nemesis. Nemesis should not have
computersight a l&aacute; Terminator, he shouldn't let anyone who's in his way
survive and he should not I repeat NOT ally with ANYBODY AT ANY TIME!
Nemesis should be a senseless killingmachine, nothing more nothing
less.<br /><br />Now, the movie may have some fun parts and some eye candy action
scenes(most of them filmed as if the cameraman had a epilepsy attack
while jumping on a trampoline) so if you're never have played the game
you might enjoy it. The special effects has improved a bit too but
still they aren't anything extraordinary. But if you're a Resident Evil
thinking that this movie may be OK because it's based on the
game...abandon that thought now.<br /><br />Too sum things up. If you see Resident Evil: Apocalypse as a braindead
actionmovie, you might enjoy it and see it again. If you see Reasident
Evil:Apocalypse as a fan of the games, bring a bucket and tissues.
You're gonna barf and cry so much it hurts. I did.
