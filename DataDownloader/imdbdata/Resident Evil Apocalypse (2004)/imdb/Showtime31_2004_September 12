I went to check out Resident Evil 2 this weekend I didn't think it was
going to be any good or any better than the first I was wrong. I
thought it was a great action-packed zombie movie I'm sure a lot of
fans of the video game are rather happy with the way the Resident Evil
series is turning out. From what I can remember all video game movie
suck Mario, House of the Dead etc..<br /><br />Overall the movie is cool Mike Epps is funny as hell in this movie I
didn't even know he was in it he really helped out a lot with the
laughs. If you are in the mood just to have fun and want to see hot
chicks kick some zombie ass go see this flick its worth the money.<br /><br />7/10
