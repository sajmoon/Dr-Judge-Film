The original Resident Evil movie was a big disappointment for me. I had
expected the movie to be more like the video game that I love so much.
The makers of the movie did a much better job on this sequel to try to
keep it true to the game.<br /><br />The movie takes place after the incident at the Hive. Alice awakens in
a lab belonging to the Umbrella Corporation. No one seems to be around,
Alice leaves the lab, venturing into Racoon City, only to find that the
nightmare is not yet over.<br /><br />This second film introduces Jill Valentine, who was in the video game
Resident Evil 2, as well as a few other characters. Being from the
Toronto area, it was great to see the city of Toronto used as the
backdrop of Racoon City. Numerous landmarks were used, and the
destruction of our City Hall was fun to see.<br /><br />Great special effects, lots of action, and a decent storyline put this
one above the other video-game movies. It is definitely not going to be
up for best picture, but it is a fun time waster. Just leave your brain
at the door, and you may find yourself enjoying this entertaining
horror/thriller.<br /><br />Looking forward to the third film, if they decide to make it. Hopefully
they will return to the mansion that was used in the first game.
