I went into this movie expecting something from the horror/action/video
game genre. I loved Underworld, the Village, etc. The plot was
entertaining, if a bit clich&eacute;d--but I was there for the entertainment
value. The ideas of conspiracy, cover up, and biowarfare were all
interesting ones.<br /><br />My major issue was with the large quantities of low frequency sound,
which was incredibly painful for someone with sensitive ears such as
myself. I had my fingers in my ears for half the movie and that didn't
help. If you think you will like this movie but have sensitive hearing,
don't see it in the theater like I did--rent it so you have control
over the volume and the length of the noise affecting your ears.
