This film is just so poor, and what is disappointing is that it had so
much potential. Like many other commentators have noted, it is true
that the cinematography is good - it has been executed expensively by
people who know what they are doing. The script not only lets the film
own, but is the hole that the the film falls ungracefully into. The
movie makers obviously wanted a sequel, but had no idea of how to
create one along the imaginative lines of the first film. What happens
to the sequel, is that it falls into &#x27;Dawn of the Dead&#x27; territory, and
desperately does not know how to get out of it, bar repeating various
scenes from the first film in mildly varying forms. The continuing
masculinsation of the female characters is tedious - although the fight
scenes are great. Milla continuously pops up at perfectly the right
time with the key equipment - be it a motorbike or a cigarette. This
film is so far removed from reality that it disappears up its own
removed rear, without ever truly capturing the imagination which a
fantasy feature simply has to do.
