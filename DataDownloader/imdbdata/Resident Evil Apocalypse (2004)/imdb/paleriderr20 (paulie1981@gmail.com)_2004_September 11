Resident Evil is an acquired taste. The first movie was split right
down the middle. Most people who played the game loved the movie and
most people that never played the game hated the movie. Resident Evil
Apocalypse was no different. I am a huge fan of the resident evil game
series and thought the first movie was a fairly solid action movie and
at the time was the best video game adaption. Apocalypse now takes the
crown as the champ. From the time this movie was announced I was
anticipating it. When the credits for the movie rolled I felt like a
kid again. The movie doesn't disappoint the hardcore fans and is even
enjoyable for a person looking for a solid action movie. The acting in
the movie was very well done. With Guillory shining as a fan favorite
Jill Valentine. The rest of the cast gave very convincing performances
especially Mike Epps as the comic relief. Most of the action was very
solid, besides the quick cutting fist fight between Alice and Nemesis.
The story structure was a lot better than the first. The pacing seem
more natural and the action was perfectly staged. My favorite part had
to be Nemesis. The make-up team did an excellent job to make true to
Capcom's creation. The ending was not predictable and will leave true
fans begging for the sequel. *** out of ****
