This has to be the worst 22 minutes of drivel I have ever clapped eyes
on. Yes that's right I could only stomach 22 minutes before my brain
imploded. Shocking, considering I managed to watch the entire 2 hour
torture of Battlefield Earth. Perhaps it's my age or something, but
watching this dog turd infuriated me. Note to the company who funded
this god awful film&#133;..GIVE THE BUDGET TO CHARITY NEXT TIME&#133;.sorry I
will stop ranting now. I have to somehow fill ten lines to get my
comment processed so here goes. The problem I have with this film is it
shows no intelligence what so ever, it is purely designed to cash in on
the ever size expanding, swearing, spitting and uneducated large
thumbed youths that litter the streets everywhere you go. Don't give
them anymore excuses to sit around and become blobs. I know this first
hand having tried to convince my 16 year old nephew to try playing
football; he lasted 5 minutes before collapsing in a heap.
