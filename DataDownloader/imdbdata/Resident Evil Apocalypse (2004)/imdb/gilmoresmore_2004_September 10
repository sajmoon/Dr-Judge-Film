Much better sequel to the original film that finally captures the
essence of the game and adds a sense of dread to the party as well.
Milla Jovovich gives a better performance this time around as Alice and
Oded Fehr is just as strong as well. The special effects are much
better as well as the cgi and the city setting is much creepier as
well. It still has some of the problems of the first film like a short
running time and weak plot development but the pros out weight the cons
by a mile here. The score is better produced and the cinematography has
more style here than the original. It still lacks the shock value of
the game but it does come close to capturing it as well. <br /><br />Bring on part 3.
