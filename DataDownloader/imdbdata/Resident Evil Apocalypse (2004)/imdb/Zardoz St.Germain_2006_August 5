People here get wayyyy too carried away with picking things apart. I
really thought that #1 sucked - I regretted seeing it... A friend
&quot;made&quot; me see #2 and I was delighted that he did - it was really good -
sooooo much better than the first. I have to ask if the people writing
here saw the same RE#1 that *I* did as it was so awful! Milla kicks
butt on screen and I really look forward to seeing RE#3.<br /><br />They did a lot more plot development here as well as action and F/X
sequences. The Alice character&#39;s individual development also makes a
big diff in the movie. <br /><br />Chill folks...
