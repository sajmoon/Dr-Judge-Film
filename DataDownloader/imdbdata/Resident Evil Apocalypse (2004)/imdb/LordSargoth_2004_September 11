As a fan of the Resident Evil games and the first movie, I couldn't
wait for RE:A to come out. To be honest, I did keep my expectations low
for this movie because it was using a number of familiar characters,
such as Jill and Carlos, and I was not sure if they would get them
right at all. Since my I didn't have high expectations, I can say I
enjoyed this movie, but if you're looking for a masterpiece, this is
not the movie for you.<br /><br />One of the worst things in this movie happens during a number of the
action scenes. The camera just flies around a whole lot, making
everything kind of blurry. Alice could have been flailing about for all
know and that may or may not have been a zombie she was hitting.
Another thing is the lack of plot in the beginning of the movie. It
picks up towards the middle, but it never gets very heavy. I'd say the
first movie did far better in the plot department.<br /><br />What it lacks in plot though, it makes up for by appealing to the
Resident Evil fan in me. Seeing Raccoon City on the big screen just
makes a part of me happy. Not only do you see the generic zombies,
dogs, and lickers, but you get Nemesis this time around too. The movie
has action from start to finish, although some scenes are sub-par,
others are just plain kickass. There's a lot of comedic relief in parts
of the movie too that had the theater laughing out loud. Also, I became
attached to a number of the characters, which is always a good thing in
a film or story.<br /><br />It won't be the movie of the year or probably even the season, but so
what? I enjoyed Resident Evil: Apocalypse and I think any fan of the
series or just someone looking for a good action film will enjoy it.
