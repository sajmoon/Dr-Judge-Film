I really enjoyed this movie. Zombie films are not exactly my forte, but
I find them very interesting, nonetheless. It combines the genres of
triller and action to make a interesting film. The cast includes Milla
Jovovich, returning from the first film, as Alice. She creates a sense
of feminine power with her character. Sienna Guillory appears as Jill
Valentine, from the game series. Oded Fehr plays Carlos Olivera, also
from the game series. I believe that if you enjoyed the first Resident
Evil, then you will like this one as well. That also goes to the fans
of the video game series. The special edition DVD that is out contains
interesting interviews with the cast and crew, looks behind the film
itself, and much more that film buffs will enjoy. I truly think of this
as a must- see.
