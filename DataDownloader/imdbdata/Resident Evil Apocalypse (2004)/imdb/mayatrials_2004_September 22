2004_September 22 

Saw half of it and I stopped cause I'm not sadomasochistic. If u are,
then go ahead and watch it. U'll enjoy bad directing, bad acting, bad
scripting..all in one place.It's so bad that I cant rate it with 1, I
would rather give it a -1. The story?..no comment, it's childish and
seen in all B and C class moviez. Special effects?...done poorly and
not with that touch that makes u grab the chair ur sitting in.
Suspense? Zero, nada, nix, zip. Characters in the movie? None that u
will remember after u see the movie. The lines in the script? Crappy
and played by second hand actors, no emotions, no expresivity, no
nothing, just robots talking their way out of the movie. Trying to make
Milla look like a bad ass killing machine fails miserably even from the
start in the church. The other girlie in the movie tries it too and
fails even more miserably than the first one. I don't know what was on
their mind, but the desire of making money pushes the producers in our
days in making these toxic wastes of cinematography. I can't even
believe that a person with an average IQ of 80-85 can watch this movie
and say at least...aa, yeah, it wasn't too much but it was OK. All I
can say is that it ruined all my evening, don't let it do the same to
you.
