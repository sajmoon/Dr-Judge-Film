Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a great film that has a good cast which
includes Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Thomas
Kretschmann, Sophie Vavasseur, Razaaq Adoti, and Matthew G. Taylor. The
acting by all of these actors is very good. Jovovich in My opinion had
one heck of a performance. She worked very hard fighting and handling
the weaponry. The zombies are filmed really cool! The RE characters
such as the Lickers and the zombie canines are cool. Nemesis is awesome
in this film! The movie is filmed very good. The music is outstanding
by Jeff Dana. I recommend that you stop by Amazon.com and buy the
score! The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you
going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film and I don;t
understand why this film didn't do well at the box office and now it
has a IMDb rating of 5.6/10. You got tons of great action, some RE
characters from the games, and whole lot more! What more could you
want? If you Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Thomas
Kretschmann, the rest of the cast in the film, Resident Evil video
games and the first film, Horror, Sci-Fi, Action, and interesting films
then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!
