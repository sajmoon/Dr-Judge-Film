With the original Resident Evil I thought &quot;Hmmmm, it could have been
better but still a great movie&quot;<br /><br />But with Resident Evil 2 I just felt after watching it... &quot;Hmmmm, they
have set the whole story up for just the last 5 minutes of the whole
movie to promote then next branch off of Resident Evil&quot;...<br /><br />I know they had to introduce these new characters like Jill Valentine,
Carlos Olivera, Angie Ashford and even have a recap of where Matt
was... But couldn't they have just plotted the story line just a bit
better so it doesn't feel like the whole movie was just about getting
to know them. With RE they focused on the Horror of being trapped with
the ever hungry living dead, This time it just focused on the Living
contaminated with the Virus and surviving on the anti-virus (Total
Yawn)...<br /><br />If they do have the next branch off (which I think would be extremely
good considering how they left the end of this movie) could they just
get the extreme advice from the creators of the Original game, and when
I say extreme I mean they should just write the whole movie and try to
live up to the expectations of Adoring Resident Evil Gamers all over
the world.
