Resident Evil Apocalypse is many things. Pick a profanity, the choice
is yours.<br /><br />But from a more &#39;creative&#39; perspective, Resident Evil Apocalypse is the
sequel to a film based on a video game franchise based on a film series
based on monsters based on humans.<br /><br />But that&#39;s what we like to see - rehashes, only bigger and louder and
faster, with bigger explosions, louder guns, and faster women.<br /><br />I could rant all day about video-game-to-screen conversions, the most
fundamental point being: in video game, the narrative is merely a
backdrop for the gameplay - whereas in film, the narrative is
paramount.<br /><br />The story of Resident Evil was cack, but we didn&#39;t really take note at
the time, busy as we were blatting our way through legions of the
undead and solving stupid puzzles. On the silver screen however, the
story is right out there in all it&#39;s nonsensical glory, only now the
characters are sassy clich&eacute;s, the zombies badly framed, and the
once-terrifying Nemesis a rubbery, scary-as-kittens parody of his
former self.<br /><br />Still, you can&#39;t go wrong with a huge budget and an already-eager
fanbase of teenage boys waiting to spend their cash to see zombies,
tits and explosions.<br /><br />But then, if there was no money in bastardising good ideas until every
shred of intelligence and originality has been sucked away, we wouldn&#39;t
have fast food.<br /><br />Or Big Brother.
