This movie was fun and entertained me. Had just enough of a story to
get you from scene to scene and as long as your fine with that.. this
action/sci fi film will be for you. Had scenes that were meant to be
tense and scary.. some may find them so while others will not. While it
lacked a lot of zombies it had enough to entertain but would have bee
nice to see a few heavily decayed ones. The effects were nice and the
Nemesis was done okay! If you like a action movie about a cover up
conspiracie with loads of over the top action scenes.. this is for you!
Pure pop corn eye candy that is worth a day time showing if nothing
else. <br /><br />7/10
