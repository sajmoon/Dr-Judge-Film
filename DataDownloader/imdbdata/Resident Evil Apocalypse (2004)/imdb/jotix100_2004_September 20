Director Alexander Witt and the writer, Paul W.S. Anderson have put
together an hour and a half of action that is so intense, the viewer
will have to stay glued to his seat to see how will this tale will end.<br /><br />Raccoon City will never be the same. The Umbrella Group has taken care
of changing everything with the deathly virus that spreads through the
city. Whatever you do, don't let anyone bite you: that will put you
into a zombie like state that will turn you into an individual that
thirsts for human blood. Hemophiliacs won't survive this attack!<br /><br />The ending tells us a new installment won't be too far in the future.
As long as films like this find an audience and make money in the
process, the saga of Raccoon City will continue. This film is not for
the weak hearted.
