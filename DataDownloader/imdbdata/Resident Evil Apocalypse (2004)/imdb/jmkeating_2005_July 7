Strange that they say Chernobyl is in Russia - In reality it's in the
Ukraine where Milla Jovovich was born (Kiev) Kiev is 100km south of
Chernobyl.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film - but I do not play games so know nothing of the RE
series.<br /><br />The ending was a bit obvious with the reference to the next film in the
series (to be made in 2006) - great.<br /><br />The only negative comments I would make are: 1. in the blurriness of
some of the action scenes - when you try to watch frame-by-frame
there's nothing to see. 2. at the end when she is regaining her memory
it looks like a re-run of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;
