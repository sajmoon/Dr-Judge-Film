I went to the cinemas to see resident evil apocalypse in at first a
fought it was a quite good start to the movie, but! until the movie
started to get half an hour into it!! it started to fall with the
zombies! and to be truly honest about the film it wasn't anything like
the video game with gore 'n' violence the film didn't show any gore 'n'
violence, it was a base of people getting attack by zombies and that
was it! there was no gore 'n' flesh eating well apart from a few bite's
which wasn't even gory! that was just all you could see in the film,
just a few bite's! so the film was a total and rubbish and the worst
zombie film ever made!!! i think they should get resident evil redone
again in make it very much like the video game &quot;expilicit gore and
violence with strong language, thats the way they should of done the
film just like the game and make it a certificate &quot;18&quot; not &quot;15&quot;!!! so i
would like to give resident evil apocalypse a very poor &quot;1 out of 10&quot;
is totally bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S start the film all over again in
make it just like the game.
