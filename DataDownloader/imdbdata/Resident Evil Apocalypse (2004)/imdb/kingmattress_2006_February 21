If it involves zombies, I have to see it. Love all the Res. Evil games,
and the first movie was great.<br /><br />This movie wasn't too bad. It was a fun action film that didn't have a
lot to it and didn't do anything terribly wrong. Nemesis was kind of
corny, but I could deal with him.<br /><br />Apocalypse picks up exactly where the first movie ended, which is
always a plus in my book. They brought this one closer to the game, as
Jill Valentine of Resident Evil 1 and 3 was a main character. Not a
redhead in the movie, as they already had a redhead in Jovovich's
Alice. The plot seemed mostly based on a combination of Resident Evil 3
and Resident Evil: Code Veronica. It involved the cover-up of the virus
incident by Umbrella, but included elements of survivors being hunted
by Nemesis while escaping. These two stories worked well together.<br /><br />My problem was that, because of this, the movie didn't focus enough of
the zombie battles, but instead took a turn to humans fighting each
other near the end. But all in all, a fun movie if you don't want to
think.
