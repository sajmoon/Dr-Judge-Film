I thought that since the film was going to have a huge mutant/cyborg
with a rocket launcher it would be pretty hard to make it suck..... but
guess what, they managed. The acting was pretty bad, nemesis is hardly
in it, the umbrella heavies seem to be wearing motorbike helmets and
the ending was bad and screams &quot;Resident evil 3, come waste even more
of your money!&quot; There was one or two good points but the rest of the
film cancels them out.<br /><br />Also what is Hollywood's problem with europeans, why are they always
the bad guys? i can only assume that since the cold wars over they've
no one else to paint as evil.<br /><br />What really annoys me is that this will make money regardless of how
bad it is.
