There's lot of action, zombies and special effects. Just the low budget
was the limit... Alexander Witt is not the perfect one to direct this
movie.<br /><br />Many action scenes are not very well done, one of the end fights is
just carbage (you can see just some close takes without real action!).
But the story is good, something what you have seen in Resident Evil
game series (nice and bloody story, weird story changes). I hope the
third one is good, macho, and include great RE atmosphere! Jovovich is
great, and the new chick is hot as well. And if you have played the RE
games, you can notice that the chicks are quite loyal for the &quot;spirit&quot;
of RE games series. RE: Apocalypse is nice and entertaining movie, but
first one were better. But the story of Apocalypse is better than first
ones story.
