2004_September 10 

I just saw this movie in my local cinema. To be honest, I didn't have
high expectations for Resident Evil: Apocalypse but I was pleasantly
surprised.<br /><br />One of the main reasons I didn't have that high of a expectation for
resident evil is because I really liked Resident Evil 1 a lot. I
especially like the open ending it complimented the computer game
perfectly. I was therefore surprised to see that a second movie was to
be made.<br /><br />I personally like how the first move was made, with provocative camera
angles great lighting etc. Resident evil 2 continues with the same
visual style and makes use of some of the new ideas other movies have
used since Resident Evil 1 was made. I think that they have found a
good balance between CGI, animatronics and classic special effect
makeup.<br /><br />Story wise Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse picks up where the original move
left us. We are first introduced to the new characters in this move and
then we see Milla Jovovich. The store is that the T-Virus has spread to
Racoon City and everybody has to flee out of the city before total
lockdown. Afterwards they will be on their own. <br /><br />Some of the things I didn't like about the story was the way Alice
meets the other main characters it seemed a bit too lucky. The last
thing I didn't like was the way the monster of the movie was made. It
looked way to computer-animated, and I have to agree with the guy on
the forum who says that it looks like the monster from the computer
game Doom3.<br /><br />Anyway I really liked the movie, it's a great continuation of the first
move. If you liked Resident Evil 1 you will most certainly like
Resident Evil Apocalypse. I therefore give it 8 out of 10
