My basic thoughts on the film are as follows: As a zombie/action movie,
it's decent and entertaining; however, it still lacks severely when
compared to the awesome Dawn of the Dead remake. As a movie based on a
pre-fabricated story and set of characters, it is utterly and
horrifyingly terrible. If you like the Resident Evil games, please try
and forget that, since it will only make you hurt. Severely. Characters
are completely changed. Why even keep the names? Subtracting the name
form the equation, the characters are, again, in possession of
room-temperature IQ's. &quot;We need more ammo,&quot; Jill gripes. Then she kills
at least twenty heavily-armed commandos and doesn't even glance at
their devastating and superior hardware. Ugh.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that my thoughts will not be dismissed as rabid
fandom. true, I like the games. I admit, it's a decent, perhaps even
above-average zombie/action movie. But please, please, take off the
Resident Evil name. Then I will go away. <br /><br />Thank you. &quot;Staaarrssssss...&quot; (translation: seriously, this is the best
you could do?)~ Nemesis
