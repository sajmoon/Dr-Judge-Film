If you felt the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; movie didn't quite capture the
atmosphere of the original game, you can sleep a little easier now.
&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; has EVERYTHING: from dark, creepy
graveyards, a Gothic cathedral and classic lorries in an &quot;Escape from
New York&quot;- style deserted city to a cigarette smoking Jill Valentine
and half naked hooker zombies. Although this sequel clearly had a much
bigger budget than the original film, director Alexander Witt has kept
it credible and didn't use digital technology to bombard your senses
and keep your mind of the lack of a decent storyline. Rather than
making you feel like you're watching a computer- made movie where
nothing seems real, the special effects help create a desolate and
panicky atmosphere with credible characters who struggle to survive in
a city that's infested with their undead compatriots, partially decayed
K-9s and other creepy lifeforms. The scene where one survivor has to go
up against a class of elementary school zombies is just terrifying.
Unlike the director of the &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; remake, Witt and
producer/ script writer Paul W.S. Anderson have opted not to follow in
the footsteps of the fast- moving &quot;28 Days Later&quot; zombies, but has
clearly been inspired not only by George Romero's view of walking
corpses, but also by his opinion of our western society. The real evil
in this movie is not the zombies or even the killer mutant Nemesis (who
looks and sounds like he has just stepped out of the original game and
into this movie), but a Big Brother- style multinational that puts
itself above the law and has no respect whatsoever for morale, decency
or anything human. Even if you've never played the video game, didn't
like the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; movie or don't care for a lot of high
tech military action in a horror film, I'd still highly recommend you
take the time to watch this one. If you liked both the 1978 version of
&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;, you're going to love &quot;Resident Evil:
Apocalypse&quot;. Besides, if internationally acclaimed Milla Jovovich
agreed to add it to her r&eacute;sum&eacute; of, among others, &quot;the Fifth Element&quot;,
&quot;the Messenger: the Story of Jean of Arc&quot; and &quot;the Million Dollar
Hotel&quot;, it has to be good!
