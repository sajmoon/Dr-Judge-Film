This movie has got to be one of my favorites since the Matrix trilogy
and the LOTR trilogy. It is amazing and it follows the Sony Playstation
games almost exactly. The details and the special effects are
spectacular and this is a must see for any of those who love zombie
movies. It kicks the crap out of Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days later
although those are both good as well. There is something about Milla
Jovovich that makes her a great as the part of Alice and Jill is also
amazing. The best part of the movie has to be the incredible detail to
make Nemisis look like he does in the game and how the storyline
follows so closely. Sony and Screen Gems pictures need to get a pat on
the back as I would definitely give this movie two thumbs up!!!
