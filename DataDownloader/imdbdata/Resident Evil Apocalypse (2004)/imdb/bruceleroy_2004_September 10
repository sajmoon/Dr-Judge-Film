This &quot;film&quot; officially supplants House of the Dead as the worst horror
movie of all time. Sure, there has been some low-budget,
straight-to-video junk, but I cut them some slack due to budgetary
constraints. RE2 obviously has no shortage of money, so it has no
excuse for being such a piece of garbage.<br /><br />Those who think Paul Anderson is such a hack director should realize
how competent he is comparing the first RE to this hatchet job by
first-time director Alexander Witt. He has no clue how to direct
action, as everything is done with quick cuts and shaky camera work, as
if he doesn't want us to see how bad the action is (he succeeds). He
also obviously is no zombie fan, as he takes the soul out of the movie
by minimizing the zombie content in favor of guns, kung fu, and every
other bad Hollywood action movie clich&eacute; out there. What zombie footage
there is is nullified by bad camera work and an ultra-annoying slow
motion/strobing effect that obscures the zombies. Plus, there isn't
even a lot of gore. The general story idea is OK, but it takes some
stupid turns, and the dialogue sounds like it was written by a 8 year
old. People who make movies based on video games need to realize that
the two genres are different; movies require more substance than games.
I've haven't played the RE games much, so I don't know how much is
included in this movie, but you don't have to throw in every
over-the-top element from the game. I don't care about zombie dogs (I
overlooked it in the first movie) or all of the characters, who are in
fact ridiculous caricatures (what's with the Lara Croft chick?). And
who wants to see a zombie with a rocket launcher??? I love zombie
movies, but I'd prefer to have no more made than to have any more like
this one. I wouldn't even call it a zombie movie (barely even a horror
movie); just a standard action movie made for 10 year olds with ADD
that just happens to have some zombies.
