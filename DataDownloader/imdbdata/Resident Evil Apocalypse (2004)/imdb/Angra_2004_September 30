I didn't care much for either RE movies. Its like the directors only
are inspired by the action part of the game and not the brilliantly
creepy atmosphere that I loved so much. Where is the part where our
heroes walks alone in a giant scary mansion trying to survive all kinds
of horrors, like they do in the first 3 games? NOWHERE!!! Its like the
style of both movies are inspired by the fourth and least creepy game,
&quot;Codename Veronica&quot; , with the exception of the Terminator like mutant
zombie in RE:Apocalypse, that obviously is taken from the third game
&quot;Nemesis&quot;, and with success. It looks much like the mutant in the game
and he also acts the same way.<br /><br />But what i find really annoying, especially with RE:Apocalypse, is the
marvel comic action that the movies are packed with. I didn't get the
feeling, while playing the games, that the heroes were SUPER heroes,
but i certainly do that when I'm watching the movies. It takes out all
the suspense and horror (which leave only action) when Jovovich fires a
one-liner, while hanging in the air kicking 5 zombies to &quot;death&quot; at the
same time. And the worst part is, that ALL heroes in RE:Apocalypse are
like that. Its just as scary to look at as watching &quot;X-men&quot;. Jovovichs
arrival in the church says all that i feel about especially this
sequel. Laughable and ridiculous.<br /><br />Now i can only look forward to the cinema versions of &quot;Silent Hill&quot; and
&quot;Fatal Frame&quot; and hope that they wont be ruined as much as Resident
Evil was.<br /><br />I'm sure that when the second sequel to Resident Evil comes up i
wouldn't be surprised if Jovovich learns how to fly... Yikes!<br /><br />I gave it 3 out of 10
