Well first of all I'm a big fan of the Residen Evil games, just to know
the fact. I was very delighted when I heard that the Resident Evil
movie is about to be filmed but then, when I saw first part I was
pretty much disappointed. When I heard that there will be a sequel to
to that movie I thought that they can do it worse. But, I was wrong.
This movie is WORST action movie ever made, stupidest even than Tomb
Raider 2. Not scary at all, plot is ridiculous, acting too. Worst of
all is Kung Fu fights, why they needed that for ? Why, why, why ?!?!?
This movie is supposed to be like Alien or Predator but definitively
not like this. My rate 0/10, ahh, I must give it 1/10, but it's
undeserved.
