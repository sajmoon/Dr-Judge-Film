As with the last Resident Evil, this is what I can only describe as a
salvage movie. I guess they followed a menu that went something like
this:<br /><br />1. Start with a really basic script 2. Take all sorts of characters,
sets and situations from other movies and stick them in where you can
3. Add some R-rated sex scenes for good measure<br /><br />Lets see if any movie buffs can spot more than I did: Lara Croft (easy
one), Barbarella (scene in school ), Dawn of the dead (take your pick),
Equilibrium (the guards), Starship Troopers (must have used the same
water healing container thing), Hellraiser + Terminator (kill 2 birds
with one stone), Scanners (easy one again), James Bond (tower
walkdown), Omega Man (crash) after that I got bored thinking about it.<br /><br />The worst thing, apart from the mediocre acting, the disjointed
story-line, and the half-baked direction (to name but a few) was how
they tried to stretch it out to fill the time. I would say half way
through making the movie they probably realized they couldn't fill more
than 60minutes with this junk and what about a sequel? So they spliced
in another 15 painful minutes or so of totally disjointed story-line so
they could leave the ending open.<br /><br />Best thing about this movie, Sienna Guillory. She can come arrest me
anytime. Grrrrrrrrr!
