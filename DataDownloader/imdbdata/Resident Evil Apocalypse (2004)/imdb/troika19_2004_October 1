Well after reading about 35,000 complaints about Resident Evil
Apocalypse I was expecting a total stinker just as I was expecting
going into the first movie but thankfully yet again I was wrong and
really enjoyed it.<br /><br />It's no masterpiece but then again no Zombie flick is imo (even the
original Dawn of the Dead is a very over rated movie imo) and what were
the critics expecting?, an Oscar winner or something?, come on be real
it's a Zombie flick not a period drama.<br /><br />If You are looking for a deep plot with awesome character development
then stay away, if on the other hand You are just looking for 90
minutes of pure action then this is the movie for You, My only real
complaint was the ending with annoyed Me for some reason but other then
that a solid 7/10 from Me.
