I think I'm about three fifths of the way through this discombobulated,
mish-mash of a sci-fi/schlock jock escapade into stupidity...I have
seriously never seen a movie make such little sense. Perhaps because
it's based on a video game that itself is based on some bizarre
pedophiliac, masturbatory death orgy of zombies and sex. My favorite
part is how every time a zombie is shown, the action gets all slo-mo to
disguise the fact that the makeup team behind this movie couldn't paint
a clown for a 6 year olds birthday party. Dialogue: Total crap Action:
Let's just blow everything up and show computers Story line: Is there
one? That 'Nemesis' thing is the only halfway decent character in the
whole pile of horse pucky... and he's hotter than that disgustingly
putrid looking girl who carries around her camera hoping for an Emmy.
And how stereotypical for the &quot;funny urban black guy&quot; to be all zany
and wacky and, somehow, still humorous in light of an entire city gone
retarded. But hey, I blame it all on my wonderful fianc&eacute; who thought
that RE and RE2 for $25 at Best buy was a DEAL...she likes 'strong
female characters.' Yes they are strong. But speaking of stereotypical,
why are they also beautiful, big breasted and white? This movie sucks.
