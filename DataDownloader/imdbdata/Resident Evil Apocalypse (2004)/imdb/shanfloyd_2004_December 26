I read many times in several reviews that fans of the game series would
love this film. I can't see why. One cannot create that 'survival
horror' environment into such films (don't bring '28 days later' in
comparison) and thus one, a fan of the games or not, should watch this
film keeping no presumptions in mind. I was disappointed in doing that.<br /><br />The prequel had a provocative ending, giving rise to several
interesting possible ideas in my mind, thanks to the fact that I'm an
avid fan of the games myself. But little could I predict about this
noisy, baseless, cheap action extravaganza. There are only characters
taken from the game, nothing else. The premise was good, but the
results aren't. Introduction of Nemesis could have been avoided,
because he is simply wasted here. Most of the action sequences come
suddenly, without any link to the story. And to tell the truth, there
is no 'story' involved, just an excuse.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is not as spicy as she was in the first movie. Sienna
Guillory as Jill is good. Perhaps she is one thing that perfectly
matches with the game. The other characters are not worth mentioning.
There are some good moments in the film, like the ending, or the
incident in the school, but all over I think the first one was better.
The movie leaves a chance for a third part, I am not sure if that's a
good thing for us.<br /><br />The bottomline: watching it in a theatre is inadvisable. The DVD should
come out soon. Rent and watch. We've got better things to buy.
