Rewritten on: 10.9.06 <br /><br />As far as sequels go, RE: Apocalypse does not quite live up to its
predecessor but definitely makes the effort to tell a story in an
exciting way. I may sound rather ignorant saying this, but I do
consider action a rather safe genre. Remember that this is not a
horror-film nor really a zombie-film but an action film...with zombies.<br /><br />Where the plot may be lacking it rather well mirrors that of the games.
The main-reason I like this movie is the characters. The over-all look
of the film is also something I enjoyed though it wasn&#39;t quite as
impressive as the cold visual appearance of the first film. Musically
the film unfortunately did not have the same level of electronic
ominous presence as the first.<br /><br />One of my favorite elements in this film is Nememsis. He has a
bizarrely demanding presence. I also thought it was kinda cute how they
tied up the loose end from the last film with him.<br /><br />While it is nowhere as good as its predecessor the film is definitely
watchable, its stunts and visual effects work brilliantly and the movie
assures that the viewer will never have a dull moment.<br /><br />Hardcore RE fans however, don&#39;t bother.
