I've seen this recently and I must say it was a bit of an improvement
but not that good, because was too much action and face-paced thriller
than horror, at least they put a few lickers, and perhaps the only
things I found worthwhile in this movie is that it had some characters
similar to the ones in the game, it had Nemesis(except he also had a
chain-gun), and it had Jill Valentinte, Carlos, Nikolai, but Ashford
was a bit different. And at least Nemesis was almost the same as he was
in the game, but my complaints are also that Nemesis was a bit of the
hero at the end and that other STARS members like Chris, Barry,
Rebecca, Brad, and Wesker weren't in it, and there weren't enough
monsters and they didn't deliver enough fear. But overall it was okay
as a sequel but lousy as an adaption and horror.
