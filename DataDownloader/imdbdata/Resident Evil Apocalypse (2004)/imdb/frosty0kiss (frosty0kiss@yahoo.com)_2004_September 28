I seriosuly think this movie kicked ass. Like, I want to be Alice.
Hahah, no j/k, I'm not crazy. Anyways it was better than the first one
and I can't get enough of it. My favorite part I think was...when she
woke up in the lab and busted out after f-ing up that doctor. And the
funniest part was when the zombie strippers made LJ crash, like the
whole theater was laughing. I was wicked sad that Matt was turned into
an evil Nemesis guy and died, it was sad....=( And how did Alice do
that thing at the end with the camera security guy? Anyways I went to
see it twice in the theater, I can't wait till the DVD comes out. And I
really really really hope the third one is produced,even though it wont
be in theaters for two years, its something to look forward too! Anyone
know anything about it?
