The game is great because you follow a single characters attempt for
survival. The character is not a superhero (Alice), but is a human and
therefore we relate to her feelings more. The film annoyed me because
we follow several characters at once. I would of much preferred to
follow the journey of perhaps 2 characters, to bring back the essential
survival element. <br /><br />The zombies were unbelievably crap. They clearly targeted this game at
young teens (who would rather watch gory, sick and disturbing zombies
anyway). Another indication of this was the cheesy rock music and 'kick
ass' scenes. <br /><br />If they had actually tried to make this film frigging scary, it would
of been so much more successful. And why did they desert the creepy
mansions? The settings in the games were so important in making it
scary, which was completely ignored in the films. <br /><br />Imagine being in the cinema, watching this bloke/girl walking around in
this big twisted mansion, encountering or hearing these foul zombies.
Well use your imagination, I'm sure those that have played the game
kinda know what i mean.<br /><br />It had potential. It could of been the scariest thing ever. Instead it
was a purely made to make money and the director blew the chance to
turn a fantastic game into a cool film. He probably didn't even play
the game. Idiot.
