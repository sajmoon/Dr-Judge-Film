I could not seem to figure out why everyone was bashing this movie, but
then it hit me. Most people went in to this movie with expectations
that were entirely too high or they went to go see this movie with the
idea in their head that they were not gonna like the it no matter what.
Look, do not listen to the people that are saying this is the best
movie this year by far, because it is not. The acting was a little
suspect and there were a few unexplained events in the movie. But at
the same time, do not listen to the people who are screaming about how
this movie is the most stupid movie they have ever seen because that is
also not true. This movie is action packed from beginning to the end
and there is no denying that. <br /><br />Now as a fan of the Resident Evil video games, I must admit that I was
a little disappointed about the story line and the characters not
exactly matching up with their video game counterparts. But for
goodness sakes people, it's really not that serious so I went in there
and enjoyed the movie for what it is....a pretty good action movie.<br /><br />I give it 8/10.
