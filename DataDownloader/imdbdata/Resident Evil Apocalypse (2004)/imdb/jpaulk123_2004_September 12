OK...<br /><br />Here we go..... Read all of the comments here, because I knew that
those Bravo Channel film critics would slice it up. That is how I
decided to go or not. Saw this film based on the fact that I am a fan
of the Game, (I am much older than you think)and that some of you
objected to the scathing reviews it received.<br /><br />Well I went for the mindless entertainment and no high expectations. I
enjoyed this film on several merits. I also heard some of the most
ridiculous fight scene lines in history.<br /><br />The Plus: Friggin' Nemesis, they did it right with his look and feel,
and I mean spot on! He looks small in some of the film spots, but not
up close! He stole this movie and I wanted to see more of him.<br /><br />Friggin' Milla, they juiced her up to hang with all of the latest, and
unbelievable I might add, gymnastic moves that seem to frequent the
outlandish Hollywood fare that exists today. Still, I liked her a bunch
and pulled for her exploits.<br /><br />Jill's opening scene was fab.<br /><br />I keep hoping for a &quot;seamless CGI&quot; Tyrant to get the roll call in these
movies but that hasn't happened yet. But I wouldn't mind seeing Nemesis
again with those FAVORITE WEAPONS of mine!<br /><br />The rest of the cast was passable, on the D+ side of acting....LOL<br /><br />Minuses: Those Zombies en masse in the streets, was a slap in the face
of the viewer.....Or...The director did that on purpose, for multiple
viewings for DVD players, so that you could see how RIDICULOUS each one
carried themselves!!! Roger Ebert said, &quot;They looked like drunk movie
patrons, slogging through slushee laden floors to get to the concession
stand.&quot; I agree. Each one of those zombies wanted to stand out for his
15 minutes of fame to show his friends where he was in that pile!<br /><br />Terrible effect for movie-goers though........<br /><br />This picture will elicit &quot;audience shouting&quot; at this film, because of
the certain portions of this film that climbs all over your
intelligence, even when your intelligence is NOT IN GEAR! Plan on this
happening.<br /><br />Did I like this movie? Yes, I did....But I feel that I am adding bias
to a sample of reviewers here that either liked the games or never
played them. As a fan of the GAME, I KNOW what I wanted out of an RE
Film, and I got what mattered most! Nemesis, Milla and some stunning
action sequences. They got the &quot;sounds&quot; right too, so props to the
sound fx guys at work here. Nemesis' Gatling Gun is the best...<br /><br />Our theater did have the Volume up full blast with our BRAND NEW
Surround System employed...Whew....Ears are still ringing!<br /><br />Catch the Matin&eacute;e or wait for DVD, it doesn't matter. Except Nemesis is
at his biggest on the big screen! <br /><br />You decide......
