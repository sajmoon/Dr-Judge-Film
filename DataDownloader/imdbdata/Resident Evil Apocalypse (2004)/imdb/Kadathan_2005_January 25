2005_January 25 
To start, I've watched and enjoyed the first RE movie, and while it
wasn't among my list of -good- movies, it was worth watching.<br /><br />As well, I've played every single resident evil game made so far...eh,
sad, but I love them.<br /><br />And having seen this movie, I have to say, please do NOT make another
one....Not only did they butcher the story in both the former games and
movie, they(movie creators) actually managed to make me, someone who
played the games plenty for one lifetime, embarrassed. I cannot for the
life of me think how ANYone could enjoy the extremely over elaborate
fight scenes, the bad music, the complete lack of anything resembling a
script, and I would go so far to say the lack of character development,
except there weren't any characters.<br /><br />The ONLY things similar with this movie and the series are the names.
Nothing else...just wanted to clear that up. I've been thoroughly
disappointed with this movie, and while I ask that another not be made,
if it is I will go see it, if not out of hopes that it might actually
be worth 90 minutes of my already misused time, then just to see what
else they can manage to destroy about the series I know and love so
much.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me from leaving the theater was the fact that
I would stand out to the other movie goers and they would know I in
fact was there.<br /><br />This is a movie better left on the shelf, and I will be shaking my head
in sadness when I enter a video rental store and see the little rented
tag on this movie, knowing that someone, somewhere, just spent 4.50 to
effectively kill 90 minutes of their life.<br /><br />It gets a 2....While I can't think of how they could have made it
worse, I eagerly await the next riveting edition to find out.
