Hey wow, I really enjoyed this movie. After finally watching the first
one I jumped at the chance to watch this one. Before going, however, I
did hear some negative feedback from a friend who had talked to
somebody who had seen it on the day of release. We discussed it a bit
and so I was a little bit scared it would be lame and rather sure it
wouldn't be great.<br /><br />Considering how the last one left off, this movie has a bumpy
beginning. They couldn't exactly show the same 10 minute ending; plus
they had to introduce new characters etc. The result was OK but
somewhat lacking.<br /><br />Beyond the opening, this movie wasn't nearly as much about zombies as
the first one was. By the movie's climax, I was so focused on what else
was happening that my mind did a doubletake when the hoards reappeared.
&quot;Oh yeah, that's right, I forgot&quot; my mind said to myself. Rather than
the focusing on &quot;THE ZOMBIE&quot;, Resident Evil: Apocalypse focuses far
more upon &quot;THE VIRUS&quot;. Zombies are just an unfortunate side item of
what is actually important to everyone. Maybe this is a good thing and
maybe not. I liked it. The name is Resident Evil after all, not
Resident Zombie.<br /><br />The movie continues the ruthless violent killing in the manor of the
first one. There isn't anything slow about it. This &quot;manor of fact&quot; way
of approaching death is a fantastic. I'll never forget my Sister's face
when her favorite character was killed off within the first quarter of
the film#1. It leaves you all the more freaked out and on the edge of
your seat.<br /><br />There were a couple of cheesy parts. The big fight scene wasn't
something I'll always treasure but I really enjoyed the overall effect
the movie had on me.<br /><br />The end of this movie was very bizarre and I've read it had a tacked-on
feel. I supposed this is true but the movie was better for it. Even if
there never was another sequel I'd still like the ending, just as I did
the first one.
