I thought this movie was magnificent. It focused on how Umbrella dealt
with the infection in it's sick way. It focused on why the T-Virus was
created and who created it and who it was created for. It was gored
action packed. Plus the fact that most of the actors did most of their
own stunts is amazing and well appreciated and respected. It is also
the first movie in history to have a helicopter gun used by the
Nemisis. I believe this is an excellent movie and fully recommend it to
all horror sci-fi fans. I feel all resident evil gamers,like myself,
will be pleased with the outcome of this movie as they were with the
first movie. The ending is open-ended, which I think is great cause it
again leaves us with all sorts of questions, which leads on to RE:3.
