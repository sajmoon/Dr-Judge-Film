2004_September 11 

First off, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But with that
said, I honestly thought this movie was fairly pathetic (and I'm a fan
of the game).<br /><br />The first movie was 'ok' at best, and this was certainly a step down.
This movie manages to do all of the following: over-the-top action
sequences (the church scene was just too much..), sketchy special
effects (except for Nemesis; they got him dead on), half-decent acting.
And to top it off, they manage to skewer the movie line even further
from the the damn games these movies were supposed to be based from. I
could say more, but that would just be ranting. Save your 6-9 bucks and
catch this one on HBO.
