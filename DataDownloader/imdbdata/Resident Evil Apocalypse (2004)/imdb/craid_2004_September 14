1st off ... whats wrong with people ... if you don't like watching
zombiemovie then DON'T WATCH A ZOMBIEMOVIE!!! <br /><br />Anyway - This is an absolute masterpiece. It truly brings on the spirit
from the hardcore, badass marines vs. the apparently innocent and
pureharded civilians - which of course (without spoiling it too much
for u :-P) dosn't exactly turn out that way. The whole idea of making a
movie over the games, sounded like a - well really hard thing to do
well when they started making the first movie - and there was a few
things in the first movie that could have made it better but hay ... as
long as the sequel is basically the next chapter (almost like in LotR),
its OK. Great movie.<br /><br />Now to the bad stuff... 1. The nemesis monster is not the greatest
monster ever... i personally thought it to be a little too ... well ...
small and stiff in its movement. - but its minigun makes up for most of
that :-P but seriously ... that suit looks like its borrowed from some
90's B-horror-movie's props. 2. ... The graveyard scene ........ i was
like &quot;HMMMMM ... how the HELL (hehe well that ain't even a curseword in
relations to this movie :-P) did the dead get infected .... incapsuled
in like &frac12; a ton of dirt...???&quot;<br /><br />3. The scientist in the wheelchair ... he hacks ... and makes a logon
name that actually contains the word &quot;hack&quot;.... OK sorry but that would
be VERY unlikely don't u think ... a topoftheworld scientist is smarter
than a damn hick who thinks his pickup-truck can fit through his front
door... THINK PPL THINK!<br /><br />well ... 1 and 3 are some ... well ... minor and not all that important
mistakes. so ... with the exception of the HUGE blunder in 2, id say
the movie is next to perfect. 8&frac12;/10 from me, but since i cant pick
that, ill round it up ... on account of the nudity :-P
