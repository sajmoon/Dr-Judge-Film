i thought this movie was way over the top. it started off OK with the
opening when the people go to the hive to find out what happened. it
was still OK when they go to the church and are fighting off the
zombies and the licker creatures. but the movie got over the top near
the end, when Alice was fighting Nemisis, it got too over the top
because she was fighting some massive monster with rocket launchers and
a mini gun, which seemed as if it was over the top. then after the
fight when they go on the plane and fly away, the movie should have
ended when they crashed. overall it was a decent movie but it seems as
though the director was trying too hard,
