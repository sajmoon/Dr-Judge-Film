This movie is a wretched excuse for entertainment.<br /><br />A bare bones plot (less a plot than just a bunch of stuff happening)
laughably bad acting (not that the actors were given anything to work
with.. the dialogue is atrocious), shaky cam, badly edited fight scenes
that were incomprehensible, Stupid motivations, red-shirt characters,
one racial stereotype and scares that you could see a mile away.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't jump once but I sure yawned a number of times. Turn
off your brain, and enjoy the explosions if you want to survive this
artistic turkey that will leave you wondering how a movie could still
call itself a movie without the above necessary elements.<br /><br />a 3 year old could write a better film than this, but as an example of
Paul W.S. Andersons usual authorship, it's about on par with Alien vs.
Predator.. maybe even more lame.
