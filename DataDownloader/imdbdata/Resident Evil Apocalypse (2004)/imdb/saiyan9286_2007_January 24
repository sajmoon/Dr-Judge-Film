Go figure, I first saw this movie on 9 / 11 ... what an omen ! Anyway,
onto the movie. Here is what I liked about this movie. There are some
elements to the game that they put into the movie, such as the shootout
during the outbreak between the Raccoon City Police Department and the
U.B.C.S. vs the Zombies. It was a great action sequence. The scares
were pretty good. Mike Epps made the movie more fun for me ! My
favorite line &quot;Shoulda told&#39; me you got bit, mother f***er. I&#39;m all
hanging with you and s**t !&quot; Here&#39;s what I didn&#39;t like about the movie.
When it comes to characters, the movie really didn&#39;t follow the game
much. For instance, (now I am not being a sexist) Jill Valentine
(Sienna Guillory) isn&#39;t supposed to be all that tough, Carlos Oliviera
(Oded Fehr) is supposed to be a cocky &quot;ladies&#39; man,&quot; Nicholai (Zack
Ward) is supposed to be a bad guy, and Nemesis (coulda been bigger) was
specifically created to destroy only S.T.A.R.S. members. And speaking
of S.T.A.R.S., there aren&#39;t supposed to be THAT many S.T.A.R.S.
members.<br /><br />Overall, this was a really great film (can&#39;t wait for Part 3), though
it would&#39;ve been better if they followed the game a little more.
