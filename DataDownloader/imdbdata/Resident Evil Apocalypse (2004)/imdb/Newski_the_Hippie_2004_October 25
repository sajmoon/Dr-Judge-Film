I really hated this movie. And I mean hated. I have disliked movies
before, but only for this one did I actually ask for my money back.
Apparently, you can't get refunds for a bad movie. Fine. Just give me
back my lost braincells.<br /><br />The film starts where the last one ended. Of course, its supposed to. I
mean, its a sequel right? I am so glad to have seen 28 Days Later,
which proved to me horror wasn't dead. And I think Paul W.S. Anderson
saw it too, and realized that he didn't succeed in killing horror so he
penned this film. Anyway, lets get to the film.<br /><br />Here is the plot: Zombies get shot. And two superweapons fight to the
death. But there is more, right? Perhaps some interesting characters?
Well, we have a loose cannon cop. A good cop. A witty black guy. A
woman on the edge of sanity. And a creepy little girl. Yes, its a
mixing of the same characters we have seen over and over again.<br /><br />The ultimate confrontation, without spoiling it, is a joke. I think we
all saw it coming too. Anyone who has seen a movie before can guess it.
But of course, this is a movie that has the line &quot;It would be better if
we split up.&quot;<br /><br />This is a horror movie that is not scary. And an action movie that is
not exciting. Its for people who are too smart and want to get rid of
some of their excess intelligence.
