I had waited quite a long time to see this movie. I was very pleased to
be the first person on the island to see it. However, there were some
gripes I had that obviously bugged me a little bit. <br /><br />In RE: Nemesis, Nikoli was this war vet but in &quot;RE:A&quot;, he was played by
Zack Ward! The guy who played Christopher Titus's brother in &quot;Titus&quot;!
Another was the chemistry between Alice and Carlos Olivera. In RE:N,
there was more of that with him and Jill. And by the way, I loved how
they made exact replicas of Jill Valentine and Nemesis. Nice work!<br /><br />All and all, I do believe that long time fans of the Resident Evil
series the game and movie would have been somewhat satisfied with this
sequel. I also love the fact that Alice (Milla Jovovich) has a lot more
fighting in this movie. The only thing that really ticked me off was
that we never really got to see any of it! They over used the quick
camera editing so much that it made it kind of hard to tell who was
beating who!<br /><br />And finally, what I love the most about this movie is the ending. I
know I wasn't the only one in the theater who saw the ending in the
first one and had their jaw drop! The creators of the second movie
realized that the ending in the first one was absolute genius and had
the same feeling given to the ending of Apocalypse. I just hope that
when and if they do decide to do a third, characters including Claire
and Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy get added. So, for a score out of
ten, I give this movie 8 out of 10.
