After a zombie outbreak, the corporation Umbrella beings a cover up by
releasing the deadly creature Nemesis.<br /><br />I enjoyed its predecessor and was glad that the unjustly criticised
Paul W.S. Anderson was writing the sequel. However it was just a shame
that he didn&#x27;t direct the flow up. Either there was budget cut or
Alexander Witt wasn&#x27;t capable of delivering the cashing-in follow-on.<br /><br />Mike Epps is funny, but unnecessary comic relief and Iain Glen as the
&#x27;evil scientist&#x27; Dr. Isaacs gives a good performance. There is amazing
stunt work, Milla again plays heroine Alice superbly and Oded Fehr is
on top-form, however, there are lots of problems&#x85; The film is let down
by its TV feel, the zombies are ruined by blurry manipulated camera
work. Sienna Guillory is handed a dreadful script and costume. The
effects and music are a mixed bag, sometimes great and at other times
sadly distracting.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a sci-fi with plenty of action, but Apocalypse lacks the suspense,
atmosphere and finesse of the first instalment.
