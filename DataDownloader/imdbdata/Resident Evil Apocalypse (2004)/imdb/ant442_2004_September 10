2004_September 10 

First off, I didn't mind the first one, even though I wished that it
had more blood and gore in it. Don't expect any more in this
installment. I didn't like the twist that they have given the RE
storyline with alice being infected and given matrix like powers. It
seems like when there is a female lead in this types of movies, they
are so over-the-top in their toughness it seems too unbelievable and
makes them less sympathetic and likable characters. Jill Valentine and
Alice fit right into this category well. Overall, the movie is what you
can expect from a video game based movie and has not improved from the
first one. Don't waste your time on this movie when movies like 28 days
later, shaun of the dead, and the re-make of dawn of the dead are
available.
