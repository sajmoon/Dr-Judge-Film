Resident Evil 2 was much better then the 1st(I think). There is a
better plot, a lot more fighting, and there was some funny parts in the
movie too. Unlike the 1st movie there is more things happening and more
people. If you play the game you will see some scenes from the game are
in the movie, you might like that, I know I do. I think they spent more
time making the 2nd movie for the resident evil game fans, but even if
you don't play the games I think you will enjoy the movie and
understand what is happening more then the 1st movie. I didn't get to
see the movie in theaters but I wish I did. I love the resident evil
games, and I think this movie was great.
