Resident Evil Apocalypse is action packed but flawed from director
Alexander Witt whose admirable in making this sequel but the lack of
character development, too many characters, real suspense, and a more
central villain are what weighed it down. The cast for the most part
are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Oded
Fehr, Thomas Kretchman, Jared Harris, and Mike Epps. The rest of the
cast are okay in their small roles of characters from the games who
only make brief extended appearances before being written out out of
the movie too soon for the audience to care about them. The action is
pretty much non sop and impressive but after a while it gets to but a
bit repetitive. The only one that really stands out is probably the one
near the end which is well executed. The special effects and the make
up artists have done a great job of creating the creatures including
the zombies, dogs, Lickers, and the newest one introduced known as
Nemesis who was actually Matt from the original. He mutated into
Nemesis after being scratched by the Licker near the end of the first
film. The Nemesis character is intimidating but he lacked screen time
since there are other villains in this movie besides him. His showdown
with Jovovich near the conclusion is a bit of a letdown like the third
movie but it was fitting for that film. Despite some flaws with
character development, suspense, and the movie juggling too many
characters this sequel isn&#x27;t that bad. Overall Resident Evil Apocalypse
is a decent sci-fi thriller with plenty of action, amazing special
effects, some suspense, humor, and good performances by the cast who
make this second film in the series worth watching but it could&#x27;ve been
better.
