Come on! Jill, Nicholai and Carlos hardly had a main part in the whole
film, it was all about Alice...<br /><br />She beat up Nemisis!!! The main boss in Resi 3!<br /><br />She even ran down a skyscraper and killed a guy using her &quot;mind powers&quot;<br /><br />Apart from that...<br /><br />I enjoyed the film, although it did seem a little on the short side,
even though it was a good hour and a half.<br /><br />Seeing all the scenes of the RPD's last stand were like the games, and
it was good to see the director and writer copied almost every scene
from all the games.
