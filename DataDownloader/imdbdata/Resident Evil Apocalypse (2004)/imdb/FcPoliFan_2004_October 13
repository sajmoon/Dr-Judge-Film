As time goes by, everyone becomes wiser, or at least the saying says
so. These sequels, always such intricate matters! Especially if you
think you're a smart bastard and don't bother appreciating the work of
others, who actually facilitated you're &quot;creation&quot;. Most will probably
agree that Anderson is a terrible screenwriter, lacking creativity and
originality. But when you give up on a film to wreck another, I can't
but ask myself how that looks in the eyes of a professional. It doesn't
look too good in my eyes. Actually it proves lack of interest. I guess
all have their priorities, don't they?<br /><br />RE:Apocalypse is a film like few other: little to nothing dialogue,
zero character development, endless fight scenes. But is that really
bad? It definitely isn't great, however, if you take into account the
intention of the creators, you have to agree it fulfills its purposes,
but not its potential. I regret that no one bothered to add some depth
to the movie because it would've rocked, especially if there had been
some time to breathe without hearing a few bullets swoop by. A bit of
mystery and a bit of suspense, would've made this here creation a real
killer. Sadly, though, P.A doesn't bother that much and simply relies
on other people and films to do the job for him. <br /><br />Spoiler<br /><br />What is even worse, is the way he chose to prepare us for a sequel. I
have to admit, it was one of the worst endings I've ever seen and it
didn't even nearly equal the cliff hanger of the first film. All that I
can hope is that Anderson will somehow miraculously step down from this
project, or at least leave the script to someone else. If I were to
compare Apocalypse with the original title, I'd be content to say it's
a teeny, tiny bit better. RE loses because of the little details which
make the movie rather annoying at a second viewing. Actually, it loses
because it's very sloppy.<br /><br />End of Spoiler<br /><br />Then there is also this Alexander Witt. He does a decent job for a
first timer, but he just doesn't succeed in blowing you away. His
attitude towards the audience doesn't involve the viewer enough, and
even though this is where that screen writing issue pops up, I still
believe Witt could've done more about it. I also think I have to agree
with some other people: there's little to no visual eye candy,
something Anderson is pretty good at.<br /><br />I feel I have the obligation to mention that I am a big fan of the
games (which kind of means I'm totally against this &quot;Resident Evil&quot;
that has reached the cinema screens). I've even read Romero's script
(which isn't that great, but I suppose it would've summoned in one film
that which Anderson spreads over this possible trilogy - or whatever it
will end up being), expecting RE:Apocalypse to be just more than its
predecessor was. I suppose I should be satisfied, but I'm only half
satisfied, because it could've been so much more! But, hey, couldn't
life have always been so much more?
