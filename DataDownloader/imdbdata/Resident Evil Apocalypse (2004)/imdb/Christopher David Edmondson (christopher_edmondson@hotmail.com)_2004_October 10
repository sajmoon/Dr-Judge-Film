Milla kicks zombie butt again, and does it harder. REA is bigger badder
and more fun then RE, OK the script was pretty dire, and the quality of
the acting the same, the zombies still look the same as in RE for
scariness but Milla's Alice is now a gun toting action woman with an
attitude who you don't mess with-especially if your a zombie.<br /><br />Whether they'll be a third episode of the franchise is anyone's guess,
but if they do do it, then it would be nice to have Sienna Guillory's
character back as a counter to Milla's Alice. Fast paced lively and
doesn't challenge your mind. 8 out of ten.<br /><br />Just on a nitpicking point how many of you saw the same zombies being
repeatedly killed in different shots as they slowly plodded towards the
STAR police line.
