I haven't see the first RESIDENT EVIL, but I was told that APOCALYPSE
was better than the first. If that's true, than the first one must be
the worst movie ever made.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE is a barely watchable piece of crap. There
isn't a single second in the movie when something isn't happening on
the screen, and yet it's mind-numbingly boring from beginning to end.
Every &quot;scare&quot; is preceded by a few seconds of silence, therefore, no
shocks or jolts are created because the audience is given a warning
before every one.<br /><br />The special effects pretty much suck. The music sucks, the acting
sucks, the screenplay sucks, the editing sucks, the cinematography
sucks, the directing sucks.<br /><br />The movie sucks. There isn't one shred of originality or imagination at
work here. This is a movie that only the most brain dead moron could
possibly find entertaining.<br /><br />And, yes, I mean that.
