I finished all Resident Evil games, on all consoles... and i saw all
resident evil films... i must say that the 1st seemed a low budget
film, just mainly filmed in one facility... the hive. On the contrary,
Apocalypse was amazing, many undead monsters, the insertion of the
nemesis, and more lickers. I am a huge fan of resident evil games and
films... and i must say, Sienna Guillory was just amazing, she played
her part very well... i suggest that the producers will involve Chris
Redfield and his sister (Claire Redfield) in the next one, i think it
would be gr8... thank u<br /><br />Kurt
