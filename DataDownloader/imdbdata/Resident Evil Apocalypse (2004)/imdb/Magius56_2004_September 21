Just see the movie. Preferably twice, due to the fact subtle things
occurring throughout the film that tie it nicely together that are not
always noticed. The story was excellent, which managed to tie in nicely
with the video game. Several scenes could almost cut away to various
clips in the Resident Evil saga. Which to the more experienced watcher,
allows them to almost feel all the various characters and games
occurring simutaniously within the film. Yet the plot by itself was
fascinating and well written, without many of the plot holes you see in
28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead. Animals can't grow crops, but they
don't seem to die of starvation either. Out of all the zombie movies
done these past few years, this is the best next to the original
Resident Evil movie. I hope the negative attention this movie has seen
is due to the timing of its release, because I would sure hate to see
the end of its line premature. Especially if all it leads to is more
poorly made movies from England with bad lighting. Keep the dream alive
and see Resident Evil: Apocalypse. If need be, have someone who plays
the video game explain the finer aspects of the plot.<br /><br />And to all you neh-sayers out there, I have two words for you: Church
Scene!<br /><br />10/10
