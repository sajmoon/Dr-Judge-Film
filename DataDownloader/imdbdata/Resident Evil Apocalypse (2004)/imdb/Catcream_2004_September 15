Resident Evil: Apocalypse is no A Beautiful Mind. It's a fast-paced,
action-filled rollarcoaster ride of a film that doesn't go too deep.
And it works.<br /><br />Anyone who walks into the cinema expecting a film faithful to the
Resident Evil games is going to be disappointed, but if you can turn
your brain off for a couple of hours, you'll probably enjoy Apocalypse.<br /><br />Sienna Guillory does a good job as Jill Valentine, but it's, of course,
Milla Jovovich who steals the entire film, as watchable as ever in the
part of Alice.<br /><br />A fun film for those who like some action with their horror.
