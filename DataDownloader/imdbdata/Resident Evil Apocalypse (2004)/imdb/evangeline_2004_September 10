This is so absurd in terms of storyline or sense or continuity that I
am not even gonna bother...I had to induce myself into such an
aggressive suspense of disbelief that I almost believed I had already
left the theatre...<br /><br />There is nothing, absolutely nothing here except for some action for
action's sake- and as such it gets tired really fast. Action is hard to
top off or even climax if the story itself does not support it, and
here a story/plot is the ultimate luxury, while the action starts way
too soon. Spare me the grief and BUILD UP to it! I can be tricked into
watching pointless &quot;sci-fi&quot; action, but this is just insulting...<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is always fun to watch, especially in a very short skirt
and especially that violent, but I was seriously fidgeting after 20min
and that big turd of the &quot;NEmesis&quot; monster was just a waste of good
makeup.<br /><br />what a bummer- I kinda dug the first one, I had big hopes for the
possibilities...
