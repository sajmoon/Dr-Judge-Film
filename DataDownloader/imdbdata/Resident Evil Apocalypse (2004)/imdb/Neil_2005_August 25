Despite the stilted dialog and hard-to-connect with characters, I liked
the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot; for what it was, a stylish conversion of a
video game with undead mutant dogs. Just can't get enough of those. The
sequel is just a snore. Jump cuts and WAY too much slow motion get in
the way of the action sequences; characters who (once again) you don't
care if they live or die; and long stretches where there is no tension
or excitement, despite the intent of the director. Certainly not
bargain basement awful like &quot;House of the Dead&quot; but not even a decent
rental for a Tuesday night at home. Better to rent a George A. Romero
flick if you want zombies, &quot;Underworld&quot; if you want a slick leather
clad heroine, and any action flick by james Cameron if you want run and
gun shooting.
