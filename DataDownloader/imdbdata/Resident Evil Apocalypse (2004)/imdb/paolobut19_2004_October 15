With Resident Evil 2 being just about the best game ever, and the first
resident evil being just about average, i thought that maybe, just
maybe, this film might have provided some entertainment. Unfortunately,
all it managed to do was shatter all of my wonderful memories of the
classic playstation experience. So I'll keep this brief as it is just
too painful.<br /><br />The direction of this film can be explained in no other way than just
plain irritating. Aimed at people with an attention span of roughly
less than a second, the film never manages to stick with one shot long
enough for you to actually take in anything, and the fight scenes are
so jerkily shot that you have to simply take an educated guess that its
the zombies who are getting beaten up. Awful dialogue is combined
cleverly with worse acting to achieve a spectacularly terrible
spectacle. To cap things off, Jill Valentine (an absolute legend from
the games) is pathetically underwritten almost to the point of
obscurity. Seeing her in that famous little blue top partially
compensated though.<br /><br />Maybe not up (or down) to the horrific computer game-to-movie standards
set by Mortal Kombat, but Resident Evil:Apocalypse still managed to
annoy, bore and upset me in equal measures. 3/10.
