i could say &quot;pointless bull&quot; but i wont...because the first
one...even-though it was a comedy was viewable...i especially hate the
cemetery scene...i don't get why the dead people awake...?? the virus
doesn't spread through air...or doe it?? everyone who is alive and is
just walking around shooting zombies..don't seem to be getting
infected..they breathe the air...and live..but how do dead wake
up...the virus doesn't spread through air...? did zombies go
underground and bite those dead dudes?..in fact their blood isn't
flowing anymore...so how should the virus spread?? and what about that
big ugly mother &quot;f&quot;-r....?? that ruins most of the film...and Milla
Jovovich and that other female cop...what.? are they going to a sex
festival?? do we actually need miniskirts to fight zombies...??!! &quot;f&quot;
off
