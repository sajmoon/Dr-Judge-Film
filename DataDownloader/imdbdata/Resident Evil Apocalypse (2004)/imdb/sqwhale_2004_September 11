Ruined a good franchise. Horrible, horrible acting. First like 20 min.
of the movie was good when it actually was slightly scary and there was
some substance with the zombie outbreak. The rest of the movie was
almost unwatchable. On another note, I don't see how African Americans
don't get offended by being portrayed by clich&eacute;'s like Mike Epps who
was horribly unfunny and just tried to make the movie ghetto. Again,
this movie could have been great because the first one was really good
but they ruined everything. The whole movie felt rushed and put
together real sloppy(camera, plot, character development, etc.). You
also get to hear a lot of horrible fake accents and again the acting is
so, so bad. DON&quot;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
