I have never been a huge fan of the games. I have tried playing many of
them but the controls and camera angles always turned me away. Isaw the
first movie and I enjoyed it, but didn't think that it was all that
great. I got asked at the last minute to see the second one and I said
&quot;Why not&quot;. <br /><br />Let me tell you that I was glad I went. The movie has been given bad
reviews from critics, but they only like movies that no one has ever
heard of.(Not all of them) Apocalypse is one of the most fun movies I
have seen in a while. After not being that impressed by Spidy 2 I
thought the year was pretty much over for good movies. Now I am not
saying that Resident Evil 2 is an awesome movie but it had everything
that would want in a horror/action movie. The movie made me jump once
or twice, it was funny as hell, the action was awesome, and it had some
hot chicks in it. Sienna Guillory was really good and I think see is
really attractive with that color hair. I thought the cast did a great
job and the story was good enough for that type of movie. It made me
want go and buy the games just so I can play them. I can get used to
the cameras and controls. Anyway, definitely go check this movie out.
You will not regret it.
