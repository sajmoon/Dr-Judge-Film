I was so disappointed by the first RE movie when it came out. The first
RE movie was a good film, but as die-hard RE fan, it&#39;s just
disappointing to see they dropped the feeling from the game series and
made it to an average zombie film.<br /><br />They definitely changed the attitude after hearing feedback from the
first one and made a great integration of innovation and ideas from the
game into RE:A.<br /><br />And not only that, they&#39;ve also found the trend of how RE story goes in
the games (like the super-human power Wesker got in RE:codeX game) and
made it part of the main storyline of the movie.
