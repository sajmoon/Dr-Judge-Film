I recently saw the theatrical trailer for the movie Resident Evil:
Extinction and it occurred to me that I never saw either Resident Evil
movies, even though I&#39;ve been wanting to see them. So I rented the
movies yesterday and watched them last night and I have to say that I
was a little surprised about the rating on IMDb, I really loved
Apocalypse, I think I liked it better than the first Resident Evil.
Milla Jovovich is still so awesome and I think she&#39;s improved since the
first movie. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse we have more action and in my
opinion a very awesome story, one that is even up there I would say
with George Romero&#39;s zombie stories.<br /><br />We start where we have left off where Alice has been left in the lab
with her friend, Matt. But she escapes and finds a world that is not
the same, where the virus has broken out into the world and zombies are
now walking above ground. People are doing their best to survive and
there are now new people called STARS where they are being eliminated
by a huge new monster who might be familiar to Alice. But she is with
survivors: Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera, Captain Nicholai and they
find a little girl, Angie Ashford who&#39;s dad Dr. Ashford is the man who
created the virus and is being hunted down.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse was very awesome to watch and it&#39;s a buy for
me at least. I&#39;m really looking forward to Extinction now, I can&#39;t wait
to see how they continue the story. See, the only bummer about me
watching this now is because now I have to wait for the sequels as
well. But at least I get the experience of the theater. But anyways, I
would recommend this movie for anyone, it&#39;s an awesome movie to watch
and has terrific action.<br /><br />8/10
