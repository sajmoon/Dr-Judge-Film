You know that moment in every action or horror movie when the baddie is
just about to kill, maim, bite, or otherwise put the hurt on a
sympathetic character, when another, unseen sympathetic character
shoots/stabs/whatevers the baddie in JUST the nick of time? &quot;Resident
Evil: Apocalypse&quot; is an entire film based around just repeating that
moment again and again and again. Each time, the director (who's
somehow less famous and reputable than Paul W.S. Anderson, if that's
conceivable) honestly seems to expect us to react to it, which borders
on insulting. While it's not the worst movie of the year (&quot;Day After
Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;AvP&quot; have it beat, while &quot;Chronicles of Riddick&quot; has it
just about even), it's easily the most repetitive, predictable and
stale--pretty much every shot or sequence you see is blatantly ripped
off from some other movie.<br /><br />If there is a redeeming quality to this movie, it's the nice assortment
of surprisingly subtle visual references to the classic &quot;Resident Evil
2&quot; video game, on which it is loosely based. Unfortunately, the movie
seems to have abandoned that great game's penchant for eerie
atmospheric thrills in favor of constant, ridiculous action. Making an
action movie out of &quot;Resident Evil 2,&quot; a game firmly routed in the
cinematic traditions of horror, is akin to making a horror movie out of
&quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;--it's just the wrong idea.<br /><br />Though they may draw similar audiences, horror and action actually
aren't all that compatible, and nothing drives that point home like
sitting through this movie. It sacrifices scares for explosions,
atmosphere for flashy edits, and human fear for superhuman kung fu
heroics. The constant use of the aforementioned just-in-time device is
an attempt to artificially inject some real fear and tension, but it
fails because of its predictability.<br /><br />I'd compare this to the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film if I could remember
anything about it besides Milla's brief nudity. This film, thankfully,
seems destined to fade from memory just as quickly--leaving only
fleeting glimpse of Milla's goodies behind.
