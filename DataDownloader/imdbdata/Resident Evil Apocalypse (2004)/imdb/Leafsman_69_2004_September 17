I saw this movie just the other week. this film unlike the first had a
high entertainment value. this edition of the resident evil series is
filmed in the streets as opposed to the underground Hive in the 1st
installment. Some people have made mention of the lack of character
development in the movie, however i do not believe that the goal of
this film was to have you engrossed in character development. Milla
suits her role just fine, especially in her b-day suit. Apocalypse is a
very dark movie with more blue lights then sunlight. the action is
non-stop, and the black guy provides comic relief. more appealing
characters are in the movie and the setting of downtown Toronto leads
for endless possibilities to occur.<br /><br />Other then the lack of character development, the other weakness is the
camera movement during the fight scenes, sometimes you can't see what
the hell is going on. ironically the zombies are not the most evil
enemy in the movie, neither is Nemisis, but it is the real humans who
run the Umbrella co. these guys are truly hateable who u would love to
see die a terrible death. throughout the movie, there is a sense all
all impending doom if the characters don't escape. this puts you on the
edge of your seat even more. the movie is filled with spectacular
stunts and ends with a Bang! hang on to your seats, this will probably
be the best big screen/popcorn movie of the year. 100% pure fun.
