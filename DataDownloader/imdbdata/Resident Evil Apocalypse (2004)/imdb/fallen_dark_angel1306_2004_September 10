My Name is Alice, and I remember everything...<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is stunning once again as Alice in Resident Evil:
Apocalypse.<br /><br />RE2 had more action packing and azz kicking scenes than the first, even
if the plot was a little thin. <br /><br />Co-starring Oded Fehr, Resident Evil: Apocalypse will keep you wanting
more.<br /><br />(Really, as in more story line) <br /><br />It was good, but could have been better. It's worth seeing for the
action. 6.5 out of 10.
