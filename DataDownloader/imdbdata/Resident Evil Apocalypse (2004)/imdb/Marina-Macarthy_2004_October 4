This movie was like spot the connection to the game there are so many
broad references you find yourself looking for them throughout the
entire movie. I was surprised to see so much good acting and the plot
was fine but i was truly disappointed by the way they turned Nemesis in
to a pussy cat near the end. Hes a mean blood thirsty machine in the
game with one thing on his mind in the movie hes a killer with a heart
?????<br /><br />Good movie I'd waited two years to see it and wasn't that disappointed.
