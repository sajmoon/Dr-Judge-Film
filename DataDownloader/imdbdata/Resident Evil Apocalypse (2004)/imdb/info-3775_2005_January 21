As one of the few fans of the original, I was disappointed to see the
announcement of part 2 of Resident Evil. With the open ending of part
1, it was to be expected, but if you've seen the ending of part 1, you
can almost guess part 2 is going to be bad. In part 2, Raccoon City
suffered from a massive T-Virus infection and zombies are everywhere.
The city is being quarantined, and the armed forces inside are being
overwhelmed. There's one way out of the city: A young girl is trapped
somewhere inside, and her father wants her out. As a member of
Umbrella, he will make sure that whoever rescues his daughter gets an
escort out of the city.<br /><br />Milla got beefed up with more moves this movie, which is very
disappointing. I don't like it when there's some godlike character
running through a world killing zombies with her bare hands.<br /><br />All in all, this movie lacks mystery. It's just pure action. Zombies
get gunned down every second, and the movie lived up to my
expectations: It's as bad as I thought it would be.
