I cannot even begin to describe disappointed I was upon seeing
Apocalypse. I had been waiting to see it for a very long time and was
quite sure the critiques were just being critiques and that the movie
was awesome! I should have respected the experience.<br /><br />What the hell Alexander Witt?! Where are the zombies, man?! The whole
movie was about the Thing-and-Robocop-hybrid Nemesis (Ah, and how scary
I&#39;d imagined it would be..) and the long-coming death match between him
and Alice. There was no room for zombies! <br /><br />Alice was turned into a superhero, acrobatic cycler, angry Lara Croft.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, this does not give the movie a game-like feeling.
(If you want to see the best example for that, watch Silent Hill) The
director takes Resident Evil by the hand and dishonorably turns it into
an average action flick. <br /><br />How low can you get, adding pointless action scenes to a zombie movie
just to keep the tension up? (&quot;Omg! They&#39;re gonna get bored! Milla,
break through this window with your motorbike! This&#39;ll give us a few
more minutes.&quot; ) <br /><br />And Jill Valentine... Great choice of actress but bad, bad practice
integrating her to the film. She was absolutely suppressed by Alice and
didn&#39;t really serve any purpose to the film. Maybe two alpha females
can&#39;t be a good idea.<br /><br />The writing was bad (lots of &quot;But why?&quot;s and &quot;But how?&quot;s), the ending
was bad (although it was supposed to leave us surprised and excited),
the characters were mostly shallow and it was not, I repeat, NOT nearly
scary enough.<br /><br />Resident Evil is supposed to be scary. That&#39;s like the first and very
simple rule of the RE trademark, unfortunately the director preferred
to ignore it and showed us how unimaginative he can be about scary
movies. If I were a studio, I would never, ever hand him over another
horror project.
