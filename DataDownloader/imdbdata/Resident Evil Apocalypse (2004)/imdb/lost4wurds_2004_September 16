I don't know if I should slam this god awful crapfest of a movie or
blame myself for even going to see it after I saw the &quot;EXTREME&quot;
trailers for it. I'll do the movie for now as I have years to blame
myself for my misjudgment.<br /><br />RE:A just proves the fact that no matter how much money and shine you
add, a piece of crap is a piece of crap. This movie is really aimed at
the extreme sport masses that must all prize glitz and special effects
over substance.<br /><br />Now, before I say more, I have to clear up the fact that I love
horror/zombie flicks. I'm not some film snob that will only patronize
artsy and independent cinema (though I probably should after seeing
this smoking load). I enjoy a good visceral escape like the next
person. In fact, I love the original Predator very much and that really
doesn't have any substance to speak of.<br /><br />That being said, if you want a good action movie experience and are one
of those poor folks who can excuse a terrible flick by saying, &quot;Yeah it
was bad, but the special effects were awesome!&quot;, then by all means, GO!
You'll likely love the film and give blowing reviews on every message
board from here to the end of the internet. However, if you are someone
who looks at the schmuck and wants to slap him in the back of head for
saying something so stupid, then take my advice and skip this one. The
characters are terrible, the plot is horrendous and dashes the logic of
even the first RE, and it's filled with way too many EXTREME moments
for it's own good. From rappelling cops with guns, to heroines who can
smash through glass without getting cut, RE:A just says to heck with
reality and goes on without a second thought. I was laughing during the
whole thing and kept imagining the mulleted masses that this movie was
aimed at. Then, I was shaking my head when I realized that this must be
what America really wants. That made me plan my escape route to our
brother from the north. Canada, here I come!<br /><br />3 out of 10 stars. Save yourself the 8 bucks and check out a quality
flick like the original Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, or even the
Not-Romero-but-far-from-terrible Dawn remake.
