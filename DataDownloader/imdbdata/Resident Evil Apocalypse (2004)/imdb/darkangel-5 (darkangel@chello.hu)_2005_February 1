There are movies which, especially if you shut down your brain cells,
can really rock. Resident Evil, both of them, are definitely two of
those. Although this time around you don't really have to minimize your
brain activity or intellectual in order to have fun watching this
movie, and it's also enjoyable for those also, who have never played
the video game. And it's definitely suggested for those who like to
watch hard and beautiful girls kicking a$$. Resident Evil: Apocalypse
is by far the best video-game-into-movie project I have seen so far.
It's a tough area for movie-makers to write a decent plot and make a
watchable movie of a video game.<br /><br />This story, again, takes place in Raccoon City, which is obviously
Toronto... I had an inner smile while watching the opening scenes
showing the unmistakable Toronto skyline with US flags all around, and
I was wondering that whether A) the USA invaded Canada and renamed the
city (maybe as a retaliation to the continuous humiliation in ice
hockey), B) Americans loved Toronto so much they copied it, or C) the
German director and actors were not able to make a difference between
Canada and the USA anyway. Well, it's not Chicago at least, for Toronto
played Chicago in that overrated cheesy award winning musical hype...
Besides Vancouver, Toronto is probably the most occupied Canadian
figure in US movies. :-)<br /><br />The first part had a cliff-hanger ending, which became the starting
point of the sequel. This one is definitely an upgrade version of the
prequel, I guess the director and co. learned a lot since finishing the
first part of the series. Which is a lot better in the sequel is
definitely the casting. Since it's a zombie movie and resurrection is
possible, I was wishing that Michelle Rodriguez, one of the
least-talented actresses in Hollywood by my opinion, wouldn't come back
to life. (Wonder why she hasn't yet won any Razzies...) And YES, she
won't! It was fun watching her character die ugly in the prequel, and
her character (No.2. hard-a$$ chick) was replaced by Sienna Guillory,
who's a very talented actress, played Helen of Troy and had a
heart-breakingly wonderful performance in Sorted. I wouldn't have
thought she fits in this character this much, but she's really
convincing! She's been a good pick for the role. Mike Epps adds a new
color to the movie and it was great to see Sandrine Holt again in an
action movie, even if her character is a little drawn back this time.
And Milla Jovovich (Alice) delivers the same good quality as in the
prequel, but this time the acting skills of the characters are more
balanced, thus the movie is more enjoyable. The only irritating thing
regarding the actors is the constant German accent by a bunch of
actors. It's especially irritating when it comes to a US government
official... At least you cannot say it's not multicultural enough: US
government officials with a German accent in a (ex-?)Canadian
town...:-)<br /><br />Other bad things I can mention: the zombies are so lame and boring.
They move the same, look the same, and the same extras are used in
different street shots... The other one is the lame and a bit cheesy
final showdown between two main characters (I'm not telling their names
in order to avoid spoiling). <br /><br />To sum it up: it's a great and enjoyable movie, definitely suggested
for those who want 90+odd minutes of action and entertainment.<br /><br />Can't wait for the third one, especially since this one has a
cliffhanger ending too.
