While I felt the first and third movies in this trilogy were entirely
average, this second part of the trilogy is nothing short of excellent.
Here&#39;s why.<br /><br />This movie breaks the mold of survival horror movies. The usual formula
places a group of characters together and kills them off one at a time
over the course of the movie. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse, the story
progression is much more open ended. We follow the stories of several
different groups of characters in different parts of a city sealed off
from the outside world to contain the outbreak of a virus. While many
characters do die, in this case, it is happening to unique groups of
people all making their own way to survive in a city over- run by
zombies. Their story lines eventually converge of course, but the
storyboarding developed to bring about this connection is stellar. As
icing on the cake, all of these characters feel excellently cast and
developed.<br /><br />There are special effects in this movie, but they do not overpower the
realism of human acting. The zombies, and most importantly, the Nemesis
monster, are real actors in elaborate costumes and makeup. <br /><br />The directing and set design are also excellent. This movie feels like
a horror movie whereas the other two simply pass as alright action
movies. The sets are intricately designed, with the very smallest
attention to detail throughout. They are dark, filled with well placed
streams of light and shadow, and dirty looking, in direct opposition to
the clean, slick nature of the first movie. Everything really feels
much closer to what the games envisioned in this outing. The directing
is outstanding, filled with inspired camera angels, and the knowledge
that true horror does not come from throwing scary beasts at us, but
through the unknown about any scenario. The church scene is
particularly inspired, giving us only the smallest glimpse of three
attackers stalking the characters being portrayed. The level of
suspense is masterfully built slowly to a climax around wonderful
camera angels and the mood of the set. It is also no wonder why the
acting in the movie feels so superb as well. It may not be the stuff of
Oscars, but it is outstanding by action/horror standards. A great
director can bring out the best talent from their actors and actresses.
Another classic scene portrays frantic citizens of Racoon city trying
to leave through the one exit in the barrier surrounding the city until
one man at the front of the line succumbs to infection.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse is an A grade movie, and by far the best of
the series. If only all three were this good, and the director of this
movie had been brought back for the third installment. It isn&#39;t a
perfect film, but it is excellent in all the most important places. If
you only buy or see one movie out of this trilogy, see this one. It is
expertly crafted.
