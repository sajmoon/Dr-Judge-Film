This sequel to the excellent 'Resident Evil' more than lived up to my
expectations in every way. As a big fan of the first film and its
director, Paul W.S. Anderson (I realize he is an acquired taste), I was
initially worried when I learned he was handing the reigns over to
newcomer Alexander Witt. I never should have doubted Anderson because
this sequel blew me away. It's been two hours since I saw it and I am
still trying to catch my breath!<br /><br />For a video-game movie, you couldn't ask for more: non-stop action,
visual flair in almost every shot, an attractive cast (in these movies,
nobody cares about acting skills), and an ending that promises more for
the future. Sure, there are glaring plot holes, but who cares? You
don't go see movies like this for an intricately detailed plot and
in-depth character development. You go see movies like this to have a
good time. It won't win an Oscar but nobody expects or wants it to.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest difference between the films is Where that the
first film had a tight and claustrophobic feel, this installment is an
all out, no-holds barred smorgasbord of violence and noise....and it
never makes the slightest attempt to apologize for this fact. I thank
Mr. Witt profusely for that. Furthermore, he does not try to copy the
style of the first film. Instead, he made the decision (a chance-y one)
to unleash a whole new bag of tricks. While that could have been a
disaster for the franchise, it ended up being the smartest thing for
it.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like video-game movies, you can't get any better
than 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. If you don't like video-game movies,
well, I guess you really don't have any business going to see it in the
first place, now do you?
