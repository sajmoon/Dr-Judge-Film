I&#x27;d like to start by saying, I didn&#x27;t like the first Resident Evil, but
I saw potential in the sequel, as we&#x27;d be out of that bunker and into
the real world, so i liked it enough to see the sequel. And although i
would say I did enjoy this one more, I&#x27;d still say it was bad.<br /><br />&#x22;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x22; is bad on so many levels, but I&#x27;d like to
start on the good points and end on a negative (I&#x27;m in one of those
moods).<br /><br />The best part is that it keeps you entertained, in the first half I was
rolling my eyes a bit, thinking that it was terrible, but the second
half did wake me up a little bit, there&#x27;s plenty of action and some
edge-of-your-seat moments, however this can be undermined by how daft
the story is.<br /><br />That&#x27;s the only good part really, that it was entertaining and
enjoyable, arguably the most important factor for a film as well,
however I did watch &#x22;Martyrs&#x22; for the fourth time the other night and
is quite a contrast to this. Masterpiece to meh.<br /><br />Now for the bad points :(. There&#x27;s a lot of them, so get ya cataracts
ready! Firstly, the story was a mish mash like in the first one. This
whole business of some annoying engilshman finding his daughter was
clich&#xE9;, his accent got on my nerves, as did his daughter&#x27;s and I&#x27;m
English myself! There is little to no character development, no one is
likable. When someone dies you don&#x27;t feel anything, in fact you&#x27;re
egging them on to croak! This is where films such as &#x22;Dawn of the Dead&#x22;
and &#x22;28 Days Later&#x22; succeed as zombie films. They aren&#x27;t big budget,
high concept films and so they don&#x27;t just blow the budget on blowing
things up for the sake of it. They concentrate on the characters,
people who you care about, making them emotionally driven films.
&#x22;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x22; doesn&#x27;t build on characters. That&#x27;s a
negative in my book.<br /><br />The directing and editing was appalling as well! I couldn&#x27;t believe
what I was seeing, whenever anyone shoots a zombie the cameras all over
the place flicking back and forth so that you completely miss what was
on screen! It really is awful on the editing side.<br /><br />The acting was bad, the girls just seemed to be there in the male gaze
and times have moved on! I&#x27;m a male myself, but I just think it&#x27;s plain
sexist to make an attractive female waltz around wearing little to
leave to the imagination! We should get past Mulvey&#x27;s male gaze! In the
end Alice ends up fighting bad guys with a towel wrapped around her!
Why not go the full hog and have her shooting people naked! Well, it
wouldn&#x27;t be withing Barthes striptease theory then would it? I know I
sound like an old man when I say this (I&#x27;m actually 16 :S) but I didn&#x27;t
like the use of CGI, the bit in the church was terrible! And a lot of
the time it just thought it was too cool by trying too hard. Let&#x27;s have
a man jump out of a helicopter shooting zombies with cool music in slow
motion. It&#x27;s trying too hard and it just isn&#x27;t &#x22;cool&#x22;. Don&#x27;t get me
wrong, sometimes it was quite &#x22;cool&#x22; but most of the time they tried
too hard.<br /><br />In the end &#x22;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x22; plays out more as an action
movie rather than a horror film. Leave the zombies to my Romero. There
was plenty of shooting, but no blood. I like to see my zombie films
gory and scary. Believe or not however, I did actually enjoy some
parts. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be the only person who rolled my eyes at some
ridiculous B-movie machine gun wielding monster in a leather jacket.
Was I?
