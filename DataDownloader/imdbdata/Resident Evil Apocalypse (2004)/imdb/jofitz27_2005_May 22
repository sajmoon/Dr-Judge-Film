Where 'Apocalypse' fails, it delivers. I heard someone suggest a
'PG-13' would be favourable as a marketing suggestion, but thank god,
that was shoved aside. This is uncut, and because of that, this
delivers. Though this may be pretty terrible by and large, it is huge
fun to watch. The action sequences deliver incredibly.<br /><br />With no real motive but to get the zombies and humans fighting, the
action starts unrealistically but manages to hold the attention. On
occasion, this manages to be cool, though the flaws are so unbelievably
obvious it seems credit to the director to even pretend they're not
there. To much detail is unnecessary, and will probably prove notice to
how bad this is.<br /><br />And though the script is simply silly Mike Epps is great to add comedy
to the supposedly 'scary' backup. Some of the characters decisions are
so utterly ridiculously unexplained it turns into unintentional comedy.
The characters have no motives: they're doing the script, nothing more.
Oh well.<br /><br />It still manages to be pretty stylish though, but never scary. It is,
despite it's constant violence, hardly gory. But it is violent.<br /><br />Forgotten, overdone, melodramatic, terribly scripted... yet curiously
enticing.<br /><br />**/ out of **** (2 and a half out of 4)
