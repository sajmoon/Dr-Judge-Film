STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A
Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br /><br />Expanding on the plot of the original movie,a major virus has broken
out over Raccoon City.The Umbrella Corporation is responsible and is
refusing to provide adequate care.As flesh-eating zombies terrorise the
streets,Alice (Milla Jovovich) leads the resistance who fight back and
attempt to make The Umbrella Corporation accountable for their actions.<br /><br />Making video games in to movies is a nefarious business,as anyone who's
seen the publicity surrounding any movie that's been adapted from a
video game (even if that movie in all honesty is quite enjoyable,i.e.
Street Fighter) will tell you.And making a sequel is an even riskier
endeavor,as anyone who's seen the publicity surrounding any sequel to a
video game movie (i.e. Mortal Kombat:Annihilation) will tell you.Given
I didn't find the original movie from director Paul W.S. Anderson (who
penned the script for this one and who recently helmed the Alien Vs
Predator movie) that much of a mind-blowing experience and that I was
never in to the Play Station video games the original film was based on
in the first place,I wasn't exactly rushing out to give this sequel a
go.And had I known what a cr*ppy spectacle this new film from director
Alexander Witt (aptly named since he's made such a Witt-less film!) was
going to be,I would have evaporated what interest I had altogether.<br /><br />If the lame,unengaging story and woefully inane dialogue don't put you
off,I should warn any viewers that are especially sensitive to
loud,sudden noises that they're happening here,to and nether in this
film (I was surprised the Fat Slags didn't show up,to be honest!!!) to
the point where you're always on edge waiting for the next shuddering
scene to come up.Even the special effects and creature designs look
tacky and unimpressive,but they ultimately sum up the tone of the whole
film.It's a droning and unmerry experience,where no one seems to be
having a good time and nobody seems to be nice to each other.It
ultimately shows up what a joyless and ugly spectacle this misguided
loser is.Aptly,since everyone in the film seems to be trying to avoid a
plague,that is exactly what you should avoid it like.*
