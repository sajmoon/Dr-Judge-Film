This movie kicks the first one by a long shot. The action in here was
explosive and sweet. I would recommend anyone to see this movie (If you
have seen the first). The plot was excellent, the characters were
sweet, Jill Valentine was sexy as hell, The nemesis creature was
exactly like the game, the non-stop action was an awesome ride. I give
this movie 10/10 for everything. Screw what the other people say,
listen to me. If you want real horror action see this movie, or even
the first if it pleases you. But, due not miss out This is great movie.<br /><br />DJ Fire@Work
