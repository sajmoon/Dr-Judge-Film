I was disappointed in the female cop actress. She wasn't very good at
all. Wish they would have picked someone with more talent, of course
understanding that the co-star cannot be as great as the star (Milla
ROCKS!!!) Overall an excellent action film and definitely a buyer! I do
hope they make a 3rd one! THEY JUST HAVE TO!! Milla Jovovich is one the
best actresses I have seen in ages! I have always been a sucker for a
film where women handle themselves just as good if not better than a
man can or does. It makes me want to be an actress myself! We have come
a long way in that aspect of life. She has inspired many women,
including me and I hope to one day meet her, but knowing that probably
won't ever happen, I can still wish for it. Thanks and keep up the
great work! :) Jacq'
