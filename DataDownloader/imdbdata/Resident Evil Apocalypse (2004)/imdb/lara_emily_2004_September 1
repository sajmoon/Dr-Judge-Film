Saw an advanced screening tonight of the movie. Without going into too
much detail. I thought it was fantastic and far superior to the first
one. First of all we finally got a character from the games in the
wonderful and sexy Jill Valentine (she was amazing, my favorite
character in the movie by far with a great introduction. You'll just
have to see it for yourself though ^_-). The film felt much more for
the most part like an RE game then the first one did, the action was
great, the story was fine. Overall a solid *** to **** action/horror
film (that is to say I compared it with other films in that genre
instead of movies in general). I'd highly recommend it to anyone who
liked the first one, but even if you haven't seen it you can still
enjoy this one as well.
