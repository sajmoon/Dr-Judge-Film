This movie has everything a well done action movie should have: an
intriguing story line, amazing special effects, and scantily clad
beautiful women with large weapons!! Great fun for everyone, except the
zombies.<br /><br />The director does a wonderful job of making the movie look exactly like
the video game it is based on. I particularly enjoyed use of a large
corporation trying to control the world as the villain. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong: this movie will never win an Oscar. But if you are
looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this
is it!
