2004_September 10 

As a big fan of the first one (and its successor, 28 Days Later) I
couldn't wait to see RE:A on opening night. <br /><br />I wasn't disappointed, but that's because I didn't expect the subtle
greatness of the first one. <br /><br />RE:A is really more of an action movie that happens to have zombies
than a zombie movie with some action. There's about the same amount of
character development (maybe less except for, as with the first one,
Alice) but the characters are still fun and do their jobs.<br /><br />Sienna Guillory was great as the video game character Jill, it's too
bad she didn't get more screen time.<br /><br />The real star of the movie should have been the action and fighting
scenes, but Alexander Witt seems to suffer from the &quot;let's make action
scenes hard to follow and choppy so you really FEEL in the movie&quot;
syndrome. Peter Jackson had it, which was my only complaint with the
LotR trilogy. But those movies were beautiful anyway, and RE:A is FUN
anyway, and isn't that why we go to a theater?<br /><br />I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. Higher if you love the first one or the
video games.
