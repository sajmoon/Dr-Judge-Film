I went and saw this movie Yesterday and i was really good..but not as
good as the first.. i mean i weill still get it when it comes out on
DVD but i don't think Paul Anderson will be making another movie about
it because i personally think this one wont make as much as the first..
some parts of the movie were pretty dumb and they killed of a majority
of the people in the movie with stupid ways.. but i give this movie an
8 out of 10 on my list.. I mean you have to say it was pretty cool how
Umbrella covered up the Incident in Raccoon City... and have any of you
noticed at the end of the movie when they go for the Umbrella Satellite
that the city thay were in was in the Midwest..ha thats pretty funny
because from were they were showing it it looked to me that it was in
Missouri or some where near that.
