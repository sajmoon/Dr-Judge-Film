Making it to the end without turning it off: 1 point <br /><br />Meager action, maybe 3 good but short scenes: 1 point<br /><br />Story: 0 points (greedy corporate jerk makes a virus / superhuman)<br /><br />Character development: 0 points<br /><br />Gore: 0 points (not enough)<br /><br />Suspense: 0 points (lame attempts)<br /><br />Special effects: 0 points <br /><br />This movie *might* be worth a buck at the dollar theater but I wont
watch it again even on cable. <br /><br />If you liked the game or enjoy bad movies, go for it.<br /><br />Also, the early scenes with black men and white women were just for the
posters and previews. Viewers lured by this will be disappointed.
