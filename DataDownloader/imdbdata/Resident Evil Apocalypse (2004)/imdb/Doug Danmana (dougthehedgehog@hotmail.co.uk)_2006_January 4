OK, I'm not going to explain the story add any spoilers or whatever.<br /><br />Resident Evil is the massive game Franchise from &quot;Capcom&quot; It is one of
my personal favourites, i was so excited hearing about the first
Resident Evil movie.<br /><br />When i saw it i felt that the whole Resident Evil Franchise got screwed
over. I know Game to movie tie in suck, i mean look at Super Mario Bros
or Tomb Raider, those films suck. Of course the first Resident Evil
movie had to follow this bi-law It's like the unwritten rule of Game to
Movie But Resident Evil:Apocalypse really did appeal. I thought it was
awesome and Did Resident Evil justice My favourite Characters from
Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, had made it onto the big screen playing
alongside the ever so hot Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />The story is actually getting interesting but the shame is that most of
the main characters from the games arn't in it. Albert Wesker is most
important but he is still absent. Hopefully Afterlife will bring more
of the characters from the Game world into the Movie.<br /><br />I do think it deserves a 10 because of the awesome stunts and action,
also the costume design on the Nemesis was right on the money.
Hopefully afterlife will prove even better than Apocalypse.
