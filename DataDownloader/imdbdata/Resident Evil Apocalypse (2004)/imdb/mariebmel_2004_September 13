Let me just start by saying that I am a horror/sci-fi movie buff. I
even love the 'B' horror movies and enjoy them in all their cheesiness.
This, however, really kind of ticked me off. I was really looking
forward to seeing this. I'm not going to bother describing it because
so many other people have. While it had it's good moments, overall I
really thought it was terrible. It wasn't even funny terrible, just
terrible. <br /><br />1. Parts of the movie looked cheap. 2. The whole thing was filled with
explosions,it was mind numbing. 3. Why the heck was Jill Valentine
wearing that ridiculous outfit? No explanation was ever given. 4. The
guy playing the computer programmer was unbelievably irritating. I have
no idea why he was cast in this role. 5. There was so little character
development that I really could have cared less if they were infected.<br /><br />The only kind of cool thing was Nemesis. He looked ridiculous but at
least I got a good laugh out of it
