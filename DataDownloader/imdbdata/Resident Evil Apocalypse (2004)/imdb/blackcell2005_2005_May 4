Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a mixed blessing. It is better in some
ways to the first, but worse in others. Some of the dialogue was bad,
so was the bad guys 'German' accent, it was so bad, but he did seem
like a bad guy, unlike some films. Milla Jovovich is back thanks god
with a whole new cast, and they deliver. The Nemesis is the reason I
watched this film, he is so much like his game counterpart, except he
doesn't use the hand-tentacle thing. Some parts are bad, like the
Lickor's skin, but I'm glad they are back. The graveyard part was just
stupid. It has humour in it, JD seems to be in there just to be funny.
The zombies have multiplied, and Alice, Jill and the crew are always
trying to avoid them, but thanks to the addition of Angie, the film
seems to make the T-Virus a thing to fear, its a great film, watch it
for a good night of moderate horror, in fact, watch Resident Evil 1 and
2, make your judgement, and let everyone know it.
