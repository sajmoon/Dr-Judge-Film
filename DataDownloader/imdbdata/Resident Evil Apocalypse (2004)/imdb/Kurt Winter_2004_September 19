This movie follows a very straight line. There are a series of setups,
quick character development, and then, bang bang bang. The film follows
a true video game formula, with ever increasing difficulty facing the
heroes .<br /><br />The film has great atmosphere, great sound and great special effects,
but unfortunately, it does not make up for the lack of plot devices.<br /><br />Unlike movies derived from comic books or heavily influenced by them,
this film has absolutely no plot devices, it is by the numbers. Kill a
bad creature, then kill a hundred of them, and then face a worse
creature. Move to next board, where you face a hundred of the worse
creatures, and then get introduced to another character, who meets the
next level in depravity.<br /><br />This film lacks all intelligence - you can take a thirty minute
bathroom break and not miss anything, except for violence and gore.
Very similar to watching a hardcore gamer play through a video game. <br /><br />If you think this review is too cynical, whatever. Watch &quot;Aliens&quot; to
see how a film can be a horror/action flick, and still have meaningful
character development, have subplots and other interesting twists. <br /><br />Do you want to see a REAL horror flick? Check out &quot;Darkness&quot;, 2002.
Want to see an ENTERTAINING zombie flick? Check out &quot;Sean of the Dead&quot;,
2003. Want to see an INTELLIGENT action flick, featuring Milla
Jovivich? Go no further than the &quot;Fifth Element&quot;, 1998.
