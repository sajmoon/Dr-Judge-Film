The film is entertaining and more then I expected from a zombie / video
game film. I've seen both movies and played the game a little. I
haven't been disappointed by either of the movies. If you went in
expecting to see Lawrence of Arabia that was your mistake. This film
has all the makings of a great B horror and action flick. If your
looking for action, some suspense and ton of zombies you won't be
disappointed. Hopefully, they will continue with the series making it a
trilogy. The ending was left pretty much wide open to continue on. The
only thing I really missed was the excellent theme music from the first
movie. Hopefully, they can come up with something good in the 3rd
installment.<br /><br />- JP
