I liked this movie a lot. Milla did a awesome job...kicked butt! I think
it was better then the first movie. Tons more zombie action, and
Nemesis!!! I'm a HUGE fan of the games, and Nemesis, they did and
freaking great job on him, I love it when he yelled &quot;S.T.A.R.S!!&quot;
Things jumping out left and right. lol I only have two questions. 1)
What happened to Clair? I was sure she was suppose to be in this movie,
the even said so on the site, right? And 2) Where the hell is Wesker
already?? That guy rocks, the quintasential bad guy, the brain behind
the whole thing. You'd at least think he would be mentioned! Oh well,
still a great movie. This is a must see......SO GO SEE IT! lol
