I thought Resident Evil: Apocalypse successes up to Resident Evil
perfectly. It certainly wasn&#39;t better, but it&#39;s not a bad movie. I
enjoyed watching Alice kick some more asses with awesome non-stop
action, and they did a really great job on the script structure, though
of course the story line in the first was WAY better. That&#39;s why I
didn&#39;t COMPLETELY compare it to the first, because if you do that
you&#39;re sure to find this as a bad movie, because the first can&#39;t be
beat, but then I decided to stop criticizing Resident Evil: Apocalypse
so much and I focused on the positive things and when I was through I
had myself one wonderful film. I totally recommend you see if you loved
the first.
