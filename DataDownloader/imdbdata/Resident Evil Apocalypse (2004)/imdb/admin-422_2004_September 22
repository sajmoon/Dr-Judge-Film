The movie was excellent. I hear a lot of newbies saying that the movies
wee stupid and that they were nothing like the game. I disagree in
full. In fact, I bet the ones who complained are the ones who always
talk through the movie and toss popcorn like immature children.<br /><br />I have every Resident Evil book, every Resident Evil game, every
Resident Evil action figure. I know RE inside and out. How can people
say the first movie was irrelevant, when the books and games never went
that far back, yet?<br /><br />CAPCOM has made it clear that they wanted to focus on what the books
and games did not show, giving us a more broad view of what happened
instead of making us relive games we already had beaten 5 times each.<br /><br />Somebody said something about &quot;What is up with he gargoyles coming to
life?&quot; Well, friend, that was a &quot;Licker&quot; from RE2 and RE3. It was
merely sitting next to gargoyles.<br /><br />Jill on th side? Why do people complain of this? There are many points
of view in RE. Jill was not the only person to experience it. We know
her entire story, why the heck do we want to see the same stuff, this
time in a movie? This movie showed the behind the scenes, so to speak.
It showed what the games could not fill in; without getting to be too
long of a game.<br /><br />To those who dog the movie, you are ignorant of the games and the
storyline. The story and time lines were perfect in both movies. Think
I am full of it? Then read the books and play the games in sequence
according to time line of the story.....you will then see that the
movies were objective, efficient, and perfectly tailored.<br /><br />One more thing: Umbrella was trying to create the perfect biological
weapon. They did it when they altered Alice, and failed with Nemesis.
He is strong, but can not blend in with a crowd if need be.
