This is a sequel to the 100 million dollar film Resident Evil (2002).
This time Poul Anderson is not directing due to working on the film
AVP. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is instead directed by Alexander Witt.
It is the first film that Witt has directed and he did a good job. The
first film wasn't that good. It had very many problems with it and
didn't stick to the games or have any characters from the games at all.
Well Resident EVil: Apocalopse makes up for that with bringing in the
character Jill Valentine. The overall film has allot more action and
along of great memorable scenes. It is a great zombie film. Nemises the
unstable monster from the third video game, makes his movie debut and
is better than ever. Though he has been called a &quot;gothic power ranger
villain&quot; he stays true to the games design. Of course Milla Jovich
reprises her role as Alice, but this time she is much more powerful.
The film itself is 100 times better than the original. If a third keeps
up with this trend it would be Oscar worthy. 4/10 is my final rating
for Resident Evil: Apocalypse and just in case you're wondering my
score for Resident Evil (2002) was 3/10. So enjoy this brainless action
zombie film.
