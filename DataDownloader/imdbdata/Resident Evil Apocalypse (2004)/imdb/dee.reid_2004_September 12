2004_September 12 

I'll be fair in stating that &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; is the perfect
film to close out the turbulent summer of 2004. So far we've had &quot;The
Passion of the Christ,&quot; &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11,&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; - all of
which have had a significant impact at the box office this summer.<br /><br />&quot;Apocalypse&quot; will be easy fodder for the critics, as they will balk
early and be on alert for the slightest flaw. They'll pick apart the
MTV-style editing, bad pacing, and seeming lack of an actual plot.
Fanatics will pick apart the film for not staying true to the &quot;Resident
Evil&quot; video games. For the record, I never played the video games that
&quot;Resident Evil&quot; is based on, so I can't comment on accuracy.<br /><br />This film was really a birthday present for myself. I used one of two
(count 'em - TWO!) free tickets that came with my purchase of the DVD
for the first film &quot;Resident Evil (Deluxe Edition).&quot; It doesn't
disappoint in the action category or special effects, as there is
plenty of both.<br /><br />7/10
