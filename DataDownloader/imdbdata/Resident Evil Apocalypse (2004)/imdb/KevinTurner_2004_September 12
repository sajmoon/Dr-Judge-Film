This movie is great. I am a RE fan I've played the core RE games and I
for one did not and do not want to see a movie thats Just like the
game. RE Apocalyspe as with the RE1 have many of the game elements but
they have been switched around and moved all over the place. This is a
good idea that way you don't know what will happen every scenes. There
are parts in the movie that are not explained but like in the first one
they will probably have a 3rd installment that would explain some of
it. The mercenaries weren't explained in the film and the S.T.A.R.S
team had a shallow explanation. Some of the dialogue was PG-13 for an R
film. The strong use of women in the lead parts was too much for me but
its a great money making move.<br /><br />The finer points of the film was the nonstop action, The comic relief
was great,and the zombies where kind set aside as secondary threats. I
love the Nemis he was right on the money. The licker's were sad
compared to the first film. The K-9's were much more fun in this film.
The gore was notched up a bit but wasn't suspenseful like the slicing
dice scenes in the first film, that was great, all in all this film was
a ten. Well worth the 8 bucks unless you don't like zombies and video
games and just don't like movies in general and if thats the case why
are you reading this?
