2004_September 19 

Let it be noted I am a player of the games and one of the people out
there that thought the first R.E. movie was okay. Oh and I love Zombie
movies! I could not get into this movie though I really wanted to love
it.<br /><br />Story wise there is not a lot here but that I could have gotten by with
given some wild action, some gore and a lot of zombie crunching. The
special effects seem pretty decent as far as action shots mostly
involving the character Alice (Milla Jovovich) trying to out bad the
Terminator. But most of the Zombie shots are intentionally kept quick
or blurry (did we spend all our money on BOOM effects and not save any
for make up?). The Lickers are okay as far as CG goes but don't really
satisfy. To give credit though the Nemesis outfit is pretty cool
looking.<br /><br />The best sequence in the movie is probably the first meeting of Alice
and Nemesis. Actually liked the way this was choreographed to some
extent. Fun scene. But this movie really seemed to lack this focus
anywhere else and at best was an excuse to have some good popcorn. Not
horrible but not all it could have / should have been.
