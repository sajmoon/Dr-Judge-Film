How can you not love the action in a movie like this. Of course this
movie does seem to cater to the testosterone pumped males in the
audience, but I see nothing wrong with it. Speaking from the point of
view of not having ever played the game that much, I probably miss out
on many little errors and what nots. But I spoke with some friends who
played the game and they told me that they would get flashbacks all
throughout the movie. No surprise the plot line is just a continuation
of the first movie. In classic sequel style there are more zombies and
there are meaner and bigger zombies. And of course the movie ends nice
and open ended leaving the door wide open for another follow up. Seeing
as how the amount of action increased from the first to the second. I
can't wait for them to make a third. Does this mean that we will get a
third hot female actress in mini clothing.
