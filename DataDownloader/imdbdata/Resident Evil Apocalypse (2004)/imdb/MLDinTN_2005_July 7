but I find the story line exciting. The sequel begins with a little
back story of how the first movie ended. Then it picks up with Alice
walking the streets of Raccoon City. I don't follow the video game, so
I don't know if this film is following the game story line, but I liked
where the movie headed. Alice meets up with another hot bad *ss chick,
Jill Valentine, and some STARS members as they fight to find a way out.
They are given an offer by one of the Umbrella's scientists- if they
find his daughter, they can escape on a helicopter.<br /><br />During this time, Umbrella activates the Nemesis project, who turned
out to be really cool. Nemesis is the guy from the last movie who's
been turned into a monster. The monster makeup looked cool. My only
complaint is the movie needed more Nemesis footage. The two fights
between him and Alice were kick *ss. Who knew Milla could be so tough!
And the ending just left me wanting more. Now there needs to be a third
sequel. I want to know what happens when an evolutionized Alice leaves
the city.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: If you like horror and especially if you liked the first
film, then this is a must see. It may be a B-type film, but it's fast
paced, and has cool fights, and a bad guy you want to hate.
