I hired out a copy of RE:A recently, mainly because it has the German
Actor Thomas Kretschmann in it, he was very good in &quot;Stalingrad&quot;,
&quot;Untergang,&quot; Downfall in the United States, and he was also in Blade 2,
and the Pianist as a German officer, like Stalingrad. he's one of the
few European born actors to have a career on the screen in Hollywood,
even if he does play villains, b/c he's German? Besides that the film
was worth watching, twice, and that's about it. The production team
focused on making the film seem as though it could happen in reality.
Ironically, the film was shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada during the
outbreak of SARS, which caused the entire city to be quarantined, very
much like the film &quot;Raccoon City&quot;. The production team attempted to
borrow from the game, as much as possible while still having a plot
beyond a simple Duke Nukem style shoot em up. I have not played the
game version, and probably still will not play it. Given the current
trend for Super-Heroine films with a slightly film Noir feel, it is
only a matter of time before BloodRayne gets on the big screen with
either Franka Potente or Michelle Rodriguez as Agent Rayne. Back to
RE:A do listen to the commentary and explore the special features, it
does not make the film worth purchasing, but it does amuse, which is
all this film is intended to do.
