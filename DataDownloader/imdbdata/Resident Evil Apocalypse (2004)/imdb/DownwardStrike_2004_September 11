I had recently re-watched Resident Evil. I really really liked it. So I
went and saw RE:2 last night. I sat in the third row, in the middle. I
was furthest up. I was shocked by how good the movie was. Milla
Jovovich was fantastic, Sienna Guillory was a remarkably Jill
Valentine. It was nice to see Alice kick massive amounts of rotting
ass. The cemetery scene is killer. All and all its worth the nine
dollars. In fact, I'm going to see it again. It was frightening and
amusing and the effects were awesome. I was totally blown away by the
ending. I will say one thing though, the scariest part of the movie is
seeing Angela Ashford. The little girl, the red queen. Its just...
freaky.
