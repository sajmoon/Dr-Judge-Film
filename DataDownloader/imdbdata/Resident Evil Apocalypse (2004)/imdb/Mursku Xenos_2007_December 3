Whats with all the hating? This is nowhere near the worst movies ever,
like some people try to claim. Its probably just a taste thing, as i
thought this movie was awesome. Its like if i had to review a romantic
comedy, I think I would give it a 1/10 no matter how good it actually
was. As i cannot stand them. And from reading some of the reviews by
the haters, i think the same thing is happening here. They go and watch
the movie expecting it to be like the game, or a regular zombie flick,
or full of gore and whatnot and when it isn&#39;t what they expected, they
come here and write their hate filled reviews. And thats not cool &gt;:(<br /><br />This is a fun action/kung fu/zombie movie with some sci-fi thrown in
the mix (And by fun, I mean that I cannot remember the last time I
laughed this much while watching a movie, and i watch a lot of movies!
:D) So if you liked the first movie, you should like this one also
(actually i liked this more than the first one)
