I just watched this movie and it really got me staring. I liked part 1
(though many people disliked it), and I like part 2 even more. Sure,
it's nothing &quot;special&quot;, nothing big like LotR, but it's excellent at
what it actually is: an action movie based on a video-game series. I
love the style of the movie, the action scenes, simply everything about
it. The actors are good, and I think they did a great job at
transferring the story and characters of the games. I think it's cool
how they worked the opening of &quot;Code Veronica&quot; into the movie (the only
of the games I played through myself; really cool opening ;) ), and I
got a laugh out of the sentence on the movie posters ... &quot;I'm Alice,
and I can remember everything.&quot; I also liked the comic relief brought
into the movie with LJ. There were, like in part 1, several moments
where I thought they'd just end the film, but they always push it a
little further, and still, the end is as open as was the end of part 1
(which was very cool and fully in the flavor of the games, imho). All
in all, this movie shows great action, paired with two beautiful ladies
right in the middle of the action, and still brings those little jokes
from time to time. Really looking forward to part 3 :)
