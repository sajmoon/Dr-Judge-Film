After reading all the heinous reviews of the movie I went in to this
last night with ridiculously low expectations. To my surprise I
actually left the theater extremely pleased. I didn't like the first
&quot;Resident Evil&quot; film but this one was a lot better. There was actually
some sort of plot going on and the action was really great. Okay so the
acting wasn't stellar by any means but it didn't make me want to vomit
either. If you're looking to have a good time and aren't in search for
the next &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; then this would be a recommendation for you. I
am certainly looking forward to the third installment since they left
me kind of hanging at the end and I haven't followed the video games. I
also think they should have titled this one &quot;Nemesis&quot; instead of
&quot;Apocalypse&quot; because now they're going to be in a bind when they
actually get to the one that's supposed to have that title. Oh
well...I'm sure they'll think of something, they always do.<br /><br />Final Call:<br /><br />Movies : Enough action and special effects to make this worth the
ticket price.<br /><br />DVD Purchase : This may just be a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Rental : Yes but this one is better to see on the big screens.
