Was it just where I watched it, or was the volume cranked up for this
particular film?? I could literally feel the base reverberate inside
me.<br /><br />To be honest this was pretty bad, and for me that's saying something as
I can usually watch anything...The way the film looked and felt, it
seemed like a TV movie.<br /><br />As a lot of people have said already, the actions scenes were shot way
too quick and too close.. The acting was pretty bad and over the top.
There was no psychological tension in the way the film tried to scare
you, it was just with sudden loud(where i watched it, VERY LOUD) noises
with sudden extreme close ups. I could list every point what made this
film bad, but I'm gonna be writing too much as it is... One point comes
to mind, the STARS (referred to &quot;as the best&quot; by the Umbrella lady)
sniper sitting on the roof drinking beer, acting like a complete
redneck, this is the best? And the rest like running round like
headless chickens..<br /><br />The first RE, I thought was not bad but still very watchable. I cant
see how people thought this was better than the first one unless they
are very young and or true fans of the game..<br /><br />As a film, which it is, it was pretty pss poor..<br /><br />So far I cant believe how they've messed up 2 greatly anticipated
Sci-Fi movies this year, AVP and RE2.. Well, Sky Captain is spose to be
good.
