2005_September 15 
Forgive the crude review and its grammar and stuff as I'm dyslexic.<br /><br />The biggest problem in Hollywood now is giving work to people like
Anderson and Boll, who are pretty much dead weight. none of their films
are all that great(bolls are pure crap) and neither of the films have
any real originality.<br /><br />Resident Evil was basically a combination of James Camerons 'Aliens',
Renny Harlins 'the long kiss goodnight', a little bit of 'space odyssey
2001', and misc bits from other films like 'Alice and wonderland',
'dawn of the dead', and 'the matrix'.<br /><br />Re2 seemed to attempt to take more elements from the game which was a
good idea, but the nemesis was made a terribly generic monster that
could have had its ass handed to it by Jason Voorhees on a good or bad
day. The direction of Alexander Witt was on par with Andersons script.
Not a very good combination for movie goers as it was another PG-13
zombie film that only got an 'R' for lame nudity and cursing.<br /><br />I found it very hard to watch as I was quite familiar with Jill
Valentine, Carlos Olivera, Nicholai SOlokov and the Nemesis itself. And
ALL were done terribly, or made from bad guys to good guys(Nicholai,
Nemesis). Jill was thoroughly unlikable and Sienna Guillroy's
performance matched it very well, Oded Fehr as Carlos..well, he's too
old, looks nothing like the character but god almighty the man was the
only charming part of the film...Well, he and Mike Epps. I would have
rather seen these two guys put together in a zombie film as a swat cop
and a smart ass for about 90 minutes than watch RE2 again.<br /><br />And finally the nemesis itself...well the body proportions did NOT
match at all(Giant head, giant feet, long legs, stubby arms, stubby
torso and small hands)mix in the fact it was made into a complete pussy
of a creature well..thats pretty much all I can say. It was a stupid
silly monster that wasn't fun to watch and blended in the background
much like a lot of the performances.<br /><br />It's a stupid film with unconvincing special effects, terrible editing,
followed by terrible direction and writing.<br /><br />I give the film a 3/10. Go watch dawn of the dead or play the video
games instead.
