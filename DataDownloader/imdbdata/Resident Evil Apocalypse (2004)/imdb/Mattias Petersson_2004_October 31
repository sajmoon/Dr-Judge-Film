I didn't have very high hopes for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I thought
the first Resident Evil was a typical Paul W.S. Anderson outing.
Meaning an action film making a lot of noise and really trying to be
cool and heart-pumping, and failing in every respect. The first movie
was in my opinion slow, rather boring and with special effects that
needed a lot of work.<br /><br />I don't know if it's because Paul W.S. Anderson has given the directing
job to someone else this time around (he was too busy destroying the
promising &quot;Alien Vs. Predator) but something has at least changed for
the better here. The action scenes actually seem to have a pulse! We
are still quite a distance from what i would call &quot;blood-pumping&quot;, but
we're closer than in the first movie. <br /><br />The story here should be pretty easy to guess for anyone who saw the
first movie. The first Resident Evil ends with Alice (Milla Jovovich)
standing in what's left of Raccoon City. And basically this is the
plot, the virus is loose in the city. To make things worse another
Umbrella creation, the Nemesis, is also loose in the city and looking
for Alice. Oh well, the story seems to be more or less besides the
point here.<br /><br />So, what's good and what sucks? Well, as i said the action scenes do
have a bit more punch in them than in the first movie. Also they are
longer and seem to be made with a larger budget. The setting is also a
bit more interesting this time, an abandoned city is almost always a
good place to set an action movie. So what sucks? Well, Milla Jovovich
is still one of the worst actresses ever to star in a major Hollywood
outing. Also, and more importantly, i'm still looking for that
sensitivity from the director. That little special gift that makes the
action scenes leave you breathless. You know, that thing James Cameron
has?<br /><br />Anyway i guess for popcorn-entertainment a Friday night this is not too
bad. But don't expect to remember it more than a few minutes. I rate it
5/10 for effort.
