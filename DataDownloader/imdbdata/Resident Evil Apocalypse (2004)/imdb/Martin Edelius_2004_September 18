When you see a movie like this you should never go into the theater
expecting too much. Especially if it's a sequel. Fortunately enough,
Resident Evil: Apocalypse does a great job of following up to the, in
my opinion, very good first movie.<br /><br />The basic premise is the same; a lot of zombies that have been infected
by the T-virus are out to get our heroes. The difference is that this
time they're out and about in Raccoon city, the city where The Hive
from the first movie is located.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich again does a great job as Alice, with her this time is
Jill Valentine, known from the video game, played by Sienna Guillory,
whom also does a great job by the way. Not that there's a lot of acting
taking place, the better part of the movie the protagonists kill
zombies, blow things up or perform death, and gravity, defying stunts.<br /><br />This is what makes this movie so good though; the
over-the-top-with-tongue-in-cheek approach to the action. The first
time Alice enters the movie for real she does it in such a brilliant
way I almost clapped my hands.<br /><br />Take this movie for what it is, a fun action romp through well known
movie making territory, and you should have a great time.
