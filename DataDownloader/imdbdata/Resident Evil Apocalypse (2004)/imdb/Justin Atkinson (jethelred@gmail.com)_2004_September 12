I liked the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. I like Paul W. S. Anderson's other
films. I love the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; videogames. Horror films and
video game adaptation films both have soft spots with me. But man was
&quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; a terrible, terrible, atrocity of a movie.
E. Gad.<br /><br />There were too many retro-artsy shots of zombies in crowds. I'm not
paying to see random zombies moving in slow motion. I'm paying to see a
story, and maybe a couple of fights. At least I got the fights.<br /><br />There were a number of continuity problems. Okay, whoever edited a
scene where Jill makes a big deal about getting a second gun right in
front of a bunch of scenes with just the first gun, needs slapped.
C'mon.<br /><br />The dialogue was 90% explanation of things that I, a watcher of the
first film, already knew. The other 10% was the word &quot;fuck&quot;, which the
actors couldn't even say correctly.<br /><br />Mike Epps delivered the only worthwhile performance in the entire film,
but he felt so out of place that I felt more bad FOR him than
entertained BY him.<br /><br />This is the epitome of Hollywood using a popular title to draw a crowd
to a movie they spent no effort on.<br /><br />I gave it a 3/10. That was generous. I suppose you can appreciate this
movie if you're not smart, didn't see the first one, never played the
games, and don't know anything about movies. But especially if you're
not smart.
