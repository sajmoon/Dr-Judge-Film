It's very rare to combine action, horror, and humor in one movie, but
somehow they pulled it off. I'm still wondering how Mike Epps go t a
part in this movie. It's not that he made it worse, but to me he
actually made it better. It's amazing no matter what movie you put him
in he still acts hilariously ignorant. Had me laughing with every scene
he was in. This film was better equipped with horror than the first one
was. There were some parts where it was really surprising. Mostly it
was in the school. But the did better with the suspense. The action was
good, too. I was actually surprised. The action scenes were good and at
least this time there's a reason why she's such a gun expert and good
fighter. The first one became too unrealistic with the dog scene.
Overall, the movie was good. The whole movie pretty much held my
interest and is was worth watching. Kudos
