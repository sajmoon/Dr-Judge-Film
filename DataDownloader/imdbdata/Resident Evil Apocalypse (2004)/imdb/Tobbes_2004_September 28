Where the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; did quite well in capturing the look
and feel of the video games while also managing to score as a
surprisingly good horror film, this second one fails in all points.
Nothing is left of those creepy tunnels of the hive or the scare of
zombies in the dark. Instead all is replaced by a whole city. Wisely
used, this setting would work as well as the first one. Instead, the
director uses it as a huge playground for stunt and demolition displays
of the most uninspired kind. He really likes to break glass and blow
stuff up. And he likes the female characters doing stupid and pointless
matrix-like martial arts. Another point for criticism is the way this
movie ist cut. Very often, the cuts are lightning-fast, jump around
locations and would suit a music video much more than a horror movie.
The same applies to the frequently used way to show moving zombies. It
is a strobe-like visual effect that results in staccato movement of the
zombies. For many visual and action elements of the movie, the director
doesn't use own ideas, but seems to have watched quite a lot of action
movies with similar content an tries to copy as best he can. Not much
success here. Reading this, you might ask yourself: O.k., there are
flaws in craftsmanship, but is there at least an interesting or in any
way innovative story to it? Well, no. <br /><br />Enough bashing now. So what is the recipe of the whole thing? Take the
Resident Evil concept, strip it down to only the action parts of it,
make up a generic story, stuff in two scanty-dressed heroines and a
rubber monster, stir well and blow everything up. Done. If this works
for you, you will be entertained. For me it didn't.<br /><br />Rating: 2/10
