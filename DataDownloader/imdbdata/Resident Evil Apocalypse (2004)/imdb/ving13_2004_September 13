Mike Epps as LJ is very entertaining and his character provides a few
moments of comic relief. His presence in this movie thus makes it twice
as good as the first one and sadly is the only good thing I can say
about it. <br /><br />What's not to like? Plenty. Many of the action sequences seem to have
been directed by Michael Bay on a big dose of meth and a six-pack of
Jolt. The result: a mostly indistinguishable blur of images. My guess
is that this technique negates the need for having to spend money on
the required special effects needed for clear footage.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in regards to the acting, I would have wished that some of
the scenes were blurred out so I could not see such pathetic
performances. I wonder if the actors involved were ever surprised that
an emotionless take was deemed acceptable by the director. So sad that
in a zombie movie, the undead emote more than most of the main
characters.<br /><br />Finally, the matter that annoys me most about this film is the
completely ridiculous scenes defying all logic. For example, people out
run bullets and missiles, deliver more damage with punches and kicks
than massive gunfire, and in one scene are even saved from an explosion
by a PLASTIC garbage bin! <br /><br />An almost complete waste of time and an insult to the intelligence of
the viewer.
