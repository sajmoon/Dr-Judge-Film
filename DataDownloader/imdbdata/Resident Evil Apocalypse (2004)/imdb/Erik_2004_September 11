Fine, mindless summer entertainment. Never mind that it must have taken
two rolls of duct tape to keep the other female lead's top from popping
off about three minutes into the flick (and the guns in the garters
made it seem like they were trying to so hard to make her Lara Croft it
must have been causing them physical pain). The paper-thin plot was
just enough to keep you expecting zombies to jump out from every dark
spot. The acting was just good enough to not be distracting (with the
exception of some ridiculously bad Russian accents - they had a trio of
Russian guards there for no reason whatsoever).<br /><br />Anyway, if you show up expecting to see the next Shindler's List,
please don't post your whining here because you got exactly what you
deserved. If you simply want to have a few good laughs and watch
zombies get blown away, then this is just the ticket... (6/10, which is
about as good as a zombie flic gets these days).
