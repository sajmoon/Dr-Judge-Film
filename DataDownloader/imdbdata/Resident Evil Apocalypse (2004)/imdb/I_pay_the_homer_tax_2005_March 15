why are people so unkind...? This film had a relatively good plot, some
generic funny bits, some very cool cinematography, lots of explosions,
really big guns and hot chicks wielding them. why can't simple minded
drones whom take film too seriously realist that this movie is only
mean to be fun, and it was and should be for any one who is entertained
by your above average action movie.<br /><br />very submersive and very, very entertaining. Enjoy some senseless
violence by renting this cool little flick Watch this if you liked the
first, or you love zombie flicks Don't watch this if you like the
Bridges of Madison county, love actually, the moulin rouge, if your a
chick (generally) or if you actually sat through all of how to make an
American quilt
