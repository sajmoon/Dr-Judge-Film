Everyone has been saying that this was the worst movie ever made... But
I don't think they realize that it's a sequel to the first movie and
therefore shouldn't be expected to be a masterpiece. people go into
movies with the wroooooooong expectations, I tell you what.<br /><br />As a big HUGE fan of the game series, I can safely say that this movie
is good throwaway fun. Don't go into it expecting Dawn of the Dead or
any other even moderately smart movie. It's all about the action,
explosions, monsters, and thin, thin plot that the game has. There are
a ton of references to the game series, and a lot of story elements.
It's not a direct re-telling of the game, and it's not meant to be.
It's an entirely different universe.<br /><br />*sigh* People really should cut this movie some slack because it isn't
*that* bad. There's so much backlash attached because of the recent
&quot;smart&quot; zombie movies (like 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead
remake), no one's willing to see this movie for just being what it is.
