Re2 is far better then the first film in so many ways firstly it has
got a far faster pace to it with the entrance of Alice being very
entertaining and their is a lot more zombie busting from every
character and it shows a great different to certain characters as the
scene withs Milla Jovavich are like zombie Kung Fu action while the
other scenes with the umbrella soldiers show some entertaining gun
play.Secondly it is a lot closer to the games with characters like Jill
and Nemesis finally making an appear.Thirdly the acting is far better
with the likes of Milla Jovavich making a great effort.The film is not
without it flaws as their is not much of a plot and at time it can feel
very stupid.The ending is a totally disappointment and is very
confusing but once you overlook its flaws you will find a pretty decent
film to enjoy.
