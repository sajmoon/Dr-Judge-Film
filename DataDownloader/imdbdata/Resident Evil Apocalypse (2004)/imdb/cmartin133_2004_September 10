Even though the fight scene between Milla and Nemesis was done kind of
poorly (the screen switches so much because of Milla's stunt double),
it still has a ton of really cool scenes and action, it's spooky, and
any fan of sci-fi thrillers will probably love this movie. Plus, seeing
Ms. Jovovich in her birthday suit is always nice ;) Some girls are born
to be naked....<br /><br />And then there's that one dude, LJ, his lines in the movie will forever
be remembered. But if you didn't like the first one, you're not going
to like this one, but there's a lot less down-time in this movie than
there is in the first one, this movie is pretty much open season from
beginning to finish, and Nemesis is one cool monster in this movie. I
can't wait for the sequel
