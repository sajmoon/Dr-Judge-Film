I guess it's pretty clear that this film was put together as an action
movie - so it's perhaps harsh to criticise other elements of it's
shockingly bad execution. However much I lament the fact that the film
didn't make more of such plentiful opportunities to provide something a
little more unsettling, and a lot less laughable - there remain FAR too
many irritations, clich&eacute;s and oversights to make this even watchable,
never mind enjoyable. I'm pretty tolerant when watching movies, and
will endure even the worst film in order to get the straight story, but
RE-Apocalypse is the CLOSEST I've ever come to turning the DVD player
off midway through, which is of course, an unspeakable crime, reserved
for only the worst films known to man! Such a shame, I had such high
hopes for it.
