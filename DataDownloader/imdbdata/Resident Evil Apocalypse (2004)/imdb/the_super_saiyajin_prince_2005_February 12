Well, what can ya say? Resident Evil Apocalypse followed the games in
the fact that, it kicked the ass of the first one just as RE2
annihilated RE in the game series. As to the movie itself, it was
pretty cool, though it had several BIG flaws that seriously bugged me <br /><br />1 - Nemesis, he was wicked up until he decided to turn good
guy...ruined it there, though I see why they did it.<br /><br />2 - Nicholai, sure he was played good, but Anderson totally screwed
with his character, he's supposed to be a cold hearted back stabbing
murderer, but he turns out to be a perfectly humane save your life
Russian...lame<br /><br />3 - Mikael, where was he? where? oh yes thats right Anderson had a
brain fart and named him Yuri -.- small detail but every little thing
helps, especially when ur an RE fan like moi <br /><br />4 - Lack of siggy characters...lets count - Jill, Nicholai and
Carlos...OK Nemesistoo i guess he counts, I was hoping to see some of
Leon...maybe not Claire...explain later <br /><br />5 - Alfred Ashford was also another faulty character, in RE Code
Veronica he's a perfectly mobile cross dressing whack job with a bolt
action sniper rifle <br /><br />6 - Don't think I have a number 6...but it was pretty great over-all.
Can't wait for Afterlife as it will take off Playstation 2's RE Code
Veronica X with Project Alicia, she will be a bad guy if this goes
through the way the game did, it could ruin it which ever way she goes
if its not done right. Either way, I could see Alice getting killed
off, I only guess that through Andersons words of &quot;I really like doing
Trilogies&quot; Well done Anderson, you've brought out a film that (while
isn't perfect) it was great...and done so Fox 20th Century wouldn't
butcher this movie like they did with AvP.
