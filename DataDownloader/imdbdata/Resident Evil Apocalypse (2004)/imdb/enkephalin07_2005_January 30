Like the original games and the first movie, this has the lurching
zombies and a population infected by a powerful and recklessly
insensitive megacorp. It has loads of firearms, comic-book action
sequences, and characters in contemporary clothing that are just
distinctive enough to look like comic hero costumes. It also has
homages to previous horror films.<br /><br />Every other Resident Evil game and the original movie has presented new
stories that take advantage of the setting, situation and themes
without disrupting the continuity, proving that it could have been done
for this movie. This movie deviates from the canons by reinventing
characters and running roughshod over the established story lines.<br /><br />Was this necessary? Viewers who've been following the story before this
installment will find the contradictions distracting. Audiences new to
the series could've been given a good story without revealing or
revising what had been served up before. Is it such a bad idea to give
them just enough to leave them wanting if you still have games to sell?
Resident Evil was rich with mysteries to be explained, new territory to
be explored, but instead of cultivating the franchise this movie
ham-handedly grabbed for the quick buck.<br /><br />Alice and Jill were easy on the eyes and very powerful action figures,
far too good at surviving to be good survival horror figures.
Superhuman kung-fu masters aren't exactly beating the odds as they
engage in battles that you know they'll win before they begin. Ho hum.
No suspense. No menace. Even the monster is just another action figure
in latex. I wasn't surprised to find Jill Valentine likable and
interesting because I never cared for her in the previous Resident
Evils. With that great a character discrepancy between the game and
movie, I'm pleased to see no adaptation of the characters I actually
did like (geniune thanks to Emily Bergl for dropping out.)
