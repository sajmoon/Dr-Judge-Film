Recently saw Resident Evil Apocalypse...oh deary me. I don't usually
not like films the way i don't like this. Just another movie for Milla
to run around in nothing. Not that thats a problem in other cases but
not Resident Evil. Should have concentrated on and developed Jill's
character. And nemesis...why did they make him such a push over. Didn't
quite get an Apocalypse as much as a little street riot. <br /><br />While it might be easy to blame Paul W.S. Anderson for this load of
dribble, lets put it this way. He only written the thing. Surely it
wasn't beyond newbie Alexander Witt to change what he thought was crap.
His style of covering fights sucks big style. <br /><br />A third one...only if they take on the lessons of the past.
