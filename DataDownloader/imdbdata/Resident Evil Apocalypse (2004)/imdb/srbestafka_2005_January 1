OK, I enjoyed the first one for what it was despite it being a Paul
Anderson movie...entertaining drivel but fun. This sequel is
unbelievably bad...I guess it does hit its mark though as a game
inspired film since so much of it is like playing a game...I would
still recommend it to see some truly bad scenes, bad acting, editing,
etc and to watch the DVD making of where everyone is trying to act
excited and making comments about how great it is...also props to the
comic relief dude from Friday...he had a couple of really funny lines.
His comment on why didn't you tell me you were bit MF'er, I was hanging
with you and everything was funny...as were his custom guns.
