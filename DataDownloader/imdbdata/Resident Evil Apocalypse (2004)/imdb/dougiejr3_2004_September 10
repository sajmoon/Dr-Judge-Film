This movie consistently flowed better along its story lines than the
first installment did. First of all, you've got to remember that it's
an action movie - and a sci-fi action movie at that - so there's going
to be some pieces that everyone would change. Especially the people who
have played the video games. For one example - the Nemesis, should have
been bigger, but again, it's a fantasy movie. As with all fantasy
movies, you've got your small selection of cheesy lines, but overall,
the movie was great - better than its predecessor. Milla did a
fantastic job and they had a great supporting cast. I will definitely
look forward to RE3, as long as Anderson directs that one as well.
