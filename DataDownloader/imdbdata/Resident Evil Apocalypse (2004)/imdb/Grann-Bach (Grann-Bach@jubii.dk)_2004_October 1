2004_October 1 
After having seen Resident Evil god knows how many times, and being
pretty psyched for the sequel, I finally got to see it, and on the
premiere night, too. Of course, I knew that the director of the first
RE, Paul W. S. Anderson, wasn&#39;t doing this, since he was busy making
his dream project, Aliens Vs Predator. Luckily, I can cope with changes
like that... as long as the change isn&#39;t devastating. For this movie,
however, it&#39;s hard to tell... maybe the mediocre attempts at scaring
the audience and providing shocks was Anderson&#39;s fault, as he wrote the
script, but it may be the new director, first-timer Alexander Witt,
who&#39;s responsible. Let me say this upfront; I, as many others who
enjoyed the first, really liked the ending, the whole foreshadowing
thing, and, thankfully, the film picks up exactly where the first one
left off. Actually, it goes a little further back, to show us exactly
what happened before Alice woke up. The plot is decent, about as good
as it gets when it&#39;s Paul W. S. Anderson writing it. It doesn&#39;t drag...
heh, it doesn&#39;t drag... heck, it doesn&#39;t even leave the slightest
chance for it to drag, as it&#39;s constantly moving. The movie never
allows the audience to catch their breath; apparently, someone(I&#39;m
guessing Anderson or Witt) has never heard of the danger of overdoing
action sequences. For anything (at all) to be good, entertaining,
thrilling, whatever... there needs to be what is commonly referred to
as &#39;buffers&#39;. Without those nice little talky-talky scenes in-between,
heck, maybe even a dash of good old-fashioned character development,
the action just ends up being trite. And that&#39;s pretty much what
happens here. They try to squeeze as much action into every single
frame as possible, and it ends up annoying the audience rather than
exciting. The director also has a horrible habit of blurring the image
whenever there are more than five zombies on-screen, apparently to (I
guess) cover up a bad job on makeup... or something to that effect. If
the first had too much make up and such, this has too little. The
acting is decent enough. Milla Jovovich gives the same good performance
that she usually does. The rest of the cast are acceptable. The
characters are mostly clich&eacute;s and stereotypes. Of course, by mostly I
mean almost 90% of the cases. You got the stupid reporter who just
wants to make a story out of all of this, despite her being in obvious
danger; The bad-ass cop who&#39;s suspended but still takes her duty deadly
serious; the half-witted pathetic guy who&#39;s obviously only there for
comic relief... actually, scratch that last one, as he was actually
pretty darn funny. For once the person who&#39;s supposed to be there for
comic relief works, instead of just being the *most*(or even worse;
least) laughable character. The special effects were well done, but not
spectacular. Definitely not the best I&#39;ve seen. The action was good,
but really over-the-top. The scenes with the Nemesis range between
being some of the best action in the movie to being some of the most
pathetic and smirk-inspiring scenes. The cinematography is nothing
special. The film introduced an unnecessary amount of characters, most
of whom are just fodder for the zombies or Nemesis anyway. The showdown
between Alice and Nemesis was somewhat pathetically staged, and
probably would have seemed out of place, hadn&#39;t the rest of the film
been of the same quality(honestly, it seemed like a video-game... and
while I am quite a big fan of them, I&#39;m considerably more interested in
playing them than watching them). That big ol&#39; hunk o&#39; biologically
engineered walking death was simultaneously underdeveloped(for what
they had him/it do) and overexposed. The film is noisy and loud, but
not as loud as the first film, and while the sound is often horribly
overdone, it doesn&#39;t distract as much as several other big action hits.
The film is also less loud when it comes to the soundtrack; it was nice
to have some change from the one-note *loud* heavy metal from the first
film. All in all, a pretty entertaining flick, but out of your mind
much faster than it got in(and that&#39;s saying a lot, believe me). If you
liked the first, are a big fan of one or more of the actors, or you
just have nothing better to do for 90 minutes, give it a shot. It kept
me watching through the end, and, despite a few disappointments, kept
my interest as well. It just didn&#39;t stay fresh in my head for more than
about fifteen minutes after the credits started, which is very little
for a film with so much going on in it all the time. I recommend it
only to big fans of the first or of Milla Jovovich. I suppose big fans
of Paul W. S. Anderson(they must exist, somewhere) will probably enjoy
it too. I will say that most who liked the first will probably like
this as well, but possibly a little less due to the lesser directing.
7/10
