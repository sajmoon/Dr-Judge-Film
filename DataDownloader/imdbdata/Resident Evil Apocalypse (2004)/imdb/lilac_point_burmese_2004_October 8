I was disappointed with this film. The action scenes were ludicrously
fast, you could not see what was going on! You never got a good look at
the zombies or the monsters really, as a horror fan I want to see the
blood and the bites and the killing! It was never really explained what
happened to Milla, and personally I felt they got a few ideas from
Alien Resurrection (the whole using mutations to whoop ass deal). The
ending was confusing and made me feel like I was watching someone
playing the game rather than a film version of it - I kept waiting for
her to advance to the next level. The first film was much better, a
good blend of horror and sci-fi action, good actors and you could
actually make out what was going on! And by the way is it just me or
was anyone else annoyed that the female STARS member was decked out in
a mini skirt, boob tube and army boots throughout the film like that
was completely normal mercenary uniform?
