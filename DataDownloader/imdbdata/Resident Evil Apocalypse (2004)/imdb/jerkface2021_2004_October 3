This was one of the worst movies I've seen this year. <br /><br />No, it WAS the worst movie I saw this year.<br /><br />Absolute garbage writing was god awful and full of cheddar.<br /><br />The special effects were as special as that classroom in high school
where they were taught how to tie their shoes.<br /><br />The only good part of this movie is when you can see my university
residence blowup (first building to the left of city hall) and the fact
that they didn't try to hide the fact that they filmed in TO. <br /><br />Is that the CN tower?<br /><br />I think it is..
