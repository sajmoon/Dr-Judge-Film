I like the movie because most scene in the Resident evil video game
came out in the movie. I like the movie for the fact that its full of
suspense. Some scene where in the movie has a relation to the video
game resident evil one is in the Church from resident evil 2 another is
in the City Streets from resident evil 2 another is Stars member
another is the mercenaries (carlos nikolai etc) and many many more For
those people who dint like the movie just buzz off OK? you dint play
the resident evil thats why you cant relate to the movie and don't make
your own story sequence OK? the director made it that way so if u want
your own resident evil then make one we don't care. I hope you will
make another resident evil Rok on.
