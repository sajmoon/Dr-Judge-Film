to investigate but the infected dogs, monsters and zombies has attacked
them and now going above ground to attack any civilians on Raccoon

Coporation are escaping the city before the virus affected the whole
town.<br /><br />But when Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris)&#39;s daughter Angie (Sophie Vavasseur)
finds herself trapped in the city after unexpected accident. Now
civilians from Raccoon City are trying to escape from the city but the
Umbrella Coporation, especially the man in charge Major Cain (Thomas
Kretschmann) won&#39;t allowed it. After he made sure, his men are blocking
all exits from the city. Now ex-cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory),
her partner (Razaaq Adoti) and an ambitious TV reporter (Sandra Holt)

Dr. Ashford promises Alice and the other survivors including two

them to safety before The Umbrella Coporation decides to use an nuclear
weapon to destroy the whole city by dawn. But the survivors finds
themselves chased by all kinds of trouble and including an mutated
monster called Nemesis (Matthew G. Taylor), who once was Matt.<br /><br />Directed by the first-time Alexander Witt (Who is a talented second
unit director and as well of being an second unit director of
photography). Witt shows some flair with action sequences, some decent
visual camera work, he manages to have an good cast here but although
Witt isn&#39;t quite as strong a filmmaker as Paul W.S. Anderson (Which he
wrote the script) did on the original. Witt uses too much of slow
motion at times, especially when the Zombies shows-up. It seems very
unnecessary, it has an very bad jarring feel to it and the sequel is
clumsy at times. At least, the actors kept it entertaining for the
right or wrong reasons. Since it has its shares of unintentional
moments.<br /><br />I have to admit, i hated this sequel. When i first viewed it on DVD
back in 2004. I was expecting to be creepy as the original did but i
didn&#39;t expect to be goofier in this one. I do like the idea in the
sequel that the zombies and monsters are running around attacking the
city. After just watching it again recently, i do enjoy a bit more than
i first seen it. But the sequel is still an mess with an truly flawed
third act and it has at least two endings in the feature. But although
&quot;Resident Evil:Apocalyspe&quot; was an improvement over the second one,
despite the characters of Jill and Angie are not in third film.<br /><br />On the Resurrected Edition DVD, this film is a double feature with the
original. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) and an strong
Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Which the surrounds on the sequel are
quite impressive at times, especially the Church sequence. On the
second disc, there&#39;s an additional special features were not on the
original 2-Disc DVD Set back in 2004. It would be nice, if the DVD
included three running commentaries tracks but they didn&#39;t. This sequel
is only for die-hard fans of the video game or the first film, although
some will admit... this is pretty lame half of the time. Super 35.
