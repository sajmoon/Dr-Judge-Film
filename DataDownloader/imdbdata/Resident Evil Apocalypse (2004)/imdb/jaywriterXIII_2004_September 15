2004_September 15 

Usually people go into films with preconceived expectations, and when
those expectations are not met that person is disappointed. I went into
Resident Evil: Apocalypse with lots of expectations, every one of them
was met, and part of me is still pretty disappointed. I enjoyed the
film, knowing before hand what it was and the mindsets it was made for,
but this was a case where I would have been overjoyed if Alexander Witt
proved me wrong and went for something more. <br /><br />My biggest complaint involves the writing and direction surrounding the
Alice character (nothing against Milla, herself, or her performance.)
So many camera moves, editing choices, scenarios, and ill-conceived
action cues came across as cheap gimmicks to pander to mindless fans
and elevate Alice to a larger than life, superhuman, camp comic-book
level that just did not feel a part of the Resident Evil world. <br /><br />Sure, making one of the main characters genetically enhanced levels the
playing field against the hoards of infected zombies and monsters, but
the beauty of the Resident Evil games was the fact that you played on
Umbrella's turf with a very distinct disadvantage, and there we had a
real reason to worry that the characters might not survive. Then again,
this film isn't made for those appreciative of a challenge; this film
was made for the people buying the strategy guide and downloading
walkthroughs since designer's have taken out cheat codes enabling God
Mode. 'I won.' Congratulations, I'm still not impressed.<br /><br />I praised Paul Anderson for excluding the game characters in the
original film. I for one realize Raccoon City has enough people in it
that we can focus on different people within the Resident Evil world
(hell, Resident Evil 2 on the Playstation followed new characters.)
I've played the games, and I never had any interest in watching a scene
for scene, character for character, non-interactive remake. If I wanted
to see Chris or Wesker or Leon, I'd play the games.<br /><br />The inclusion of game trademark characters has also killed suspense for
the film. Is anything significant going to happen to RE's precious
'master of unlocking' on screen? Answer: No on two accounts. 1, Capcom
won't let it happen, and 2, the obsessive fans will whine so loud and
long we'll never hear the end of it. As a part of the audience, how am
I supposed to be worried about the characters in this film when I know
beyond all doubts that nothing will happen to them in the end? The
games have suspense because Leon, Claire, Jill, and Chris can die at
any time. 'Game over man! Game over!'<br /><br />If you're going to include a trademark character, don't pander to
obsessive fanboys and show them doing nothing but kick butt without
getting a scratch (or the obligatory 3 hits that don't even phase the
good guys). Go ahead and kill off the trademarks and let the audience
know that anything can happen to anyone. Then they'll really have
reason to be worried about the characters that they care for. I mean
really, in a film like this the game-characters won't even get a story
arc. So why bother inserting game characters?<br /><br />Final set of irritations: the endless reminders that this is based on a
video game, reminders that all but halt the on screen action just to
reassure the fans who need it spelled out to them that this is, indeed,
based on the game. I do like and appreciate nods to the Resident Evil
games when done right. I loved hearing Jill say, 'We can run around
them (the zombies); they're slow.' I loved hearing sound effects from
the game, or when Jill went off on her own in the church to investigate
and stumbled across a set that reminded me of an early scene in the
first game. Throwbacks to the game are perfectly fine, but this film
wants to advertise them, wink at the audience, wave and get your
attention then point at 85 percent of the game elements (Jill's outfit,
the Umbrella logo everywhere). Then it's just obnoxious. (Thank God
they didn't recite the 'master of unlocking' dialogue from the game.)<br /><br />Anyway, praises for the film &#150; though Alexander Witt's direction
bothered me, I do think the film shows some promise for him. There's a
mixed bag of nice touches and not so slick moves combined in an 'eh'
way. Overall the film felt a bit shallow, like someone who's learned to
play the notes but not the music. Apocalypse is a pretty decent start,
granted, maybe Witt will learn the underlying music and soul of his
craft.<br /><br />Sienna Guillory notably stood out in my mind. As much as I did not like
the idea of Jill appearing in this film, it was interesting to see
someone suit up in the characters wardrobe, look and move like the game
character, and finally give a personality to that generic polygon
creation we were introduced to in the games years ago. <br /><br />Overall, the film delivers exactly what someone should expect from the
next generation of MTV action flicks based on a video game. It could
have been much better, but it was just meant to please and entertain on
the level of the lowest common denominator like just about any
horror/action flick these days . . .
