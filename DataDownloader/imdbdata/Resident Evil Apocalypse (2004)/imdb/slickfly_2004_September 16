After hearing about and reading all the horrible reviews for this movie
I figured it had to be a must see for me. I have been a fan of Resident
Evil and purchased my game cube specifically to obtain and play those
games. Even though I am by no means a huge gamer I truly enjoy the
games and love the movies just as much. This movie had lots of action
sequences and I think Milla Jovovich does an excellent job in it. I'll
be purchasing it to go along with the first movie and am sure a follow
up will be forthcoming based on the way this one ended. All in all I
think it ranked about a 7/10 and was worth seeing on the big screen.
For those of you who have never played Resident Evil I think if you
like horror and zombies and action you will also like this movie to
some degree.
