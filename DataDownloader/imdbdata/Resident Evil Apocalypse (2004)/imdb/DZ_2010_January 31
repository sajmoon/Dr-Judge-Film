In order to write this comment, I scanned the film by fast forwarding
to remember, did not watch it again, but still you can&#x27;t imagine how it
was agonizing. Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins with a bad opening
scene that everything is explained in a scratchy way and we see
pictures from the previous movie. As some people say, yes, mostly the
scenes that zombies appear are very odd, so frustrating, it is not slow
motion, it is not digital camera, I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it is
not entertaining for sure. Zombies do not walk very slowly and they are
not fast like the zombie movies called next generation zombie movies. I
cannot tell anything more! The whole movie is almost non stop action,
but every action scene is extremely tasteless and sometimes too showy,
so if you ask me no entertainment, I don&#x27;t know whether there is such a
word or not, but this movie is anti fun in most parts. Moreover, a
heavy rock music in every action scene, helicopter sounds, walkie
talkie sounds that&#x27;s what the director understand from stylish film.
Set designs are too superficial. There is a terrible looking and very
ridiculous monster called Nemesis (wow! Nemesis is in the movie! people
say) who can say only S.T.A.R.S. Even stop motion King Kong in 1933 was
much more impressive than this. The plot is nothing, uninteresting. A
high school student who plays the game would write a much much more
better script, I am seriously sure. In a scene, the monster and Alice
fight each other, but they are in a kind of tournament!! However, every
bad has its worse, it gets more and more ridiculous, tasteless. This
movie is the zombie version of Battlefield Earth to me, so the end of
the world!
