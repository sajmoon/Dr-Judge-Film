I didn't think it was possible but this film falls even shorter than
the first Resisdent Evil film. I bought the DVD only on back of the
brilliance of the game it is based on - what a mistake (anyone want to
buy it off me?) It bears no resemblance to the game other than two of
the characters and they are hardly 'characters'. Who was that English
(Austrian?) wheel-chair guy and who did he get acting lesson off - Vin
Diesel? Instead of spending money on bad effects they could have got
some decent actors. The nemesis creature, pant-wettingly scary in the
games is about as scary as Dan Acroyd in the film. At least its bad in
a funny way. This is the equivalent of a McDonalds in the film world.
Best viewed when on acid. -100/10
