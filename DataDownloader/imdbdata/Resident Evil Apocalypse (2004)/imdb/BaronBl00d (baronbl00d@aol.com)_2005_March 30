Milla Jovovich is back as Alice in this pedestrian sequel to a
pedestrian original. Alice breaks from her hibernation to walk into
Raccoon City amidst all the turmoil going on in a city ravaged by a
disease turning the dead into fighting machines. The Umbrella
Corporation manages to close the city gates and has plans to test its
newest creation/invention/experiment Nemesis. What takes place? You
know the drill: lots of killing, outlandish, excessive special effects,
lots of high kicks and stand offs between Nemesis and Alice, Diogenes
holding a lantern looking for a real actor and coming up short, and the
thinnest, most threadbare plot imaginable. I didn't like Resident Evil
uno, and I found dos to be void of any of the few merits the first one
was able to extol. At least in the first one, director Paul Anderson
was able to create some menace and mood - as if a real threat was going
on. This director, Alexander Witt, fails to achieve that. This film is
loaded with clich&eacute;s from the opening scene to the very end. I again
will say that it has a nice look to it but is void of any, and I mean
any, real substance whatsoever. Not letting Anderson off to lightly, he
wrote this vacuum of thought.
