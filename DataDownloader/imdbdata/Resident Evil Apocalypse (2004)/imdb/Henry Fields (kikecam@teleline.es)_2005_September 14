The action is so frenzied in &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; that you don't even
realize of what the hell is going' on. Or maybe I'm getting' old and
I'm not able anymore to catch as many frames per seconds as I used to
when I was a teenager... Tons of digital techniques
(Matrix-influenced), the shadow of latest zombies-cinema (Dawn Of The
Dead, 28 Days Later), and a story nobody really cares about (or did
you?). Everything en RS2 is just an alibi to show us the athletic
condition of Miss Jovovich and their &quot;partners in crime&quot;.<br /><br />It may look entertaining for the first 20 minutes or so, but that's
all. However, I didn't expect that much of a video game-based movie, so
it hasn't disappointed me. Resident Evil gives you exactly what you
expect: action, explosions, blood, and scary creatures. They didn't had
a bigger pretension, and that's good... (I guess).<br /><br />*My rate: 4/10
