This is a great movie if you look solely for action. If you&#39;re
expecting more, don&#39;t expect that. I wish that these movies followed
the games a bit more....but what are you going to do right? But Jill
definitely made this movie better. First of all she&#39;s really HOT and
she carries a gun, there is nothing better than that. Finally, a GOOD
character comes into the story. Milla Jovovich definitely plays her
part, but if it was just her, it wouldn&#39;t be the same. Although the
camera work was awful and there was barely any plot, the movie sells in
its 90 minutes of packed action. A 7 out of 10 is good enough for this
movie, but I wish it could have been more gory, but oh well......once
again 7/10
