I have been waiting for this movie to come out for about 2 years.
Expecting a thrilling action-filled zombie flick like its predecessors,
all I could find was one of the most boring, unthought-of and painfully
predictable films I had the misfortune of seeing. The action scenes
were scarce, too short and not particularly interesting; the special
effects were shallow, almost amateurish, and not innovating in any way;
and the plot was practically nonexistent. I kept waiting for something
interesting to happen that would justify my expectations, only to be
disappointed again and again with every passing minute. The only climax
in the movie was the opening scene. But even that was not much more
than a pale imitation of one &#x22;the matrix&#x27;&#x22; fight scenes.<br /><br />To sum up: you already watched all the interesting parts in the
trailer. Don&#x27;t bother with the rest.
