The visual effect was pretty good, I really enjoyed! There were a lot
of idea from Resident Evil 5 (video game) like the characters, the huge
zombie with the blade-hammer, and Albert Wesker was the same as we saw
him in the game (abilities, clothes, skin). But the screen-play was
awful, the plots just putted together without any concept. It&#x27;s a pity
because this film could be a very good one, but not this way. I have no
idea why don&#x27;t use the game storyline in this movie... And Mr. Scofield
as Chris Redfield, well it was funny to me:)<br /><br />So the visual effect was good, but the 3D was nothing extraordinary...
The story was lame, the screenplay was awful... What a pity...
