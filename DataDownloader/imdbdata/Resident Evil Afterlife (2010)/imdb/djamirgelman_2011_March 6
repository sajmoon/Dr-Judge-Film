Okay... It was BAD! It was a very bad movie. When I say bad, I mean it!
It&#x27;s bad alright. It&#x27;s the baddest ever! I know there&#x27;s no such word as
&#x22;Baddest&#x22; but It&#x27;s BADDD! Very bad. And If you still think this might
just be not that bad, then you are BAD for even thinking it!<br /><br />Let&#x27;s say... ammm... that it was not a bad movie. On that exact moment
I made myself very very BAD!<br /><br />I just sneezed myself. You know why? It&#x27;s because for a slight second I
thought it was not that bad of a movie. So god saw this and gave me a
flu!<br /><br />In short. It was a BAD movie! Very very very very very... baddd &#x3C;----
(Infinite)<br /><br />What can be worst? :)
