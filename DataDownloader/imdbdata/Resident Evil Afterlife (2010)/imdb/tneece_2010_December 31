I am a big fan of the Resident Evil movies, but Afterlife was beyond
boring, awful, predictable, &#x26; too much like the Matrix. I own the other
3 films, so naturally I went out and bought Afterlife on DVD before
seeing it. What a waste of money, even worse I can&#x27;t return it. My wife
and I both watched it and both were extremely bored. Too bad, now when
they do the last film (hopefully it will be the last film). I will rent
it from Redbox for $1.00, before I would ever consider buying it. You
guys really messed up on this one!!!! Do it right or don&#x27;t make a
movie. Period. Even the actors in the film, weren&#x27;t even good in the
movie.
