Series star Milla Jovovich returns as Alice for this 4th installment in
the Resident Evil film franchise, based on the video game series that
won&#x27;t stay dead. Also returning is her hubby Paul W.S. Anderson,
director of Resident Evil (2002). Alice is accompanied by game
protagonist Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). The two search the Earth for
survivors from a worldwide zombie infestation and find some people atop
a Hollywood prison. The plan is to get them to a rumored sanctuary
known as Arcadia. But trying to stop them is the evil Umbrella
Corporation boss Wesker (Shawn Roberts doing a really good Hugo Weaving
impression) who started the plague, and of course a variety of walking,
er&#x85; running dead. <br /><br />The Resident Evil film series is supposed to be taking place in the
&#x22;universe&#x22; created by the games. Newsflash, this isn&#x27;t Star Trek.
Focusing on anyone outside of the central conflict isn&#x27;t very
interesting. That explains why Alice is at the head of everything,
which conflicts with the story told in the games and confuses the heck
out of fans of the game series.<br /><br />From start to finish Resident Evil: Afterlife is a mess of
unexplainable scenes. I&#x27;d say it was confusing, but that word implies a
lack of understanding on my part. No, I&#x27;m certain that had I seen the
first and second sequels that there would still be no way to make sense
of this movie. Plot holes, contrivances, and silliness come at you in
full force. Since I can&#x27;t remember all the offenders, I hope to be
forgiven for the ones I miss. There&#x27;s Alice&#x27;s HD camcorder that is set
to record in only white, black, and red. There&#x27;s the &#x22;Executioner&#x22; who
appears in the middle of the city without provocation. Another strike
for his ridiculous weapon, an axe chained to an anvil&#x97;a sign that what
makes a fun game opponent doesn&#x27;t necessarily make for a believable
film character. This same game logic translates to the stupefying
nature of the &#x22;zombies&#x22; featured this time around who are able to
burrow and open their faces as though they are mandibles. This goes
unexplained in the film, but it&#x27;s a nod to the direction the game
franchise went as it moved away from the confinements of the zombie
definition and toward new outlandish territory. Lastly, my favorite
gaff involves the look of shock in the faces of survivors when Alice
attempts to land her plane on their building just after they were
disappointed that she may fly off without them, raising questions over
what they wanted in the first place.<br /><br />Knowledge of the game series is vital since carryover characters did
all their developing in the games. Characters created for the film are
either soon to be dead or stoic. A girl by the name of K-Mart (Spencer
Locke) is mentioned on occasion, and when the team finds her she
manages to go the entire film without a line. The central antagonist is
known in games as Wesker though I don&#x27;t recall his name being said even
once in the film and a cameo at the credits requires, you guessed it,
knowledge of the games and previous films.<br /><br />Not all is lost. Resident Evil: Afterlife is surprisingly attractive.
Since Avatar launched 3D as a high-profit concept to escalate ticket
prices, many films have tried to capture the same magic. Some resorted
to adding the 3D effects in post-production. This film, like Avatar,
does it in the camera. The difference in noticeable even if you rarely
catch a 3D film at the cinema. Anderson shows this off by taking every
opportunity to throw and point a variety of objects at the audience.
Alice may have as many guns as her frame can carry, but that doesn&#x27;t
stop fellow survivors from tossing her a pistol or submachine gun. Even
baddie Wesker gets into the act, needlessly tossing his sunglasses at
Chris (Wentworth Miller). All of this is done in slow motion and all
too often stealing the &#x22;bullet time&#x22; effect from The Matrix. Many
Anderson vets have seen his movies because he got his hands on a
franchise they care about, and they are often times disappointed at the
numerous opportunities he takes to slow down the speed of the action,
almost as though the goal is to bore the audience or stretch the
runtime to meet a quota. Oddly, his pioneering efforts may have finally
achieved notoriety thanks to the nature of 3D, because the slowed
action provides audience members the time needed to admire the view.
The crowning moment is the entirely slowmo fight with the Executioner
in the prison shower. Water is flying in all directions, blood
splatters on the lens of the camera, a giant axe is hurled at the crowd
(making you consider ducking), every element plays on the 3D gimmick
and to this date I have not seen a better sequence to showcase the
technology.<br /><br />Aside from the poetic nature used to hand justice to the bad guy,
little if anything good can be said about the writing. Too often I was
begging a character to make a quip and realize just how over-the-top
the situation has become. There are worse zombie movies, and there are
better. What saves Afterlife is an apparent dedication to production
values, even over producing the film with some lavish sets, effects,
and makeup (good to see that the girls found concealer in the midst of
the chaos). It never comes across as second-rate and its knee-jerk
pacing keeps you on edge. Almost a teenage gamer&#x27;s dream come true. **
