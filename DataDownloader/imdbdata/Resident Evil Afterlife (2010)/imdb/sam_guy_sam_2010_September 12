The movie was quite OK , absolutely worth a watch ,some quite good
scenes and with Fusion 3D camera it was a visual treat but it wasn&#x27;t
quite what i expected. I went in hoping to squeal with delight but
never happened so didn&#x27;t meet the expectations even the &#x22;hammer
monster&#x22; didn&#x27;t go nowhere near nemesis or pyramid head from Silent
hill, besides there were some loopholes in the story like where did the
hammer guy come from and who built him the hammer???? It was more on
the action and less on horror. I watched the movies at noon and it was
gone till evening , no after taste unlike other movies in the series.<br /><br />You can watch it and not be disappointed if you don&#x27;t go expecting
Resident Evil 2.
