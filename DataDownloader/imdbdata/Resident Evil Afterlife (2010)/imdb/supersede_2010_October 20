2010_October 20 
I&#x27;m sure this has been reiterated a lot, but this series of films is
drifting further and further away from any concept of the original
ideas ( from the video games themselves. ) With that being said, it&#x27;s
not entirely a bad idea to go on that path, but the films are terribly
inconsistent with each other. The 1st film was good &#x26; suspenseful like
a RE movie should be. The 2nd was tolerable and somewhat within the
plot of RE. The 3rd was the beginning of an end.<br /><br />I truly like some Anderson&#x27;s work as a director ( Mortal Kombat, RE,
Event Horizon ) but this was a terrible concoction.<br /><br />Milla is a solid actress and on-screen performer, but did we really
need to hear her sulk &#x26; pout about some plot that&#x27;s completely
irrelevant to the franchise? I mean it&#x27;s bogus how conflicting the
plots are to begin with.<br /><br />As for the 3D graphics ( this is the 1st &#x26; only film I&#x27;ve seen in 3D in
theatres ) I was utterly disappointed. Most notably when Alice throws
some ninja star type weapons at the camera. I mean, Underworld:
Evolution had an almost duplicate scene like that without any 3D and it
blows the outcome away. The only 3D viewing I enjoyed from this movie
was the Executioner Majini&#x27;s wet-room fight.<br /><br />You could say the film is unpredictable and will leave you on the edge
of your seat, but it also makes you question it in every instance.<br /><br />This film series would have been a tonne more appreciated &#x26; acclaimed
if it had followed the video games more closely and not drifted off. I
tolerated the 1st few with a completely made up main character /
protagonist because I was elated to see the series come to films. But
this film draws the line, sadly I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this film to
anyone.<br /><br />Let me put it this way; when Tomb Raider video games came to the big
screen they only needed a babe ( Jolie ) to fill any void and do some
action, because there&#x27;s not much history or plot to the games, sheer
action. But Resident Evil follows a strict timeline and maintains a
pretty consistent synopsis throughout the main games (
RE,RE2,RE3NEMESIS,RECODEVERONICA,RE4,RE5. ) I don&#x27;t understand how in
the 3rd instalment of Anderson&#x27;s films has the whole world gone
deserted, left to an underground secret agency.<br /><br />The biggest grudge about this movie itself ( and the series ) is Wesker
is only introduced in Extinction... He&#x27;s a vital part of the 1st video
game and an evolving storyline. This film series may as well have been
called something else, like Biolulzard. It goes from a serious film (
RE ) to a comical flick ( Apocalypse ) to a paranormal caravan (
Extinction ) and lastly a psycho drama ( After-Life. ) If there&#x27;s
another in the works, sure I&#x27;ll watch it because Anderson is capable of
quality, but this is a glaring example of misrepresentation. Capcom
should not have let you go on with a 3rd and 4th movie. I sincerely
hope Capcom allows a new team to interpret a new series of
films/remakes.
