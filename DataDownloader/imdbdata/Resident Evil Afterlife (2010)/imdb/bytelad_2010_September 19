This installment has probably ended the Resident Evil series for good.
There is absolutely nothing original or suspenseful here. The cast has
no substance, and the most interesting part about Alice&#x27;s character is
removed in the beginning of the movie. Every turn in the movie is
expected, and any intended excitement is directed at the wrong
audience. Anderson basically took The Matrix, The Island and Resident
Evil and combined them into one movie. I did however, love the use of A
Perfect Circle&#x27;s The Outsider remix for this movie. Oh man, it could
have been so much better. Shawn Roberts and Milla Jovovich were very
cool on the screen, but everyone else and the poor writing killed every
scene. Oh, and if you are planning to see this movie in 3D, don&#x27;t! The
3D glasses make it difficult to see, as most of the scenes are without
much light, and the 3D effects are less than amazing. When the movie
ended, I felt like I just watched a 10 minute commercial for the actual
movie, and the only ones who seemed happy with it were fans of Boris
Kodjoe. Save your money and wait for this one to come out on TV.
