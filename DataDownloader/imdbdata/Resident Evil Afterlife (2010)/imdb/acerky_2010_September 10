Resident Evil: Afterlife is the 4th instalment of the Resident Evil
series. Milla Jovovich goes back to do what she does best: kick ass.<br /><br />With a new villain, new location and a big man with a big axe, RE4 sees
Alice trying to find Arcadia, the so called last safe haven for
survivors of the T-virus. She finds her old ally Claire from the 3rd
film, who has lost her memory, and together they meet up with a new
group of survivors trying to get to Arcadia. Easier said than done when
they&#x27;re all surrounded by the undead.<br /><br />Jovovich and Ali Larter do well as the leading ladies of action, but
Shawn Roberts is basically just channeling The Matrix&#x27;s Agent Smith as
the villain Wesker, from the voice right down to the sunglasses. He
comes off looking like a video game character all right. Prison Break&#x27;s
Wentworth Miller does alright as Claire&#x27;s brother Chris, but still
sounds like Michael Scofield, as always.<br /><br />Roberts isn&#x27;t the only thing here that reminds me of The Matrix, all
the slow mo action sequences just screams of it too. But you know, it
just works very well. To his credit, Paul W.S. Anderson doesn&#x27;t pretend
to make a cerebral action horror flick, he just gives what his
audiences want: a bloody good time. You want blood, gore, monsters and
Alice looking awesome? They&#x27;re all here.<br /><br />The familiarity of it all might annoy you at first, but after a while
you&#x27;ll feel comfy and end up getting a real kick out of this.<br /><br />Bring on RE5!
