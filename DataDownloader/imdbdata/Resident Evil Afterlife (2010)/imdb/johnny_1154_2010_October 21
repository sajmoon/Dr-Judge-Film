Firstly, the 3D was absolutely terrible. I walked out of the cinema
thinking something was wrong with my eyes, but according to the rest of
the reviewers on this website it IS fuzzy! Very bad job, I found myself
watching half of it without the glasses.<br /><br />The acting, plot and script were all abysmal. The plot holes in this
film are ridiculous, you&#x27;ll find yourself attempting to piece together
parts of the story whilst the movie races from scene to scene.<br /><br />The characters are lifeless and boring. I was only interested in Milla,
for all the obvious reasons. Even so, I found Jovovich to be less than
impressive. I enjoyed the first three movies but Resident Evil:
Afterlife is no match for its predecessors.<br /><br />To sum it up: It&#x27;s a slow-mo pumped, plot less bore fest. HARDLY ANY
ZOMBIE ACTION!
