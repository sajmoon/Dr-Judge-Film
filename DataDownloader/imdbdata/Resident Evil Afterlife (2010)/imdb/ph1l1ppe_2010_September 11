I am sorry, but there is no way &#x27;Resident Evil: Afterlife&#x27; deserves to
be called a film...<br /><br />It doesn&#x27;t even meet the requirements of a film! The script was
designed like a video game. The concept is &#x27;explore a level, trigger an
event, beat the boss, repeat in the next level until you meat the BIG
boss&#x27;. There is virtually no story, no conflict, no character
development, which means no interest, no tension and no emotions.<br /><br />It was inspired by AND created LIKE a video game, EXCEPT that it&#x27;s NOT
a game (not even faithful to its source material)! So basically, what
is displayed on the screen is an expensive video that only works on a
visual level! I&#x27;m asking you... What kind of satisfaction or
entertainment are we supposed to get from our experience if it doesn&#x27;t
qualify as a film and doesn&#x27;t even get close to a game standard? 3D?
This is not an answer...<br /><br />That&#x27;s why I am so frustrated and confused! I am even more angry when I
think of all the filmmakers out there who are actually inspired AND
talented but can&#x27;t even secure $10,000 to make a remarkable indie film!
How come Paul W.S. Anderson was given $60 millions for this weak and
sacrilegious project when anybody else would&#x27;ve been shut down with a
better script? Anderson is not a bad director... He knows how to treat
an image. But he&#x27;s definitely not a writer! He should consider to build
a team to feed his imagination a little! Getting your inspiration from
a video game and from a dozen of other movies DOESN&#x27;T WORK! That&#x27;s what
I had to say about &#x27;RE: Afterlife&#x27;. And I feel better.
