I am a die hard fan of the Resident Evil video games. I still remember
the first ever part of the game when i heard about it from my friends
that a game has arrived which has totally changed the whole concept of
gaming. Wow!! the opening sequence of it, the game play, mysteries and
the real itching horror. I still do remember all that stuff upon the
first ever release of Resident Evil video game. So far, till date all
of these video games has surpassed the expectations of their fans. Yet
am not sure whats wrong with the movies. Why they doesn&#x27;t have a real
story line of the Resident Evil which is it&#x27;s identity? I was so
excited once i heard about the first movie back in 2002. And i watched
that movie with very high expectations but to my misery the first
installment turned out to be a crap. Not even touching 5% of the real
game. Many people would find all these movies very entertaining but
those will be the people who never played the video game and who don&#x27;t
know what this whole thing is all about! but I am sure that for all
those RE video game lovers these movies are disasters and pain in the
a**. Who the hell is Alice on the mother earth of RE?? why the main
characters are&#x27;nt in the lead roles? Jill, Claire or Chriss..huh??
Though I watched all the previous 3 movies with the same expectations
every time but i left disappointed thinking why did i waste my time and
ruined my imaginations towards the Resident Evil subject (Yeah! RE
indeed is a whole subject). This time ! I wont watch it. Never.
