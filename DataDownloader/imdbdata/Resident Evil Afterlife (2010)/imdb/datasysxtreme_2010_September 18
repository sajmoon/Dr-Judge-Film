Will not explain widely and i can only say...there were four of us
excited to go to cinema instead of downloading movie. The idea of 3D
resident evil was just to big to sit home and support pirates...<br /><br />Still i have to say...it would be better I&#x27;ve seen it prated cos&#x27; 30
&#x80;for cinema just wasn&#x27;t worth it! Movie is boring and has moments which
make you sleepy...I was disappointed in every way except Xpand&#x27;s 3D
technique which is amazing and breath taking! This movie, honestly,
does not deserve good rating.<br /><br />Still...go to cinema to watch your favorite genre! It is the only good
way of enjoying it!
