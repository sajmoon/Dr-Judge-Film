So Paul W.S. Anderson is back with another zombie techno action flick
and that is basically all this movie is. No tension, no scares not even
a decent plot, just a tough chick running around with guns and knives
with other survivors killing zombies although there is very few zombies
in this movie. With some stuff happening in 3D and the 3D in this isn&#x27;t
all that great. Paul W.S. Anderson made some bold statements about how
this is going to be the action movie of the summer and how he is a fan
of the video games this movie is based on. He is full of crap cause
this movie is a alright action movie but has almost nothing to do with
the video games. So the plot is Alice is back again and she is trying
to survive while trying to bring down the Umbrella Corporation that is
behind the zombie mayhem. Shawn Roberts did a pretty good job
portraying Albert Wesker, at least he got the attitude and voice down
right. Well to sum it up Paul W.S. Anderson took some parts from the RE
games even the creatures and randomly put them in this movie although
it doesn&#x27;t make any sense what so ever, with techno music and slow
motion thrown in. I give this movie a 5.6 for it&#x27;s sort of fun action
scenes.<br /><br />5.6/10
