Okay, the franchise is what it is. You must already be a fan of the
games or previous films to understand the characters and the thin plot.
However this film is visually beautiful and not short on genuine
action. <br /><br />I have been a fan of the games but not so much of the films. For me the
first movie is only worth mentioning but since then this is easily the
best. Okay there is not much character development and the family
reunion of Chris and Claire Redfield is some what puzzling as there
appears to be no case of &#x27;Hi claire what have you been up to all these
years&#x27;? Instead, this film is just action, action and more action and
to be honest I did actually enjoy it. It was just 90 minutes of pure
zombie and bad guy slaying. I imagine there was quite a bit of a budget
spent on this film as there was some fantastic real scenery from
airview of Canada, Northern America etc. And the special effects to
help produce a scary and frightening post apocalyptic world are
impressive. <br /><br />don&#x27;t expect too much of this film, it is cheesy, thin on the ground in
terms of a real plot and character development but is enjoyable for its
pure adrenlin fuelled rush!! Good stuff 7/10
