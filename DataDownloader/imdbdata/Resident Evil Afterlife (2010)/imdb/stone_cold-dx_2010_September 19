It is true that the movie without a story and clear .. Or otherwise
short but only the name of &#x22; Milla Jovovich &#x26; Resident Evil &#x22; makes you
do the impossible to see the premiere of the film<br /><br />To be honest... Bad points in the film * Short film * The story vague<br /><br />Good points * Certainly Name of Milla Jovovich &#x26; Resident Evil * 3D for
the first time in Resident Evil world that is very very very cool * Big
giant from Resident Evil 5 ... the video game * and a great many things
in the film .. wonderful and positive .<br /><br />I want to see a long and wonderful parts of Resident Evil in the future
and of course Resident Evil without Milla Jovovich is nothing<br /><br />and<br /><br />without comment and without the words ..<br /><br />i will give this movie 10/10 u can say biased or bigoted but anything
with the name &#x22; Resident Evil &#x22; i will give him the full mark<br /><br />yeah<br /><br />Resident Evil 4 Ever
