This film flew with colors and detail. Other than the past RE films it
didn&#x27;t put you in a situation where you were left waiting for the
action. From start to finish it is a fun and entertaining thrill ride.
The acting was awesome and the humor included seemed to be in the right
places at the right time. For a smaller budget and a smaller series I
could definitively tell they put everything into the film with what
everything they had. It was entertaining and the story seemed to suck
you in from start to finish. I LOVED the introduction. The Alice Clones
were KICK-ASS!! Go see it when you have the chance PLEASE!!! First of
all I would like to state that this IS a Resident Evil film. Soo many
people in the past have been negated and hating on a series that is
entertaining and trying to be original all on its&#x27; own taking. If its
not about similarities towards the games its about people hating some
cheesy or corny action scenes and dialouge that people bring up or hate
against or maybe seem to not even be in the film at all. I find that
people tend to want to negate the RE film series rather than make
positive statements.<br /><br />1. ONLY see it if you are at all familiar with the series of movies or
the video games. If you haven&#x27;t seen the movies or played the games
don&#x27;t be surprised if your confused and disappointed. A lot of people
tend to make this mistake and then make crappy reviews because it was
their fault they weren&#x27;t familiar with the Resident Evil genre from the
beginning. Don&#x27;t criticize on Afterlife if you haven&#x27;t seen the last 3
movies or played any of the games. Its not the movies or games fault,
its yours.<br /><br />2. Its critical to recognize this is a Resident Evil movie, so what you
got out of the last three in terms of acting and scares will probably
be around the same level of realism in this one. Although in Afterlife
the acting and the support in terms of scares totally upgraded and the
humor and realistic acting seemed to dwell within this film. The acting
was really attractive in this continuation of the series and that was
one of the many things that I liked about it.<br /><br />3. I saw Afterlife in 3-D and 2-D. Let me tell you the quality is 50
million times better in 3D. In 2D everything was not as crisp and clear
and the life the film was trying to convey in 3D can ONLY be seen in
3D...At least in the theaters anyways. So if you get a chance to see it
in theaters I highly advise seeing it in 3D. Its DEFINITIVELY worth the
money and time. You won&#x27;t be disspointed with your purchase.<br /><br />4. Lastly, Enjoy Resident Evil: Afterlife for what it is. Take the film
and series on its own and try not to compare or negate things because
let me tell you. If you don&#x27;t like the movies why would you continue
seeing them and if you didn&#x27;t like the story why would you bother even
wanting to see any sequels of a story you hated. This film is for the
FANS NOT THE CRITICS. So please don&#x27;t criticize. Thank You! And have a
Fun and Entertaining time watching Resident Evil: Afterlife.
