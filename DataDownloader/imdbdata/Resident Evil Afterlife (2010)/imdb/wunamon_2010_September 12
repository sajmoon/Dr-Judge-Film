This Resident Evil did for me what the previous versions didn&#x27;t. Yes it
did not truly stick to the video game story but it did offer some sort
of fan service. Resident Evil 5 players will understand. We from the
get go this movie jumps right into action with pacing I felt was up and
down. I couldn&#x27;t help but notice certain zombie movie clich&#xE9;&#x27;s here but
they were laughable and I doubt anyone will hold the director for that.
Alice is looking kick-ass and she does a lot of dead-ass kicking. With
respect to the 3D i think they did a good job. This movie I will
recommend to anyone who has been following the movie version of
Biohazard/Resident evil. It is a great movie that will entertain you
till the very end. Can&#x27;t say much without actually spoiling the movie.
Better go see for yourself.
