I have loved all the Resident Evil stuff for, well forever. I was
extremely excited to see this movie and I left the theater feeling
disappointed and tired. The writing was just sloppy, the action was
average, the plot was stretching, and it was 100% completely over the
top. It was just ridiculous. I wouldn&#x27;t watch this again. I&#x27;m sure
they&#x27;re going to try to do it again and do the same thing. Stretching
the plot and the characters way to thin, and at others times - putting
it on way to thick.<br /><br />But who knows, you might enjoy it - I just think it was boring and ill
written.
