Because I am in Amsterdam, and Indian movies are released here a week
behind the India release (with Dutch sub-titles), I was surely tempted
to see an American movie in Netherlands. Resident Evil: Afterlife was
released and in India had opened in full houses. The movie boasted of
great music, great action, great 3D, great star cast &#x96; a bigger canvas,
a bigger story and bigger stunts.<br /><br />I had also heard later that the movie is not good &#x96; except Milla
Jovovich. With this mixed reviews in my head, I went to see Resident
Evil: Afterlife in Pathe Arena theatre. Pathe Arena is a theatre that
is located a bit far &#x96; in South of Amsterdam. The theatre hall is good.
I think the biggest of all the Pathe theatres.<br /><br />I was happy to see many Indians in the movie hall. The movie unlike in
India &#x96; did not have an interval break in between.<br /><br />Now the movie. Milla Jovovich was fantastic, she carried the movie on
his shoulder. Not a single move of hers was out of place. Each
expression, each twitch on his face represented the emotion that was
undergoing the character.<br /><br />But the movie was bad.<br /><br />Shawn Roberts acted as if he was acting in his first movie. Kim Coates
looked starved to death &#x96; except her face &#x96; her body was ugly to look
at. Ali Larter &#x96; she had the best dialogues and punch lines &#x96; but he
does not have anything in him to carry off his character or such
wonderful lines. Though they bring some smiles on your face &#x96; the lines
were really good.<br /><br />The 3Ds were filmed nicely &#x96; especially the first outbreak of mutants
...<br /><br />This was the first time &#x96; I was disappointed by Masand Ki Pasand&#x27;s
review &#x96; who gave 2 out of 5 stars to the movie and appreciated the
movie by saying that the Director knows the what audience loves and
wants &#x96; and delivered that in the movie. I could not dis-agree more
with him. It seemed that Masand was blown away by the movie hall full
of youngster &#x96; in hyped first show; or may be Masand was paid (in cash
or kind) to write a good review by the Film Directors. All in all &#x96; not
a worth seeing the movie &#x96; except Milla. If you are Milla fan &#x96; go for
the movie.<br /><br />My brother roared about the high level of action scenes &#x96; but that too
can not help me say that &#x96; avoid this movie. It is bad!
