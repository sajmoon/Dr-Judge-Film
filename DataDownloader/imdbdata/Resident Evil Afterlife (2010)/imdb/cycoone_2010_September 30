One of the things I like about the Resident Evil films is that they
take the time to fill in the details while holding the audience in
suspense.<br /><br />This forth film completely falls flat on both accounts. Thanks to 2
dimensional characters, an overdone plot, and poor use of
foreshadowing, the entire film is predictable. At the same time it
doesn&#x27;t bother to show or explain how certain important plot devices
came to be. The movie reeks from it&#x27;s overuse of Deus ex machina.<br /><br />The special effects were the only engaging thing about this movie. A
lot of it felt like The Matrix in 3D.<br /><br />One other thing this film did well was continuity from the 3rd film. I
like that they didn&#x27;t spend much time on flashbacks while being
faithful to the events of the 3rd film.<br /><br />All in all my feeling after seeing the movie was that I was expecting
more. They could have made it longer, filled in some missing details,
developed the plot/characters more, and had a much more enjoyable film.
