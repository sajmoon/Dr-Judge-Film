Paul WS Anderson returns to his franchise baby with a new toy. Amazing
stereoscopic 3D the likes of which was used in AVATAR. And like any kid
with a new toy, he goes overboard sacrificing all substance for all
style. The silly excuse for a story begins immediately after Resident
Evil Extinction left off. If the movie was truly a video game, Alice
would be that idiotic hacker who got her hands on every single cheat
code. She got &#x22;GODMODE&#x22;, &#x22;AIMBOT&#x22;, &#x22;/KILLALL&#x22; and even a cheat for
&#x22;Ally NPC Spawn&#x22;. For the benefit of non=gamers, this just means that
Alice gots superpowers and gots a super-powered clone army too. Within
the opening minutes, Alice and clones stage a daring incursion into the
Tokyo facility of Umbrella corporation, causing chaos and ultimately
facing down the T-virus powered chairman, Wesker. The writer, also Paul
WS Anderson, must have known by now how quickly the movie would be over
since Alice could just pop the guy&#x27;s head like she did in Resident evil
Apocalypse. So through some stupidly convenient plot device, Alice is
superhuman no more and all her clones are gone. Now on the run, she
proceeds to Alaska in the hopes of reaching the last safe haven where
her friends fled to, a place named &#x22;Arcadia&#x22;.<br /><br />The mystery thickens when all she discovers is an empty landing field
and a deranged Claire Redfield (Ali Karter) under the control of some
weird biomechanical device. After saving Claire, the duo proceed to Los
Angeles where they encounter another group of survivors holed up in a
prison. With zombies all around and a new dangerous giant axe/hammer
wielding threat heading their way, Alice, Claire and the survivors must
find a way out ASAP. Their last hope may rest with a prisoner named
Chris.<br /><br />It all sounds a lot better than it turned out. Story-wise, it is a very
standard action movie narrative with maybe only one good twist. Though
the resident evil films have always been light on story, this one is
possible the lightest. The characters are the main problem. Anyone who
is not Alice is relegated to being a one-dimensional stock character
common in zombie apocalypse movies. You have a conniving a55-hole in a
business suit, the damsel, the rough-n-tough soldier, the big strong
African American guy and a token Asian dude with no attempt made to
make the audience care whether they live or die. Claire Redfield takes
over the role of amnesiac from Alice&#x27;s initial appearance in the first
movie, who slowly regains her memory and conveniently reveals the plot.
None of them are given any development at all. Even the main character
of Alice manages to be both uninteresting and underdeveloped; getting
no emotional closure after four movies.<br /><br />Paul WS Anderson, the baby with the 3D, must have spent so much time
making his wife look good on screen that he forgot not only to write a
good story but to direct good action. He blatantly rips off The Matrix
trilogy, Dawn of the Dead, and possibly Ninja Assassin. And by
&#x22;blatantly&#x22; it means lifting whole scenes to the point where it should
usually be considered a copyright violation. Almost 90% of the combat
scenes are in slow motion, easily reminding one of Uwe Boll&#x27;s &#x22;House of
the Dead&#x22;, complete with painful over usage of 360 degree panning and
other matrix bullet time effects. As a resident evil movie, Afterlife
commits the worse crime possible by having little Zombie killing
action. The very sci/fi-ish set up, the CGI cityscapes, lack of Zombies
and Milla Jovovich doing Gun Kata makes this feel more like
&#x22;Ultraviolet 2&#x22; than a Resident Evil film. <br /><br />Perhaps the one redeeming factors is how the franchise is trying its
damnedest to move back on track with the games. There are numerous
references especially to Resident Evil 5 and Code Veronica; the
Executioner, Wesker&#x27;s appearance, even that P30 bug thing just to name
a few. Alice no longer dominates the screen as Game characters like
Chris and Claire get their fair amount of time to shine. No doubt the
fan-boys might be more pleased than usual about this. Oh yes, and there
is Avatar-style 3D which just shows how weak the movie would be without
this gimmick.<br /><br />Like a shambling zombie in the movie, Resident evil Afterlife now plods
through the underworld. A sad Frankenstein&#x27;s-monster pastiche of past
action films with an erratic pace and a lack of good action. It has
become Paul WS Anderson&#x27;s vehicle to showcase his pretty little wife
and his latest gimmick 3D toy to the world. Among the Resident evil
movies, this one is has the least substance but the most style. No
doubt the slick 3D action would please the millions of simple-minded
adrenaline junkies. It would find warm reception too perhaps from fans
who desire something closer to that of the games (compared to past
movies), and maybe existing fans of the Resident evil movie franchise
who know what to expect.<br /><br />With the promise of a sequel, one wonders how much lower can the
franchise go now that its already all gone to hell. Well, At least it
is a nice looking and entertaining Hell.
