Resident Evil: Afterlife is one of the movies of 2010 that I have been
quite intrigued in because, as well as wondering how the tedious series
has yet again gotten another sequel, I actually started to wonder
whether this could actually be the Resident Evil movie I&#x27;ve been
waiting for. After watching a great trailer and some promising clips of
the movie and then seeing the movie, I suggest you just stick with the
clips and trailers because that way, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. So
taking off where Resident Evil: Extinction ended, Alice continues to
fight against the Umbrella Corporation with the help of &#x27;a few
friends&#x27;. Following new information, she heads to Los Angeles to find a
small group of survivors of the T-Virus outbreak. The survivors attempt
to seek out more survivors, escape the zombie-infested city and bring
down Umbrella once and for all. The first thing that sticks out like a
sore thumb in Resident Evil: Afterlife is the story and how confusing
it is at times. Luckily, I have seen Resident Evil, Resident Evil:
Apocalypse and Resident Evil: Extinction but if you haven&#x27;t seen those
then you may not find it easy to follow the story. The flashbacks don&#x27;t
do the story any favours because, even though they&#x27;re supposed to
explain things, they just confuse matters and aren&#x27;t really needed.
Resident Evil: Afterlife is all action and even then, the action scenes
aren&#x27;t worth going to the cinema to watch as the best action scenes
last about fifteen minutes (ten minutes if you take the slow-motion
Matrix effect out, which I will talk about later in the review). <br /><br />Granted that the Resident Evil movie series was more about action and
less about story but at least the stories in the last three movies
weren&#x27;t confusing and looked like a bit of attention went into them.
Resident Evil: Afterlife doesn&#x27;t have that same attention and instead
becomes a mess of all action and no story. The next thing the movie
didn&#x27;t have was hardly any character development or even characters,
they were all written so badly. There are only two characters in the
movie who have their own personality, Alice is obviously one of them as
we see her fight zombies and monsters with a disadvantage and Wesker,
fighting to make the T-Virus work for superhuman abilities shown in the
previous movies. The other characters blend in with each other and you
couldn&#x27;t care about them at all, none of them stood out on their own
and they were about as much use as a chocolate fireguard when it came
to surviving against zombies but they did have their moments. Another
thing about Resident Evil: Afterlife that isn&#x27;t so great is the acting.
Milla Jovovich and Shawn Roberts are great as Alice and Wesker but the
same can not be said for the rest of the cast. Ali Larter plays Claire
Redfield and she&#x27;s very wooden throughout most of the movie and doesn&#x27;t
convince you of her character at all. Wentworth Miller plays Chris
Redfield and has the same problem that Ali Larter has but his character
isn&#x27;t really given much to do, which is also another annoying thing
about the movie. We&#x27;re introduced to these characters and they&#x27;re not
given a proper story as to who they are and how they get there. They
tell us about themselves in a sentence or two and we&#x27;re supposed to
understand the character straight away. The script feels so lazy and
horrible and tries to answer questions only to have the opposite effect
and raise more. The movie felt like it was three movies mixed into one:
Alice bringing down Umbrella, Alice finding the survivors and trying to
find Arcadia and the survivors battling Wesker and therefore didn&#x27;t
feel like I was watching an entire movie. <br /><br />Read the rest of this review at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com
