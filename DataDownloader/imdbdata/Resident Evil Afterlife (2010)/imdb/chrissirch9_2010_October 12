Resident Evil Afterlife is an OK action flick. However those expecting
something ground-breaking will be disappointed as it really isn&#x27;t
anything beyond your typical action movie. The effects are good, and in
3-D I&#x27;d bet they are even better. However, as I did not see the movie
in 3-D, I cannot comment and therein lies my biggest argument with this
movie. Its obvious to me that this entire movies appeal comes from the
fact that its in 3-D and as a result, things like a solid storyline and
good old original action sequences are seemingly sacrificed to put
greater emphasis on the 3-D aspect. Because I only saw this movie in
2-D, its obvious I am missing out and that&#x27;s disappointing. I feel like
this whole &#x22;3-D&#x22; craze that&#x27;s suddenly hit the film industry has led
many movie creators to neglect the things that count in a film like a
good storyline, and are instead more concerned with making sure the
film has good 3-D effects. Resident Evil Afterlife is a prime example
of this.<br /><br />The bottom line here is only see this movie in 3-D. Without the 3-D
effect, you will be too drawn to how unoriginal and bland this film is.
Don&#x27;t expect an engaging storyline which draws you in either, instead
just sit back in awe at the amazing 3-D effects. After all, that is
apparently all they were concerned with when making this film.
