I really don&#x27;t have much to say. I found it to be slow. I don&#x27;t think
there was even one seen where they even attempted to startle the
audience. Out of the 4 RE movies, I found this one to be the least
favorite. <br /><br />They should have stopped at 3. I wish I could say more but it really
was...boring. Wait for the DVD if you&#x27;re going to watch it...IMO.<br /><br />I guess I give it a 5 for the remix song at the end performed by A
Perfect Circle. 5 meaning the rating goes up just because of the song,
without, the rating would be lower. Good remix of a good song.<br /><br />Is it too much to ask for a better plot? The action was OK in parts but
nothing different than what you would expect.<br /><br />I just hope they don&#x27;t make another.
