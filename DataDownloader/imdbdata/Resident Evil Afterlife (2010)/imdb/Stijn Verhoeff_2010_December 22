Loved the first resident evil films, absolutely loathe this one. The
only thought that went through my head during this film is, &#x27;Why...?&#x27;
Literally everything that happens, does so completely randomly, with no
explanation whatsoever. <br /><br />The special effects are preposterous and fake. You can see the green
screens; the fire of a gun nozzle which is focused on in the first
shot, magically disappears in the second shot; the shadows of the
animated doors weren&#x27;t even rendered. There is no proper plot and no
character development of any kind. This film, if you praise it enough
to even call it that, is an embarrassment for the film industry and
blasphemy for the resident evil saga. Then again, a film based on a
game based on a film is a ridiculous in the first place...
