Alice takes her army of clones to make Wesker pay. If you don&#x27;t already
know what that means, don&#x27;t expect this film to tell you. Anyway, after
that, she finds herself in the same situation as the last three times:
Trapped in the middle of somewhere, wanting to save everyone there with
her. No, really, that is it. As far as the plot(which is swiss cheese,
what else is new?) goes, I mean(and don&#x27;t expect it to hold up, make
sense, or explain much of anything). This is rather entertaining and
is, occasionally, effective in getting us excited and the like, in
fact, in those aspects, it&#x27;s the best of the four. Heck, in nearly all
regards it is, really. Action is cool(as are a few of the sets) and
surprisingly fitting in amount; there is the occasional awkward pose or
sequence, and slow-motion, whilst not always bad, is severely overused.
Anderson can come up with nifty ideas, but not all of them are as good
as he seems to think they are. Again, par for the course. He is getting
better(I keep watching his flicks hoping that that will happen, and
trying to figure out why he is allowed to write or direct), using his
own horrid(like faking us out by establishing something only to abandon
it, having chaos erupt out of calm, false tension, etc.) clich&#xE9;s
less(with that said, this has a couple of Hollywood ones) and balancing
things a little. The music is more appropriate and less noisy than the
others. Costumes are well-done(the Cronenbergs are a talented family),
with the Umbrella troops being faceless stormtroopers and the
unbelievably hot Jovovich&#x27;s(who doesn&#x27;t get naked in this one, breaking
the trend) outfit being the least silly since the original(in spite of
the cut-off sleeves, similar to the pants-legs of the last one). The
ninja-thing is enjoyable, and in general, if you liked the trailer(as I
did), and you know that these are stupid, you may very well get into
this(as I did). While this is still centered on her, Larter gets actual
screen-time here. Michael Scofield joins, adding nothing other than a
face-palming &#x22;joke&#x22;(care to take one guess where we first see him?) and
scowling(worse than in that show). Guillory as Jill only has a cameo.
So, Exctintion was one big set-up to this. Does it live up to that? Not
story-wise. Our lead loses her powers(she just barely used them!)
almost immediately, albeit without her becoming particularly
vulnerable. As sad as that is, honestly, at this point, it&#x27;s probably
too late to do otherwise. Maybe this should be the last one. I
understand this is the one most based on the games(I&#x27;ve barely played
any of them); it doesn&#x27;t get the mood of them right(why start now? The
original was eerie, the second was clearly inspired by RE2 and
3(without getting stuff right), that&#x27;s the closest they ever got).
There is zero character development. We don&#x27;t care about any of the new
ones(not that the old ones put us on any emotional rollercoasters).
About half of the one-liners are average(the rest are below). Dialog is
poor. Wesker speaks and moves just like Agent Smith, and that&#x27;s not the
only clear Matrix reference. This is shot with the tech of Avatar, and
the 3D does indeed look nice, and it&#x27;s used well and not
excessively(...well, a little is), and this is something that it is
made for. FX are well-done, if not stunning. The humor is OK; this got
unintended laughs, as well. There are jump scares, and they work. This
got and kept my adrenaline pumping, without my ever forgetting that it
was simplistic. As horror should have, there is a moderate amount of
blood, gore, disturbing content and strong language in this. I
recommend this to anyone fan of the movie series, forgiving lovers of
the video-games, and anyone who wants something to turn their brain off
to and just kick back with. 7/10
