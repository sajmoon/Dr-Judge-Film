I can mention at least 10 similarities between thiz film and &#x22;Matrix&#x22;
(1999)! Gun-fighting vs. a group of tactical team in hallway, smashing
into building window and firing back while it falls (with slow motion
too!), bullet time technique when the villain Albert Wesker is avoiding
the bullet, and even the villain character (Wesker himself) is Agent
Smith look-alike! (the way he talked and expressed), and many more.
Terrible rip-off! Thiz game adaptation is a sequel from three early
movies: &#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; (2002), &#x22;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#x22; (2004), and
&#x22;Resident Evil: Extinction&#x22; (2007). Paul W. S. Anderson takes back his
command as Director since the first franchise. In my observation,
Anderson is another &#x27;Michael Bay&#x27; type of mindless popcorn Director,
who always delivers mind-blowing action with extra excessive situation
and seems fully unrealistic, like what he showed on &#x22;Mortal Kombat&#x22;
(1995), &#x22;AVP: Alien Vs. Predator&#x22; (2004) and &#x22;Death Race&#x22; (2008).The
brainless main plot follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) continue to fight
against Umbrella Corporation, which is turning the world into
zombieland. Like the tag line on the poster says, &#x22;She&#x27;s back and she&#x27;s
bringing a few of her friends&#x22;, thiz movie is appearing all the
original characters of game version, such as: Claire Redfield (Ali
Larter), Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller), and Jill Valentine (Sienna
Guillory) although only appears as cameo in ending. There&#x27;s no
character development in thiz movie, everything is flat. It is 97
minutes movie with a bunch of slow-motion sequences. One thing is for
sure, in the movie like thiz you do not even have to worry during the
film, the main character won&#x27;t die in any circumstances. Prepare
yourself for another carousel ride!<br /><br />Visit My Blog on JONNY&#x27;S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com
