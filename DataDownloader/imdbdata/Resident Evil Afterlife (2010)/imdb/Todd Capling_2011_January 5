Milla is the movie. I would give it a 10, but I think they might have
used more animation of characters than I prefer. The story I thought
was brilliant. <br /><br />The plot was thick and the ending was - you&#x27;ll just have to see it. <br /><br />Milla seems to come alive in this series and this may be her calling. <br /><br />They should start production of the next Resident Evil immediately so
they can take some benefit when all is going so good. <br /><br />If your a Resident Evil fan: by accident like me.. your in for some
great movies. Milla your the best and hopes you keep it up.<br /><br />I really liked this movie and Knight and Day. <br /><br />Movies that were not liked: Inception and Shutter Island.
