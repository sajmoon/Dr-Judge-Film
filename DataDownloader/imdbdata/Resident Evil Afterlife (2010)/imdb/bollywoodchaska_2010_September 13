Resident Evil- Afterlife is full of action,horror and some thrilling
scenes .The Axeman fight is really a fantastic experience to be
watched. I have watched this movie 4 times since its release.One first
day ,i watched it twice.Those dogs are really masterpiece and reminds
the game-play of RE5.Wesker is now a powerful and intelligent guy in
movie.I loved every action sequence of movie and hope i am going to
watch it tomorrow again.If you love non stop action sequence and
stunts,it is movie for you,do not go for finding a story or logic in
movie,just watch and enjoy it.One more thing i love is shotgun fire
which comes with a lot of coins.
