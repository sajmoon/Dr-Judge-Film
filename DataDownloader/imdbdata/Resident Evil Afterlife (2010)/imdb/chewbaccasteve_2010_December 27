I hate having to write negative things but I feel my intentions are for
the best, those intentions being, of course, saving you or someone from
an hour long mistake. You might disregard these reviews because it is a
sequel but trust me, for the love of god don&#x27;t do it. This is kind of
like what happened to Jaws (4, a little bit 3) but a billion times
worse. 1) Awful cgi 2) Awful acting that causes brain tumors 3)
Terrible, terrible plot 4) Terrible zombies and zombie scenes 5)
Blasphemy 6) Side effects include: eagerly waiting for it to get
better, disappointment, eagerly waiting for the end (&#x22;can&#x27;t miss a
sequel&#x22;), fidgeting, temporary narcolepsy, you wake up and it still
isn&#x27;t over yet, then moments later the movie ends and you get in you
car to go back home and write a review about how you disliked this
movie and how quitting meth was way more enjoyable than this. I do
greatly enjoy the series and I hope these guys get back on track (using
good elements in their movies like the first through a majority of the
third) because they steered way off course with this one (what were
they thinking?).
