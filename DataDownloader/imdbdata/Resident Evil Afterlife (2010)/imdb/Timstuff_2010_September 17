2010_September 17 
This movie was not worse than I expected. However, it wasn&#x27;t really
much better, either. I&#x27;m not going to nitpick apart all the places
where it failed to do justice to the games it (falsely) claims to draw
inspiration from, and frankly there&#x27;s plenty of other stuff wrong with
this movie to warrant a bad review. Pretty mucht 90% of the movie is
shot in slow motion, and Milla Jovovich is still just as obnoxious of a
female protagonist as she&#x27;s ever been. Not only is she doing the female
equivalent of Christian Bale&#x27;s Batman voice for the whole thing, but
now she makes video blogs throughout the film to convey exposition,
which adds an extra layer of tedium to the film&#x27;s already tedious first
half. Secondary characters for the most part only occupy space (BTW, is
it just me, or does Ali Larter&#x27;s face constantly look like it needs to
be slapped?), Shawn Roberts eats the scenery like he&#x27;s in a fan film
playing Agent Smith from The Matrix, and there&#x27;s YET ANOTHER ridiculous
amnesia plot device thrown in to conveniently prevent Paul W.S.
Anderson from having to write convincing relationships between his
characters.<br /><br />This game does borrow a few elements from the games, but for the most
part it borrows from Resident Evil 5 which is unfortunate since that&#x27;s
one of my least favorite in the series-- especially the scarabs, which
IMO were a lazy plot device and they&#x27;re used just as lazily in this
film as they were in the game. Again, I don&#x27;t want to overemphasize
what was changed from the games, because even though these things are
frustrating to me as a fan they are not ultimately what makes this
movie bad. It&#x27;s Anderson&#x27;s ridiculously overwrought sense of &#x22;style,&#x22;
the brain-dead script, the acting which ranges from lethargic to
mustachio-twirling levels of ham, and the overall goofiness of the
whole thing. I can&#x27;t say I was disappointed though. It was not any
worse than what I expected, and honestly anyone ought to be able to
tell what kind of movies these are just by looking at the posters.
They&#x27;re essentially Paul Anderson&#x27;s multi-million dollar birthday
presents for his wife, who happens to play the main character.<br /><br />Also, I must mention the 3D, which is of mixed quality despite it&#x27;s
claims of &#x22;using the technology behind James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar.&#x22; The 3D
is just as spotty and obnoxious as the rest of the film, and when
things aren&#x27;t flying in your face, they&#x27;re either too blurry and
distorted to make out or just plain 2D looking. However, the extra $3-5
that it adds to the ticket prices has helped ensure that this will be
the most profitable movie in the series and that Paul WS Anderson won&#x27;t
stop making them any time soon. My patience for the medium is fast
dwindling, and I think next time I see a movie I&#x27;ll save a few dollars
and ask for 2D.
