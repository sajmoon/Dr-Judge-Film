Resident Evil: Afterlife is not going to be considered one of the
greatest movies of our time, nor would it be considered very good. RE
is an average film that has been made more palatable by the 3D camera.
While the acting, the story and the direction are all equivalent to a
straight to DVD movie, the 3D effects make is surprisingly entertaining
to watch in the theater. The story is so full of holes and bad dialog
that you have to be able to ignore all of that and allow yourself to be
engrossed into the 3D effects upon the screen. The 3D looks marvelous
and the camera makes the film come to life. One thing that is highly
irritating about the entire Resident Evil series is the consistent
effort by one corporation to destroy all of mankind. Let us be real
folks--people want power to have women (or men), money, to enjoy and
have things others do not have, to have the finer things in life and to
have control over others. If the world is gone--if everyone is
dead---if there is no money--then every single survivor in essence is
in power--but power that is not desired. That consistent drive to kill
everyone by Umbrella is just stupid and annoying.
