2010_October 9 
I am a fan of the video games series, and I really enjoy watching this
movie. Most of the enjoyment, however, comes from the anticipation and
seeing how elements in the games are incorporated into the scenes, and
I am very satisfied in this aspect, except for Wesker. I also like the
dark, mansion-like, claustrophobic feel that was the first twenty
minutes or so of the film, which brought back some good memory of
playing the playstation classics.<br /><br />But if you are not a fan of the series, game or movie, then this movie
is not worth the $15 ticket. First of all, this is an action movie, not
a horror movie. There are zombies/monsters, but other than some
suspenseful moments at the beginning, there aren&#x27;t no scares at all,
and the actions are quite dull.<br /><br />The fighting scenes are mediocre, and while there is lots of shootings,
there is not enough variety of guns/firepower, which should be expected
from a Resident Evil title, especially that which has a lots of
elements from the game RE5. I&#x27;m also quite disappointed to see
supposedly powerful bio-engineered monsters taken down with only a few
shots from conventional weapons.<br /><br />Plotwise, this movie has no plot, and no character development. Chris
Redfield seems to appear out of nowhere, with no apparent role in the
plot, probably just to please the fans. I also find this movie racist
toward the Asians.
