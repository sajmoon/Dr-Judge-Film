I signed up for an account just to warn anyone from wasting anytime
even looking at the case the movie came in. It is just awful. I
couldn&#x27;t finish. Please stay away. I think if they did the opposite of
everything they did to make this movie, it would have turned out
better. I&#x27;d rather have watched a blank screen for an hour and a half.
In fact if you&#x27;re looking for a good laugh which I imagine isn&#x27;t your
intention, this would be a good try. The acting is awful and so is the
plot. The gunfights wouldn&#x27;t even be enjoyable if it was a video game
and I was actually controlling her. I don&#x27;t think I could be paid to
watch this movie again, I would pay not to see it. While I realize I
didn&#x27;t put much information here, don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.
