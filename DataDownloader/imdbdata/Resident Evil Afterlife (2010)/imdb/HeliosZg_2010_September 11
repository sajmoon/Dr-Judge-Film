First of all, I must warn you: If you&#x27;re expecting Apocalypse all over
again, don&#x27;t! When I first saw the trailers I was looking forward to
Apocalypse (which is still my favorite part) on steroids and ended
getting a movie with much less super powered characters and Matrix
action. If you think realistically, it was a smart move to make the RE
movies more survival horror again, but I&#x27;m a huge action movie fan and
expected more action and crazy stunts from this 3D movie:/... There&#x27;s
still plenty of action, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but you can clearly see
that most of the 60 million dollar budget was spent on the first and
last big fight and influenced the script a lot. The special effects are
veeeeeeeeeeeeery good, but frankly if you&#x27;ve seen the trailers and
clips, you&#x27;ve seen it all... I would have loved to see more action like
there was in the first 15 minutes or so. They kinda wiped all the
sci-fi away and we were left with a not so scary survival horror movie
with great backgrounds and effects and slightly above average action
scenes. And you&#x27;ll be shocked to see what they did to poor Alice to
make her &#x27;&#x27;more human&#x27;&#x27; :rolleyes:... But all that aside, the plot is
fairly simple, kinda like a RE game back in the days when graphics and
character voicing weren&#x27;t that developed, so they had to keep a simple
story. So you could say that this movie truly is the best RE game port
to the movies, but it&#x27;s kinda not enough for the big screen movies when
you only look at the plot itself... But hey, we&#x27;ve seen much worse! The
acting wasn&#x27;t anything special either, but frankly you can&#x27;t expect
more from a survival horror... Still, the actors do deliver...
Especially Milla, oh I love her so much!:D And many may say they don&#x27;t
like the soundtrack, I love it! It packs so much adrenaline or a sense
of no hope... I&#x27;m interested to see what they&#x27;ll do in the next one
cause this one is clearly just and introduction to something new and
doesn&#x27;t bring a lot of story with it, plus they&#x27;ve really brewed some
stuff together that I have no idea how the characters are going to get
away after from, you&#x27;ll understand me once you see the &#x27;&#x27;ending&#x27;&#x27;XD...
To conclude, you should go watch this movie, but don&#x27;t expect it to be
like in the trailer or in the first 15 minutes... I&#x27;d still like to
comment on some decisions in the movie that I find questionable, but
I&#x27;d start posting spoilers then, so no...
