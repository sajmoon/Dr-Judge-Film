I loved the series. And I own the previous 3 Resident Evils. This movie
was the worse installment of the series. It was slow to start and I
kept falling asleep in the first 15 minutes. Where are the zombies? You
don&#x27;t see the zombies until the end and they aren&#x27;t zombies. They ran
out of ideas and rehashed the old villains from Tremors 3 and Silent
Hill. They lost the storyline in the script. The special effects were
good. But the fight scenes were lacking in action and drama. They tried
to make more prototypes of &#x22;Alice&#x22; and lost the sense of the original
heroine. I hope this is the last one, I won&#x27;t waste anymore time or
money on future installments. This series is one thing that is dead
that needs to stay dead.
