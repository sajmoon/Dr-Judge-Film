I have not to see the movie yet, but from what I&#x27;ve heard the critics
say they aren&#x27;t really good critics or thinkers.. I mean can we all see
the movie first dang. With the simple mind that people have now a days
before seeing the movie the critics would steal the shine when they are
simply viewers like everyone else and not a clue to what they are
criticizing on. Yeah they&#x27;ve said the movie looks like 3 different plot
scenes meshed into 1, but even I know of the reason why and Im not even
a critic. A smart person would know because they are all n 3 different
locations. The clones are in Japan while Alice is in Los Angeles duh.
There was also mention of the Axe man thrown in the mix without a
reason. On duh resident Evil 5 (the game) it was the same way the guy
just showed up without explanation. So why criticize the movie wen the
games just the same. We&#x27;ll I can&#x27;t speak for everyone else, but this
movie is a sure must see on my list simply because its entertaining and
a awesome movie. I say go see the movie for yourself the viewers always
disappointment and always bashing a good movie. They&#x27;ve got to see it
now its our turn And thats all he wrote.
