I&#x27;m not huge fan of the series but I did think the other movies were
okay. I never post anything on the web, at all, ever, but this movie is
so ridiculously bad that I was compelled to write something. Luckily
enough I didn&#x27;t pay to see this at the theater or rent it. Just now
streamed it on Netflix and was angered enough by what I saw in 5
minutes that I felt obliged to warn anyone who might read this before
wasting their time. This is a B movie under the guise of a Blockbuster.
I suspect the only reason it didn&#x27;t go straight to DVD is because it
was in 3D at the box office. I cannot stress this enough...this is one
of the worst movies I&#x27;ve ever seen. If you waste your time with this
movie you&#x27;re a fool. Don&#x27;t mean to offend. I&#x27;m a fool too because I
wasted 5 minutes on it. To summarize...NEVER watch this movie.
