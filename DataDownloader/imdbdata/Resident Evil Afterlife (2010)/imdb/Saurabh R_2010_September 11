The beginning despite being &#x22;inspired&#x22; from Matrix promised a lot.
Though all good things come to end but it should not be this quick. The
movie loses pace and viewers&#x27; interest as well. One does not expect
acting skills in movie based on a game and in this you should not
expect a &#x22;script&#x22; either. Characters come in abruptly and have no
defined role in the movie. Jovovich does what she does best but nothing
even close to special or jaw-dropping. Miller &#x26; Larter are the biggest
waste. But can&#x27;t blame the actors when they have no script to display
their talents.<br /><br />The few positives: 3D, background score and screenplay. Afterlife is
one of the better 3D movies. Very well shot with appropriate camera
angles, the screenplay is as per the requirement and the background
score when the action begins is impressive.<br /><br />Go watch only if you are Resident Evil fan or have nothing else to kill
time.
