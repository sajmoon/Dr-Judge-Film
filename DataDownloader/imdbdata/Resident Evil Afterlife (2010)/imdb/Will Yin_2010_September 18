Well, yes. I am well informed before watching this movie. Played the
video game from when it first came out. great video games, no question
about that. watched the previous series and that&#x27;s why I call myself
well informed. So I am not really expecting to watch a master piece or
well structured story or anything. But I do expect the 3D would worth
it since that&#x27;s the point, right? a 3D version using the name of this
series, is gonna attract fans no matter what crap they make.<br /><br />But, still, totally does not worth it. The storyline is moronic, the
action is sort of cool for the first 5 mins? Too many useless trash
taking most of the time and at 1 hour I realized the story has not
spread out yet!!!! There could be some scaring moment, cheap ones,
nothing you really can not expect. totally pointless movie and if there
is anything I acquired from watching this one? 3D won&#x27;t make a crap any
better. and sadly, that&#x27;s the 3 point I vote refers to.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t watch it unless you really wanna see Alice in 3D.
