2010_October 6 
Where to begin? I just laughed at the ratings for this movie. I think
this movie, is the most non-resident evil movie from all. When I went
to see this movie I thought I&#x27;ll see what the trailer first offered me.
Great visuals, amazing 3D but nonetheless non-stop action (that means a
lot of killings) and a logical story to continue the series but what I
witnessed was terrible.<br /><br />The story is that ridiculous I won&#x27;t even comment on it. It has no
logic, and it&#x27;s simply written just to add stupid escapes and stupid
action scenes that most part of the usual audience will find &#x22;awesome&#x22;.
Well it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s dumb. The first resident evil movie was good
so was the second but then they started to get more annoying than
anything. Now they came up with this movie which doesn&#x27;t even deliver
what most of the resident evil fans want. You don&#x27;t get enough killings
but you get a lot of pointless monologues and pointless remarks. The
twists are so obvious they might give you a headache. As far as being
concerned about the acting... well... guess what... that was terrible
too.<br /><br />The visual style the movie was so and so. And here&#x27;s why. Technically
the 3D was pretty good because it had some scenes that requested the 3D
technology but besides that there&#x27;s nothing else. I mean, the visual
effects are above average. You see that behind the actors is a green
screen most of the time and that airplane scene where Milla landed on
that building is the proof of that not to mention it&#x27;s another proof
for how stupid this movie is. The cinematography was very good but the
special effects just ruined the whole thing to me. The editing was so
bad as far as the sound goes. I just felt this movie was rushed because
you can&#x27;t have that bad of an editing unless you need to send the movie
and it&#x27;s not ready yet so you rush things up. The soundtrack or the
score or whatever you wanna call it started to be catchy but ended up
being dull and boring.<br /><br />Another thing I hated in this movie was those slow-motion scenes and
the action-scenes that rip-off The Matrix or Blade. You get one slow
motion scenes each 10 minutes for every bullet that gets shot. That was
hilarious and so irritating. This movie is just pathetic and not
original at all and judging by the ending there will be a Resident Evil
6 which looks even more stupid than this one. I just can&#x27;t stand when
you take a good idea and you ruin everything. You don&#x27;t have enough
action and the action scenes you have are dumb, you don&#x27;t have any
logic, you don&#x27;t deliver any interest in the characters in the movie,
you don&#x27;t deliver any atmosphere and when you have that music which is
a good choice but the effect is zero then things are pretty sad.<br /><br />This movie deserves &#x22;a big f**king fail&#x22; and I just lost 5 minutes of
my life to type this short-review.
