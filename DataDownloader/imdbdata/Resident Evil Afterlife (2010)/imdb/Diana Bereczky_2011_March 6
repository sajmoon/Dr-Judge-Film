I just saw this film with my boyfriend and it was so boring...I really
think they should stop with the whole Resident Evil franchise and just
keep making games. Like most people&#x27;s reviews that I have read, the
movie lacked plot and interest.<br /><br />The only thing I founded amusing was this massive guy with a massive
hammer which kind of didn&#x27;t look like it fit in with the film but
okay...Lets have something cool thrown in there. Oh, there was also
this whiny Korean guy who I thought had no real place in the film
either&#x85;His acting and his all around stage presence just shouts
boredom.<br /><br />Nothing is explained in this movie...Everything, happens out of
coincidence or...it just happens! Makeup and hair is beautiful on
everyone despite going through heaps of events. Food is available when
they&#x27;ve been deserted on an island for how many years now. There&#x27;s
ammunition here, ammunition there...Conveniently, no one runs out of
bullets really... Bad guys are mindlessly shooting people for no
apparent reason...<br /><br />The slow motionless of this movie just made me gag...Seriously, we&#x27;re
living in a world where slow motion action films no longer exist. It&#x27;s
just over the top, over exaggerated and over the top sequences which
leaves you bored. <br /><br />The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this movie a 4 is because it&#x27;s easy to
pay out. Oh, and I guess there were moments where I did laugh here and
there but yeah...<br /><br />I won&#x27;t be watching this movie again...EVER.
