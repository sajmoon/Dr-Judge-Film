Plot: As Alice (Milla Jovovich) continues her fight against the
nefarious Umbrella Corporation, she meets up with a group of survivors
in Los Angeles, who are trying to reach the safe haven known as
Arcadia.<br /><br />So far, here&#x27;s how the series has done, in my opinion: the first was
great, the second was horrible, and the third, though somewhat
laughable, was still entertaining. After seeing this one though, I
think the series is starting to go downhill again. The movie delivers
basically what you could expect: tons of zombie-killing action, some
cardboard cutout characters, and a useless story. Afterlife succeeds in
all of this.<br /><br />Aside from the lead performance by Jovovich, I could hardly care less
for any of the other actors. One of the unfortunately bad performances
actually goes to Wentworth Miller, who played an agonizingly hollow
Chris Redfield. And the story needed a complete re-do, because it was
almost pointless. One example is the use of the Executioner from the
game series. Though I thought his fight with Alice and Claire was cool,
I was completely puzzled as to what his purpose in the movie was.<br /><br />It does do well in the action sequences, including an awesome, though
short, standoff on a rooftop. But some of the action is overdrawn
thanks to the ridiculously large amount of slow-motion. If they ran the
movie without slow-mo, I bet the movie would lose half of its running
time. XD I also liked the soundtrack by media boys tomandandy and the
film&#x27;s use of 3D really helped during some of the more intense moments.<br /><br />Overall it does have its perks and the 3D&#x27;s good, but this is nothing
more than a one-trick pony. Believe me; I&#x27;m a big fan of the games, and
even I was disappointed.
