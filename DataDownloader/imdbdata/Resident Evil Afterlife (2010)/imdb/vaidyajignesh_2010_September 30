Its very big disappointment.After action packed first three parts this
fourth part is made to cash the popularity of the brand name &#x22;Resident
evil&#x22;.Who to blame,we can start from basic that is script,soul of the
movie,which is being taken for granted(I think we the viewers also
taken for granted)so there are many loose ends.<br /><br />From start we wait for thrills that never happens.Its seems that
director passes the time and at the end suddenly movie ends.There is
nothing like climax.I think after long time I saw so called action
movie without chilling, mind blowing action at the end.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t waste money.
