I normally enjoy Paul W. Anderson movies, such as Event Horizon, Death
Race and the earlier Resident Evil movies, even though I never played
the game. There always was a certain touch to it, something that
sticked with you. Like in Event Horizon where you really felt the fear
in many occasions and then after the movie is done you can&#x27;t stop
thinking about you being in such a situation.<br /><br />Now this movie right here. It didn&#x27;t have any effect on me at all. Why
are all the people top models? Why is everyone wearing make-up when
they&#x27;ve struggled to survive for years? Why is everyone tightly shaved,
all the time? Why do gun&#x27;s never go empty? The dialog is amazingly bad,
full of clich&#xE9;&#x27;s like: &#x22;Aahh a family reunion, how very touching&#x22;. Come
on, you can&#x27;t do that anymore. This is not the movie to whine about
stuff being unrealistic, but it wasn&#x27;t even tried. At some points I
even felt the special effects were bad and completely fake-looking.<br /><br />The only reason I remember the movie after watching it, was because I
felt disappointed in Paul W. Anderson creating such a bad action flick.
