I have seen all the Resident Evil movies and I must say, I love them. I
am, however very disappointed that they made this movie in 3D. I have
had may friends explain movies to me because I cannot see them. I have
epilepsy and cannot see 3D movies for fear that I may cause panic for
other moviegoers. Would you like to be in a theater and see someone
have a fit and ruin the movie for you? I didn&#x27;t think so. This 3D craze
has ruined the theater experience for me, and my husband and I go to
the theater often. I have seen 3D movies in 2D and the quality is
terrible. I know I am in the 1% of people effected by this, but I see a
ton of movies, and that list, I fear, is shrinking. I hate to think
that all movies will soon be in 3D and I&#x27;ll be left out in the cold.
