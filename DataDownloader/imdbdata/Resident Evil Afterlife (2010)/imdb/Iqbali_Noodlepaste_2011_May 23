i think this movie is the most hyped movie of 2010 but it hardly lived
upto its expectations. Paul &#x22;W.S.&#x22; Anderson has put in a lot of work
into this movie.But unfortunately script is way below average.The story
is nonsensical.Dialogues are irritating and the acting is terrible. I
don&#x27;t know what made Paul &#x22;W.S.&#x22; Anderson to chose this subject.Its
just made to show that Milla Jovovich can act, run around like a
chicken with it&#x27;s head cut off and fight.But even her acting is not
that good as expected.The heroine is just used for holding two guns at
once.So no point in saying that she is a terrible actress.One thing
this movie lacks is comedy.This could have been a better movie had
there been some comedy in it.Music is good enough and picturization of
songs is pretty good.Its worth watching only for savage bloodletting.
