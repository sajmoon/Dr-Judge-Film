Before I begin I&#x27;d like to preface this review with some background on
my taste in movies. It isn&#x27;t sophisticated, it isn&#x27;t special, it&#x27;s
actually pretty average. I enjoy action films just as much as the next
guy. Sit me down in front of a mediocre action film like Wanted, Ninja
Assassin, Death Race, or Crank 2 and I&#x27;ll enjoy killing a couple of
hours without a single complaint. Do they have flaws? Sure. Do they
have occasional stereotypes? Of course. Are the stories that great? Of
course not. But that&#x27;s all beside the point, the movies are all meant
to be enjoyed for the carnage that people enjoy in any action film.<br /><br />Having said that, I&#x27;d like to talk about Resident Evil: Afterlife. This
movie absorbs every bad stereotype from every bad action movie ever and
mashes it all together into one. Scenes that make no sense (a totally
normal human being walking away from a plane crashing into a mountain
at hundreds of miles an hour), fighting that blatantly rips off other
movies (the opening fight scene looked like a recreation of the lobby
fight in The Matrix), and insanely stupid transitions between scenes
(Claire magically has showered, put on makeup, and found clothing
before they get in the plane?).<br /><br />There is so much wrong with this movie I cant even fully explain it
words. Please don&#x27;t go see this movie. And if you enjoyed it, I truly
truly pity you.
