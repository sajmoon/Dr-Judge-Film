I cant even begin to explain how crap this movie is, don&#x27;t waste your
money...hell don&#x27;t even waste your bandwidth downloading it the movie
is utter crap. I&#x27;ve played the games (no super fan) so kinda know the
story but you have nothing to worry about if you don&#x27;t because this
movie has no story so even the random person walking in the theater has
just as much knowledge as the avid gamer who&#x27;s like WTF is going on?
Good thing this director doesn&#x27;t write books because he&#x27;d be cited for
plagiarism with how many scenes were stolen. All I can say is that I&#x27;ve
been using IMDb for like 8-10 years now and haven&#x27;t reviewed anything
but this movie was so crap-house I couldn&#x27;t help myself. IMDb reviews
on movies are horrible 7.2 out of 10 my god the reviewers on this site
are used to garbage, either that or the &#x22;reviewers&#x22; are people who work
for the movie it self and have to try and bump a movie so hopefully
they can screw a few out of some cash. Its time to start using
rottentomatoes for getting reviews.
