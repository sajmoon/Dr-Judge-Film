kind of visually attractive but the movie is really empty and hollow
with nothing at all. the worst movie of this series. even less action
less zombies. 3D thing didn&#x27;t much worked here. those slow motion
scenes really looks nice but reminds you just a glimpse of THE MATRIX.
really disappointed movie. It has no story, its way to unorganized, and
its horribly written. This is probably the worst installment in the
&#x22;Resident Evil&#x22; series. Its just so pointless. The action sequences
aren&#x27;t anything amazing and I felt as if I was watching &#x22;The Matrix&#x22;
most of the time. It over-uses slow-motion way too much to the point
where it gets annoying. Westworth Miller does a horrible job bringing
Chris to life. He was the worst performance in the movie and Chris was
not brought to the screen the way I always imagined him too. This
installment sucks , Like pretty much all of Anderson&#x27;s films, this one
is half-baked. The half that&#x27;s baked isn&#x27;t too bad, though. really bad.
no recommendations at all.
