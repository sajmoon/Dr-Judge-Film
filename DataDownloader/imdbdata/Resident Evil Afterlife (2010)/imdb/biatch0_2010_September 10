Surprisingly, Resident Evil: Afterlife appears to be thus far the best
action movie of 2010. Possibly because I wasn&#x27;t expecting much after
the blatant Matrix rip-off-fest that was the trailer.<br /><br />There is an actual storyline (I won&#x27;t spoil it for anyone) which isn&#x27;t
half bad... and that&#x27;s saying a lot for an action movie!!! Typically, I
don&#x27;t expect anything when going to watch an action movie, so take this
into consideration when raising an eyebrow at my &#x22;not half bad&#x22;
comment.<br /><br />Cast-wise; no complaints whatsoever. Then again, not many guys would
complain when the cast includes Milla Jovovich and throws in Ali
Larter. Wentworth Miller showing up in the context of the movie made me
/facepalm while I heard whispers of &#x22;Prison Break&#x22; and sniggering from
various other movie-goers around me.<br /><br />Action; this is where the Resident Evil franchise has always been
top-notch and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint this time either.<br /><br />Overall, I&#x27;d give it a 6/10. Minus 1 point for stretching the Resident
Evil movies just a little too much...
