So...Where do I begin? The film received a lot of hype on this site due
to it&#x27;s 3-D nature. I read so many comments claiming that this was the
best live-action film to utilise 3-D since James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar. I
personally thought the 3-D was poorly executed even though the director
utilised the proper technology in order to shoot the film completely in
3-D. During the film I kept on lifting my 3-D glasses in order to see
the difference, and apart from a very clear, crisp picture, I can&#x27;t say
that the 3-D added a significant amount of depth to any of the scenes.
So, if you are thinking of going to the cinema to watch this one in
3-D, my advice would be to avoid it at all costs...<br /><br />The plot? Well, it&#x27;s pretty much in the same category with the other
resident evil films, so if you are a big fan of the original on the
psone then you are going to be disappointed yet again with this new
instalment of the resident evil franchise. The acting is sub-par at
best, too many slow-mo scenes which are badly executed and a general
cheesiness to the whole of the film still exists.<br /><br />If you are new to the Resident evil live action films, my advice would
be for you to avoid it, as it will most likely feel like a waste of
time.
