where did it all go wrong? This was not the best game adaption to begin
with, for me silent hill is still the closest game to movie effort. But
I really love the first 3 resident evil movies, the third being my
personal favourite so when I seen a trailer a few months ago for
afterlife I could not wait to see this. Maybe that was the problem,
expectation.<br /><br />I have read some other reviews on this site and I am puzzled, maybe I
missed the point or I&#x27;m being to hard on the film? But for me the games
and the previous 3 films had all being about atmosphere: this has none
at all. It just rambled along until the next &#x22;slow-motion just for the
sake of it&#x22; scene, of which there are a lot (id guess 20mins of the
film is slow motion).<br /><br />I just don&#x27;t know what happened to the series, as I said I am a huge
fan of both the games and the films, barred this one of course, and
can&#x27;t understand how people can be so happy with this poor rip off of a
film. There are so many direct rip off bits from the matrix, the
obvious ones being the trinity style jump out the window from the
trailer and even Wesker looks and moves like an agent.<br /><br />But this said, the easiest job in the world is being a critic. I am
just so disappointed that it turned out like this, but I will just
cross my fingers and hope against hope the nest one is a lot lot
better.
