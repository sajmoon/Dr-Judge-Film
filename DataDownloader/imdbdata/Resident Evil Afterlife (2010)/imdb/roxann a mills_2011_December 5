I have to be honest and say that I&#x27;ve never liked zombie films until I
watched the first Resident Evil; afterwards, I was hooked. I recorded
the latest installment on my DVR, and waited for the perfect, cold
night to watch it. Fast forward to the opening title sequence which
immediately reminded me of the psychological style seen in current
Japanese horror cinema; it was a perfect nod to that genre, and a great
opening sequence, it gave me hope. Unfortunately, only minutes later it
sank like the Titanic. <br /><br />I don&#x27;t know if writing the following would be considered, &#x22;contains
spoilers&#x22; since reviews for this film are all over the internet, but
here goes; after watching the captivating title sequence seconds later
a male character with blond hair, who dressed, and talked like Mr Smith
(the Matrix) appeared; next Trinity made her appearance dressed like
Alice, or was it the other way around? <br /><br />The hot spark that ignited this film was turning into cold ash. spoiler
2: Alice appeared cloned in triplicate, wearing Trinities shiny black
leather suit, maybe she borrowed it? I could live with another sexy
woman in black leather if she weren&#x27;t nearly duplicating the shots and
effects in what could only appear as a deadpan comedic homage to the
Matrix. Sadly, the only difference here is that Alice was fighting
armies of Japanese soldiers instead of armies of Mr Smith clones. The
first time I saw these effects in, &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; it was exhilarating,
eight years later it&#x27;s sleep inducing.<br /><br />Sadly this sequel makes absolutely no attempt to stand on it&#x27;s own. It
simply regurgitates something our culture has already so fully
digested, which for me is the main reason it sank to the bottom of the
sea so fast. Maybe, this movie might have been served up best as a
comedic spoof. After all, to be fair,it showed us recognizable iconic
scenes from another film with it&#x27;s own actors,dressed exactly like
those other actors, which could only be interpreted as an intentional
lack of original content, so why watch? I found myself waiting for the
movie to shift gears and land me smack on planet,&#x22; Resident Evil.&#x22;
Instead it seemed entirely content to endlessly mirror shot after shot
of the same flurry of slow motion acrobatics and flying bullets. I
found myself waiting for Peter Graves to show up, fresh from the grave
, zombied face and all. No offense Peter, but really, it would have
provided much needed relief. Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t a comedy, and I
wasn&#x27;t laughing. <br /><br />I was really looking forward to watching another resurrection of Alice.
I wanted nothing more than to end my long day with a dark chocolate bar
and slide into the entertaining world of a slick zombie fest. I was
secretly hoping that Alice might find another love interest as sexy as
Oded Fehr, his smile alone kills me. I doubt there will be any more
resurrections after this one. I can only hope this zombie film lets the
dead rest in peace.
