I was bored in the initial 15 minutes of the movie itself. Seems like
the director went over the edge to feed us with crap. Initially i went
in with great expectations,part 3 of this series gave us enough reasons
to be frenzied over R.E:Afterlife, however,the movie fails to pick up
speed and also fails to deliver on the creative aspect of any Sci-Fi
movie.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are done fine,but, if you consider the art put in
the movie,you will have disappointment rubbed on your
face.1hour,25Minutes seemed like forever to me!<br /><br />If you are planing to watch that movie, i would suggest you, to
download it,and if you still can&#x27;t keep your money in your wallets,
Donate it but don&#x27;t waste it on this flick!
