We live in a time where entertainment can be mindless fun. So as long
as they do not try to be what they can&#x27;t. Then it&#x27;s good fun. &#x22;Resident
Evil: Afterlife&#x22; is not good fun. Why? Some say repetitive, others say
it&#x27;s boring, flat, dull and dark. Only when the action comes do we get
some real &#x22;cool&#x22; entertainment but that&#x27;s it.<br /><br />Heavily inspired by &#x22;The Matrix&#x22; the action sequences show no mercy in
assaulting the senses. It&#x27;s all there: slo-mo, bullet time, black
sunglasses, lots and lots of bullets and slo-mo explosions, everything.
Just add a few zombies to make sure they (the filmmakers) look like
they&#x27;re not ripping fans of the original games and film trilogy, and
make it part of the franchise. Apparently they DO rip off the audience,
there&#x27;s very few zombie butt-kicking than in the previous three; save
for that big brutal monster with the giant axe in the middle of the
film which gives the film one of its pluses.<br /><br />There&#x27;s virtually no story to speak of, just brief introductions to the
next action sequence (and at the ending, an inevitable sequel to keep
this dead horse running). Milla Jovovich looks good but she starting to
look bored. Ali Larter, Boris Kodjoe and Wentworth Miller don&#x27;t even
bother about characterization apart from the fact that they look fit
and hot. The cinematography, production design and visual effects are
solid but the complementing music by Tomandandy is just too electronic
and distracting. It&#x27;s as if they&#x27;re trying too hard to be hip.<br /><br />Speaking of trying too hard to be hip, the Matrix-inspired action has
3D to make it look even better. I&#x27;ll admit, director Paul W.S. Anderson
really jumped on the 3D bandwagon and put it to good use. The 3D is
solid, with the bullets and blood and that giant axe all flying toward
the screen and towards the audiences&#x27; faces.<br /><br />Which brings me to the question: why bother? 3D is meant for
fantasy/sci-fi films with out-of-this-world situations. It does not fit
in any action/horror film, and it is NOT supposed to be used as a
gimmick. People don&#x27;t go to the movies to see the 3D as advertised;
rather they go to the movies to watch a story and get into a
fantastical world. 3D can be used as a tool to get them immersed into
that world (e.g. &#x22;Avatar&#x22;, &#x22;How To Train Your Dragon&#x22;), not as a tool
to show off and be proud of itself. And that is exactly what happened
to &#x22;Resident Evil: Afterlife&#x22;. The film&#x27;s action sequences in 3D is
merely exploiting the format and is equivalent to an outdated old man
wearing hip-hop clothes and screaming &#x22;Hey, look at me! I&#x27;m hip! I&#x27;m
fresh!&#x22;. This kills the film and makes it look desperate and lame.<br /><br />I apologize to those who reject my review. There will always be lovers
as well as haters. These are just merely my thoughts, and who&#x27;s to stop
you from going to see the movie. But this 3D film is absolutely
pointless to watch in my humble opinion, with no standing out qualities
(apart from the pointless but well-made 3D). I&#x27;d rather not watch this
one again.<br /><br />Overall value: 34/100
