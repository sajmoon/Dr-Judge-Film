Firstly, I created an account on IMDb just so I could review this
movie. I wish I could have put 0/10 but I could only choose 1/10. I
don&#x27;t usually waste my time to review movies which I didn&#x27;t like but
seriously I have to get this out of me.<br /><br />Nothing is good in this movie from start till end. I would rather go
and clean toilets for an hour and a half.<br /><br />There is so much to explain on how bad this movie is I honestly do not
know where to begin, you have probably read it on other reviews so I
wont ramble on. I found myself laughing at the slow motion scenes which
happen every 2 minutes for no reason. I feel like an idiot wasting my
time watching this hoping it would get better, it just got on my
nerves.<br /><br />People actually pay money to watch these films, no wonder more and more
people are watching them online because the quality of films recently
is just so bad its not worth spending money to go and see them.
Everything is fake, there is no creativity in films at all, surely
there are smart people working on these films, cant they tell how
stupid and ridiculous the films are.<br /><br />Crap film, don&#x27;t waste your money, don&#x27;t be curious to watch it, end
of.
