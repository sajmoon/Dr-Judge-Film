Let me start off saying that I&#x27;m a big fan of the movies and games.
Afterlife starts off with an amazing opening full of energy and was
pretty intense. Then it continues on with Alice and her clones trying
to put an end to Umbrella. While the action is very good and always
gives us something new, afterlife kind of fails in character
development in which brings us new characters like Chris Redfield,
Wesker and other new zombie creatures like the Axeman for an instance.
The Axeman had no story whatsoever and I like that Paul through in
creatures and characters from the games but he also needs to give some
kind of explanation regarding their origin. Well, thing is when I saw
this super zombie appeared and saw him through out the film I supposed
that the creature was an experiment that Umbrella created to kill
Alice. That was my theory but other people wont know a thing and will
be like what is that thing? Chris was a good add on to the movie but
having him as a secondary character shooting pistols is just wrong and
besides there was like no development regarding the brother to sister
relationship(Chris, Clarie). I saw this film in 3D and its the best 3D
I&#x27;ve seen, ill give credit for that. Finally, loved the sweet action,
effects ,cinematography, the new creatures and characters but lacks of
a good script, character development, lack of gore and please for the
next film a longer run time at least 2 hours. Anyway good addition to
the series. Still give it a 10 cause Im so fanatic.
