The so called Resident Evil movies are mislabeled, they&#x27;re not Resident
Evil, they&#x27;re just generic zombie movies with Resident Evil slapped
across the title, I still don&#x27;t understand how Capcom allowed the
movies to carry the popular Resident Evil name, they never stick to the
story, it has an amazing number of errors which include 98% of the
movie being not true to the actual story found in the games.<br /><br />In a Nutshell, disappointing. The movie was made into a damn action
film all over, there&#x27;s no suspense just incredibly cheesy action scenes
and weak tension, this is where I say Paul Anderson is an absolute
idiot.<br /><br />The people who like the movie series have obviously never played the
game or they have played the game but never got around knowing the
story well, if you did you wouldn&#x27;t be asking yourself throughout the
movie &#x22;what the hell am I watching?!&#x22; I give it a 1/10 mainly because
it doesn&#x27;t stick to the real story AT ALL, there&#x27;s ZERO suspense, too
many cheesy action and effects **I can&#x27;t emphasize more how cheesy this
movie is** and last but not least it&#x27;s not a survival horror movie,
it&#x27;s just a stupid action movie with zombies in it... quite frankly
Night of the Living Dead deserves more to be called Resident Evil.
