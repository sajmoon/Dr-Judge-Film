If you are a fan of the games you will enjoy this movie. Afterlife is
the most true to the series so far. Ignore the complaints of &#x22;no plot
or character depth&#x22;, they are simply not true. The plot is clear and
present for anyone who is paying half attention to the movie they just
shelled out $10 to see. I have read several reviews complaining about
the lack of zombies or the thin plot or even the fact that the bad guy
wears sunglasses, most of these reviews don&#x27;t even get the lead
characters name right despite the fact it is given a dozen times during
the film. Yes, Afterlife is not as zombie heavy as the first movie, but
not all of the games in the series focus solely on zombies. Why should
they when there are so many interesting creatures in the Resident Evil
universe? The most important thing to remember is that this is a action
movie based off a video game staring a super model! I mean that is
awesome, come on. It blows crap like Saw 25 or whatever number they&#x27;re
up to out of the water!
