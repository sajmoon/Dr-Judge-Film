2010_September 12 
The intro &#x22;action&#x22; scene I saw through my moronic &#x27;3D&#x27; glasses wasn&#x27;t
worth the plastic they were made from, never mind the idiotic and
contrived script vomited from the mouths of the &#x22;actors.&#x22; I almost
&#x22;LOL-ed&#x22; at the poor action-scene choreography... I did &#x22;LOL&#x22; at the
sad script Millia Jovovich was forced to puke forth in the first few
scenes... and the whole movie for that matter. Overall, the characters
were very &#x22;cliche.&#x22; Overall I give this film a 1 out of 10 because it
is an insult to any movie-goer, be s/he an action, horror, drama, or
comedy buff. Resident Evil:Afterlife has no place in US filmography...
even in its&#x27; Halls of Shame. I have nothing else to say other than:
avoid this movie at all costs unless you can see it for free and are
bored as hell.
