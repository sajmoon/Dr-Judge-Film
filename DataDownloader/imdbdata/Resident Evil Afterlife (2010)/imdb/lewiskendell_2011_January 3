Let me be clear, despite my slightly positive rating, Resident Evil:
Afterlife is in no way a &#x22;good&#x22; movie. But it is entertaining, in a
ridiculous, inexplicable way.<br /><br />I&#x27;m a fan of this series, even though that admission would probably
cause some people to doubt any and all of my credibility when it comes
to movies. The last three RE flicks were just dumb, fun action movies
with zombies, and I could appreciate them for what they were. No, they
don&#x27;t follow the games very closely, and no they weren&#x27;t scary in the
slightest, but I still liked them (to varying degrees). Milla Jovovich
is a credible and likable action star and seeing her jumping through
the air, kicking and shooting things in the face never really got old,
for me. Plus, this series has a habit of including some pretty hot
actresses in each installment (including this one), which I heartily
approve of.&#xA0;<br /><br />Afterlife, to be quite honest, is a train-wreck. But, it&#x27;s like a
train-wreck where no one gets injured, and the train cars do some crazy
flips in slow motion and there are tons of explosions and everyone who
happened to see it had a pretty good time watching it. Writer and
director Paul W.S. Anderson has completely (and wisely) given up on
trying to make these movies make sense in the slightest way, and let
all logic fall right off the B- movie cliff. There&#x27;s just so many
cheesy, absurd things going on at any given moment that it&#x27;s almost an
overload. The almost constant slow motion, the AWFUL acting, the absurd
dialogue, the concrete-tunneling zombies, the guarantee that exactly
every 3 minutes, a zombie or monster was going to magically appear
behind a character and kill/almost kill them, the random elements from
the games strewn about haphazardly...it&#x27;s all just so ridiculous.<br /><br />This truly awful movie appealed to me in a perverse way. It certainly
didn&#x27;t bore me, that&#x27;s for sure. But, you should be very wary if your
tolerance (and maybe even fondness?) for a disaster isn&#x27;t equal to
mine. Resident Evil: Afterlife destroys the limits of absurdity like
one of Alice&#x27;s shotguns to the face. And yet, after the extra scene
during the credits, I actually felt eager to see the next Resident Evil
movie. Maybe I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;s absurd. &#xA0;&#xA0;
