Resident Evil: Afterlife makes a valiant attempt to blend elements of
the previous films and the video games upon which the series is based,
but the end result is a lurching, utterly brainless product that is
unlikely to satisfy much of anyone.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her
continuing attempts to reach other survivors of the zombie apocalypse
while fighting off the evil Umbrella Corporation, which has not given
up on experimenting with the T-Virus despite its proved zombifying,
world-destroying properties. Along the way she runs into old friend
Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), a multiethnic &#x96; and therefore mostly
doomed &#x96; group of survivors (including Chris Redfield, played by
Wentworth Miller), and superpowered Umbrella Corp chairman Albert
Wesker (Shawn Roberts, who at least appears to be having fun in his
supremely hammy role). <br /><br />At this point, I&#x27;m fairly sure that the minds behind the Resident Evil
films have just given up. The film jumps erratically from slo-mo fight
scene to slow-mo fight scene, seldom deigning to exposit or flesh out
its characters; several seemingly important plot points are introduced
and then never mentioned again. The film attempts to throw game fans a
bone with the inclusion of Wesker and the Redfield siblings, but none
of these characters are given any significant development or purpose
other than to facilitate even more slo-mo fight scenes; viewers
unfamiliar with the game series are likely to be confused about why
these characters are in the film at all. The only real praise I can
give this film is that it&#x27;s occasionally entertainingly terrible (keep
an eye out for digging, swimming zombies!) instead of just
boring-terrible like Apocalypse and Extinction.<br /><br />Still: If you&#x27;re a fan of action-horror films, check out Predators when
it comes out on DVD. If you&#x27;re a fan of the games, wait for Resident
Evil 6. If you&#x27;re a fan of kick-ass women in movies, rent Salt.
Afterlife is a soulless, headache-inducing product without enough
brains to satisfy the most desperate zombie.
