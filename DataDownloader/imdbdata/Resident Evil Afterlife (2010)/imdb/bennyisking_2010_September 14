Guys if your looking to see a carbon copy of the classic video game I
think you should have realized by now that this isn&#x27;t it. But it is one
of the few series of movies that have been able to change the story
around and still remain good. It is a great action film. Maybe because
it was my first ever experience in an IMAX theater I am giving it an 8
but I highly recommend this film to anyone looking to be highly
entertained. I think Milla Jovovich has proved herself to be a bona
fide action star on top of that she is gorgeous. I actually think she
is a better action star then most men right now. Can&#x27;t think of any I&#x27;d
rank in front of her. Action junkies, fans of the first 3 installments
and people who love seeing hot chicks will love this movie. The movie
may make you jump a couple of times but nothing too scary or disgusting
quite simply put it&#x27;s Action all the way. The movie has it&#x27;s draw backs
there is 0 character development and you are expected to know who Alice
is going in. The other characters are really just there for Alice to
have someone to interact with and for the zombies to have someone to
kill. Unless you&#x27;ve played the game you won&#x27;t realize that Shawn
Roberts is supposed to be Albert Wesker, who by the way, looks EXACTLY
like Albert Weker from the game. This will leave you wondering as to
who this man and your left assuming that Alice simply has a personal
issue with Umbrella which he is part of. I&#x27;d see the 1st 3 installments
before seeing this movie. But even if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll have fun it&#x27;s
not that intricate of a plot where you&#x27;ll even really care. By the way
you&#x27;ll see a part where Ali Later is all dirty then suddenly she
appears on the plane gorgeous with make up and lipstick. Honestly while
her character development is very weak she does compliment Mila
Jovovich. The characters of Clair Redfield, Alice K-Mart and Luther
West all compliment each other well could have done without Mr. Prison
Breaks character, Chris Redfield, who always seems to play the same
character nonetheless it&#x27;s a really good movie worth seeing.
