What happened i was so disappointed the plot was horrible i liked
extinction much more because it actually had a good plot and
interesting character reactions and not only that it brought back the
tyrant. Also im confused why would umbrella keep experminting after
what already happened from what they did. Okay it was enjoyable and i
like the new characters but seriously this is bad. The other ones i
liked a lot more. Not to mention that this copy,s resident evil 5. I
knew it that this was gonna happen there was no story what so ever.
Okay if they are making another one and if they are gonna explain why
umbrella is doing something that doesn,t even make sense i will retract
this statement and delete this review until that comes this ain&#x27;t going
nowhere. I only recommend this to people who like action no plot type
movies
