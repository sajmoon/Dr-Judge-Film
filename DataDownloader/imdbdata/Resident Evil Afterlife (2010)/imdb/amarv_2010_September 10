Foremost, I like Milla very very much. Also I like the Resident Evil
movie series.<br /><br />Coming to this movie,<br /><br />1. The 3D is very very neat. (Probably because they didn&#x27;t converted it
from 2D to 3D in post production). 2. For the 2nd &#x26; 3rd movies of the
series, you may say the story was poor. But here you can&#x27;t even say the
story was pathetic because how can we use an adjective to describe
something which is non-existent. If you ever wondered how can anyone
make a movie without a story, watch this. 3. The fights and gore are
less compared to the previous movies. 4. It feels more like watching
someone play Resident Evil game rather than watching a movie. 5. The
fans of the game would enjoy this immensely because the movie has some
of the game&#x27;s creatures. But if you didn&#x27;t play the games &#x26; only like
the movies, then this will be a definite disappointment. 6. There are a
few good scares. A 30-something guy who sat beside me jumped at 2 or 3
occasions. 7. Milla is looking hot &#x26; younger as each movie progresses.
8. Overall acting &#x26; writing are not very stupid but the lack of story
really hurts.<br /><br />On a final note, 1. If you like the Resident Evil game series, you may
like the movie. 2. If you never played the games, but like the Resident
Evil movie series, this movie will slightly disappoint you. 3. If you
don&#x27;t fall in the above 2 categories &#x26; if you don&#x27;t like Milla
Jovovich, please don&#x27;t watch the movie.
