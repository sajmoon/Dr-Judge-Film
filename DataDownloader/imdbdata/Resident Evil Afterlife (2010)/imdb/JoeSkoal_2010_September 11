The 3D was good but not great. Very little zombie killing which was a
disappointment. All the good stuff was pretty much what I watched in
the trailers. This movie basically played on the idea that the first 3
movies were hits to fans so they add 3D and a poor storyline. I went
with all 4 of my boys and we all agreed that the villain acted more
like a poor impersonation of Agent Smith (Matrix) less the Carl Sagan
voice.<br /><br />Yes, this is based on a video game but the storyline missed the mark
for a 4th movie following 3 epic movies for Resident Evil fans.<br /><br />It is very hard to review this movie without spoilers, so I will leave
it alone and just say I would not see number 5 if it comes out. Yes,
this movie will leave you guessing at the end.<br /><br />This movie does not qualify as a followup to the plots of the first 3
and if you never saw the movie series you will still be disappointed.
