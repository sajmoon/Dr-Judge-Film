When you see such a movie you can&#x27;t expect a great story, deep
connection with the characters nor a good video game adaptation.
However you can have fun especially if you watch it in 3d the scenes
are quite amazing, fights are good,the music is thrilling and Milla is
hot! I don&#x27;t understand how people can&#x27;t get this and have different
expectations about the movie. It&#x27;s like a theme park ride, a fun one
and if you get it, you get it if not.. whatever. I enjoyed this movie
more than the first 3, probably because I watched it in 3D, the scene
where Alice jumps off the roof combined with the music got stuck in my
mind and is just breathtaking.<br /><br />TL;DR: watch it if you can enjoy a movie just for the sake of the
action scenes,zombies, effects.If you&#x27;re looking for something
original/deep maybe you should watch something else.
