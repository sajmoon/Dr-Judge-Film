Now, don&#x27;t take my review title the wrong way. Big and stupid aren&#x27;t
necessarily bad things if you find that entertaining. I happen to find
some big, stupid movies entertaining. This was one of em. Once again
directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, this film is the second best in the
series right behind the first film (possibly even the best), if only
because the action was so kick ass. <br /><br />The film once again picks up where we left off. Alice is still hunting
down Umbrella, while Claire has gone off to find the source of the
signal heard in Resident Evil: Extinction. However, not everything is
as it seems, and it seems Umbrella still has a plan of action.<br /><br />At this point in the series, if you&#x27;re expecting anything more than an
action packed, dumb zombie film devoid of scares, you&#x27;ve either stopped
watching the film or are fairly low in the intelligence department
yourself. This film is full plot holes, questions, and coincidences.
Overall, the film is pretty ho-hum. The story is straight forward and
of little consequence, and the disappointing ending once again leaves
the series open, doing away with the promise for the film series&#x27;
finale. But, with all that said, I regret nothing. The action was
highly entertaining, the acting was actually pretty good (as far as
this series goes anyway), and the RE fan service will bring a smile to
RE fans faces. <br /><br />The 3D is actually pretty good here, with some notably impressive
effects, including a bunch of water effects. The shower room scene is
simply fantastic in 3D. Anderson brings his Mortal Kombat A-game here
with the action scenes being very well shot and a blast to watch. I
won&#x27;t lie and tell you that this film really goes any farther beyond
that. For those that have seen ever RE movie in theaters, this is the
film that we had hoped the sequel to the original would have been.
Suffice to say, Anderson really is the only one who can handle it the
way it should have been done after the first one. The music here is
also fairly decent, with a nice soundtrack I will definitely have to
track down. It doesn&#x27;t always work, but when it does, it is pretty
cool.<br /><br />Obviously, this film isn&#x27;t a great one. It&#x27;s the fourth film in a
series that has degraded in quality over its course. Heck, it never
really won anyone over to begin with. However, my expectations were
pretty low to begin with. The prospect of Anderson returning, this
being the final film in the series, and the impressive trailers all
encouraged me to see this one final RE film. I can certainly say I
wasn&#x27;t disappointed, as I got just a little more than what I expected.
I probably won&#x27;t be seeing the film again (except maybe on TV), but,
for what I saw, I can say that I don&#x27;t regret seeing it in theater. And
if you&#x27;re going to watch the movie to begin with, you really do have to
see it in 3D. It&#x27;s surprisingly some of the best 3D I have seen yet
(and no wonder, with them using Jim Cameron&#x27;s 3D camera technology. No
post conversion doo- doo here).
