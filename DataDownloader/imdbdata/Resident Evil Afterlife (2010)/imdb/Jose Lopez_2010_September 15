I&#x27;m totally disappointed, I expect far more from the Resident Evil
franchise. This film is dumb, nonsense, even boring; the open and last
sequence are totally out of context. Even Milla looks bad, is like see
that Ultraviolet crap again !!. The 3D is fine but not enough to save
the film.<br /><br />The film rating over 5.0 is absolutely false, voted for brainless
teenagers !!. I&#x27;m never going to see a sequel (or video-game based)
movie again, before the votes on IMDb are over 10000. The first votes
come from the unconditional fans who overrated the film.<br /><br />If you like the previous films, don&#x27;t waste your money in this &#x22;thing&#x22;
-A zombie movie without zombies !!-
