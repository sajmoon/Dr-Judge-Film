The fourth installment in the Resident Evil film series has promised to
be an immersive 3-D experience. And it delivers on that front.
Unfortunately, that about all it delivers on. The story is miniscule at
best, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the gimmicks it tries
to throw in for fans of the games are downright insulting.<br /><br />PROS: The 3-D technology is amazing. Better than Clash of the Titans
and Alice in Wonderland, I&#x27;d say it could give Avatar a run for it&#x27;s
money. Paul WS Anderson also has a unique stylistic flair, and it
shows. He can produce cool shot after cool shot continuously.
Unfortunately, this is where the pros end because style alone cannot
make a film good.<br /><br />CONS: The story obviously. Is there really even one? Alice, the main
heroine, tries to find a supposed plague-free haven in Alaska only to
be lead to apocalyptic LA to find what? More survivors and undead.
While the cast is made up of talented people (Jovovich, Larter, Miller,
Kim Coates, etc.) They are given next to nothing to do except shoot,
shoot, run, run, scream, and shoot some more or die. One character
played by Kim Coates was a sleazy movie producer in the old days (still
sleazy) is supposed to be the comic relief. Suffice to say, he isn&#x27;t
funny. Characters and monsters repeatedly appear out of thin air. At
one point what must be a 400 lb creature appears out of nowhere to
dispatch a character, yet did anyone hear it coming? No. The Zombies
constantly growl and crackle at some points and then in a humongous
room can appear behind a character and surprise them. That lack of
simple care regarding small logical details pretty much sums up the
whole film. There wasn&#x27;t enough care or logic put into it.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: This film looks great in 3-D. Bravo to the filmmakers for
not just using 3-D to charge an extra $5 bucks, they worked hard to
make the 3-D worth it. But other than that this film is not good.
Story, character, and even suspense are virtually non-existent. In
fact, there is no suspense at all. I can&#x27;t believe it. The film does
have few cool moments, but other than that, is not worth seeing. Save
your money. I wish I had.
