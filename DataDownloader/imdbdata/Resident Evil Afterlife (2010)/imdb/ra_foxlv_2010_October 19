Tokyo slow-mo opening scene was amazing.<br /><br />Soundtrack is out of this world, it felt authentic but at the same time
brought back good old MM feel from original RE. I re-watched the movie
and almost every time I heard a track on background it felt as if it
was taken from some other movie (except the opening). Honestly, RE:A
doesn&#x27;t deserve it just because they are on completely different levels
but it saves the movie for me, plus the pacing of it.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a super cheese fest, sometimes I even felt as if watching a
Bollywood movie - on a brink of a laugh. At the very least I had a
grin.<br /><br />Performances. Well, Jovovich is good but best performance goes to Kim
Coates, even being as small as it is. And Wentworth Miller is so Prison
Break... seems like he adapts one attitude to everything, no diversity.<br /><br />Besides that I don&#x27;t like movies which change cameras for some of
scenes, they feel out of place, the well known FPS is different and it
just destroys that momentary believability you have, if you can have
one for RE:A at all.<br /><br />Yet I think it&#x27;s a good evening entertainment watch and if you have a
keen ear then the OST should become one of your favorites.
