Think Resident Evil the movies, and the first image that&#x27;ll come to
mind will be Milla Juvovich as Project Alice kicking zombie butt. It&#x27;s
been some 8 years since Juvovich became synonymous with the Resident
Evil movie franchise, and personally, I still enjoyed the first one
best, followed by Extinction, then Apocalypse for its really awful
story. If I have to rate this one, I&#x27;ll put it below the first and
third films in that order, where once again it has its special effects,
which is really an amalgamation of things seen before, to save the
movie from its weak plot.<br /><br />Paul W.S. Anderson goes back to the director&#x27;s chair after giving up
directing responsibilities for the sequels, assuming only producing and
writing credits, and although it&#x27;s widely touted as having used James
Cameron&#x27;s 3D technology, Afterlife hasn&#x27;t actually benefited from that
because of the way scenes were crafted that didn&#x27;t exploit that
technology fully like what Cameron did for Avatar. Either that, or
we&#x27;re already too tired with the gimmick, and this one doesn&#x27;t offer
anything new to provide any instance of Wow. We don&#x27;t require any more
depth in field please, at least some depth in plot rather than
something that looked to have jumped straight out of Prison Break.<br /><br />That&#x27;s right, Prison Break, with the largest tongue-in-cheek joke being
the casting of Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield, brother of Claire
Redfield (Ali Larter) who was introduced in the previous film. The
first shot of Chris was within a prison cell within a prison, and the
irony of it all is when he alone holds the key to everyone else&#x27;s
salvation from blood thirsty flesh lusting zombies trying to get past
the high walls and heavy gates, which they eventually do to provide our
ensemble human survivors, led by Alice, a fight sequence or two.<br /><br />You may grumble that plot is secondary here so long as we get to see
the hotness that is Milla Juvovich grace the big screen and doing what
she does best in the franchise. True, Juvovich&#x27;s Milla undergoes a glam
facelift from the grungy look in the previous installment, but even her
strikingly beautiful features can&#x27;t save the film from slipping into
the territory of bore. The prologue started off wonderfully though,
with its moody atmospherics to canonize how the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s
T-Virus got unleashed, and picked up from where the last film left off
with the salivating promise of a whole bunch of Alice clones all
waiting to be awoken to kick Umbrella&#x27;s behind. Once the fight sequence
is over, which included a nice way to get rid of Alice&#x27;s
invulnerability and god-like abilities, there&#x27;s only so much one can
stand on Alice flying around and lull you into a deep sleep with a lot
of voice-over mumbo-jumbo.<br /><br />Reuniting with Claire Redfield and trying to figure out the promise of
a zombie-free land in Arcadia mentioned in Extinction, Afterlife fell
prey to a bunch of movie clich&#xE9;s, that even you can guess who will bite
the dust first amongst a group of survivors, who will survive, who will
turncoat in loyalty, and so on. There&#x27;s no real threat here offered by
the villains, led by Umbrella head honcho Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts)
that he looked quite the typical egomaniac who can&#x27;t just pull the
trigger fast enough to get rid of his enemies. Other than that, the
finale fight involves two CG rabid dogs that seriously, nobody will
think will pose a threat to Alice, even in her vulnerable state. Plot
loopholes are plentiful, but don&#x27;t expect the CG effects to compensate
for that. As already mentioned, the 3D here is nothing to shout about.<br /><br />I was a tad disappointed as well with the fight scenes, which seem more
like a rehash of what&#x27;s on offer from the earlier films, with only
Claire/Alice&#x27;s battle with the Axeman (Ray Olubowale) the only fight
sequence something worth mentioning. Otherwise for those who are still
keen to sit through the end credits, you&#x27;ll get a coda involving Jill
Valentine (Sienna Guillory) that will only make sense to fans out
there, who will celebrate in knowing that the 3D ticket sales had
boosted numbers enough for another Resident Evil film to be added to
the franchise.
