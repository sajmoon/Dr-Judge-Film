I got a chance to see this movie at a midnight show on opening day in
IMAX. The movie look and sounded amazing in Imax. The enormous theater
was sold out and many people had to go watch in a non Imax 3d screening
playing next door. When the movie started there was a huge applaud and
the excitement was felt everywhere. However, during the movie it felt
like the audience had just fallen asleep. There were no sounds except
at the end when people where whispering stuff like &#x22;what just
happened&#x22;, &#x22;They ruined it&#x22;. Even my girlfriend said she fell asleep
for a short amount of time. <br /><br />Here is the problem. The movie starts and doesn&#x27;t change the pace.
There is no climax, no wow affects, no twists in the story,...just the
starting and no ending. They also made it more confusing by trying too
many different things instead of keeping the story much simpler like
part 1,2and3. This is not a spoiler at all but it seemed to me that
they also tried to copy Matrix a little bit. Yes i know, its impossible
because they are very different films but apparently someone screwed
up. You&#x27;ll know what i am talking about when/if you see it. <br /><br />Its hard to write a review without giving away anything so i hope you
understand why i am being so vague. All in all this is a &#x27;DVD&#x27; movie. I
gave it 2 stars for the good implementation of the IMAX and i strongly
feel that most reviewers who have given high marks to this film is also
for the same reason but the movie &#x27;sucked&#x27;. If you are expecting more
of part 1, 2 and 3 you will not get it.
