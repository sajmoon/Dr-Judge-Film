The use of 3D makes this movie watchable. I am sure fans of the
previous RE films won&#x27;t be disappointed. The zombies look good, there
are big guns, great sound effects, and lots of scenes with people
flying through the air in slow motion. I would recommend watching this
movie if you love a good old fashioned frag fest on screen, but please
do not expect anything more. This is a typical CGI blessed action flick
and in my opinion its better than the 2nd and 3rd RE movies (which
isn&#x27;t saying a lot really). <br /><br />In conclusion - If you never see this movie, you aren&#x27;t missing
anything. I would strongly recommend it for die hard RE fans but for
others, this one is nothing special. <br /><br />P.S. If you managed to sit through the entire movie, maybe you should
stick around a little longer till the end of the credits. Its worth it.
