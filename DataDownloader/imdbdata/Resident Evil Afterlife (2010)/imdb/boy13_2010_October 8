The movie turned out to be complete disappointment. It just seems like
trying to cash the last drops by making sequels of popular series. The
biggest loophole is the lack of clear plot. The movie is extremely slow
in the beginning and is barely watchable. However it pics up some speed
in later half. But it has the same old action scenes without any
purpose or any flow if storyline. Mila too fails to deliver an
effective performance. She seems to be in hurry to complete the movie
and move to the next story. Also, her kick ass scenes are becoming
boring and repetitive. People who has watched the previous parts would
be disappointed with action scenes. And the new audience would be
confused as to what is happening. Overall the movie does not even
represent typical zombie flick. And made me feel waste of my time.
