The Pitch: It&#x27;s Not A Wonderful Afterlife. (Just setting my stall out
early.) The Review: It&#x27;s one of the most commonly held theories in
movies that you can&#x27;t make good cinematic adaptations of computer
games. Don&#x27;t believe me? Then look at this list. Not one live action
movie based on a computer game has a Rotten Tomatoes score of over 40%,
and the box office for that list is also generally pretty poor. But
surely any movie based on a computer game that&#x27;s managed to get to its
third sequel, and has done big box office business quickly enough to
ensure that the fourth sequel is already on its way, must be doing
something right? Right? If it is, then it&#x27;s gone over my head. There&#x27;s
an obvious appeal from Resident Evil: the series of computer games &#x96;
zombies and other mutated creatures, and you get to dispatch them in
various satisfying ways. The games themselves have always succeeded in
creating atmosphere, but there&#x27;s precious little of that on offer here.
An opening sequence wraps up the cliffhanger from the previous entry,
doing so with precious little in the way of wit, imagination or style.
It does then kickstart the real plot, prompting Milla Jovovich to have
to act briefly in a confession to camera sequence that manages to be
both tedious (it&#x27;s very short but doesn&#x27;t feel it) and unbelievable.<br /><br />Ah yes, Milla Jovovich. Just because you&#x27;re married to the director,
love, does it really mean you have to keep doing these? You&#x27;ve got a
movie coming out with Edward Norton and Robert De Niro soon! Jovovich
continues to fill the function of acting as your avatar in the movie
world but adds very little else in the way of proceedings to anything.
Those missing Ali Larter or Wentworth Miller from their canceled TV
series might think they&#x27;ll get a fix here, but other than the fact
they&#x27;re actually playing characters from the computer games (unlike
most of the others here), they&#x27;re not adding much either.<br /><br />Paul WS Anderson is content to reference other action movies without
ever coming up with anything especially original. Shots are poorly
framed and have no weight in the action sequences, characters are
picked off in uninteresting and undramatic ways (at least throw in a
bit of gore if people we don&#x27;t care about because of your poor plot and
character exposition are dying?), and for a movie that should be full
of zombies, this goes to great lengths to keep them fenced off and
leave you purely in the company of the other insipid excuses for
characters, which is completely inexcusable. The games themselves are
renowned for their puzzles &#x96; the only puzzle here is why you&#x27;d want to
watch it in the first place? * Why see it at the cinema: If you&#x27;re a
fan of the series, then seek help you&#x27;ll be going anyway. If you&#x27;re
not, then you won&#x27;t be going anyway &#x96; hopefully. Frankly, if you&#x27;ve
read this, if you haven&#x27;t been to one of these before and are still
tempted, then I&#x27;d be checking that pulse &#x96; the zombies might have
gotten you already.<br /><br />Why see it in 3D: Nominally, because this is filmed with the same 3D
camera set-up used for Avatar, so the 3D isn&#x27;t applied in
post-production. The effect they have achieved is not only that the 3D
looks dark, but in some places it actually appears the movie is in
black and white. Still, things will occasionally be thrown in your
virtual face, if you like that sort of thing.<br /><br />The Score: 2/10 * You may indeed be wondering why I watched it in the
first place? Foolishly, I had eight hours while my wife was out on a
volunteer assignment and I could fit in three movies, Cyrus and &#x27;Tamara
Drewe&#x27; being the first two, and this then being the only realistic
possibility for a third. On reflection, sitting in the car for two
hours staring at a hedge may have been preferable. Hey, it&#x27;s not the
worst movie I&#x27;ve seen this year, just the second worst. Thanks,
Catherine Zeta Jones.
