I have watched movie yesterday, and I am really disappointed. Like a
real fan on Resident Evil, I expected much more, especially because,
the director of the first Resident Evil (which is in my opinion the
best of all sequels) was back to direct this one. First things first,
this movie isn&#x27;t a horror really, there is no mystery or scary scenes.
This is more like an action movie, than a horror. A lots of scenes
looks like they just come out of Rambo, Matrix or some other action
movie. Story and plot are not interesting and exciting, in other words,
there isn&#x27;t any. Scenery is also static, it looks too much futuristic.
In previous sequels, scenery was changing during whole movie, but in
this one, there are maybe 3 dominant sceneries. Unfortunately, all my
fears of this becoming an action instead of zombie horror are true.
Special effects and 3D scenes are nothing special, but whole movie is
based on them. This crew could have perform much better, if there only
was a good story and plot. Resident Evil atmosphere is just missing
out, even that great music theme from the beginning of the previous
sequels is no more. If you miss this movie, you won&#x27;t be missing much,
I am sorry to say that, but that&#x27;s just it.
