After destroying the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s Headquarter in Tokyo, Alice
(Milla Jovovich) heads to Arcadia, in Alaska, seeking for survivors and
following the broadcasted message that offers security, safety,
shelter, food and no epidemics. However, the place has no one but
Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) that wears a strange device on her chest
and has no recollections. Alice withdraws the electronic device and
flies with Claire to Los Angeles, where she sees a group of survivors
on the roof of a prison asking for help and under siege of the undead.
They land on the roof and they learn with their leader Luther West
(Boris Kodjoe) that Arcadia is actually a ship anchored nearby the
harbor that has stopped broadcasting the message a couple of days
before. Alice and Claire team up with the survivors and they decide to
move to the vessel since the crowd of zombies is menacing their
fortress. But first they release Claire&#x27;s brother Chris Redfield
(Wentworth Miller) that is imprisoned in a cell. But in their journey
to Arcadia, they have to fight against the legion of undead and also
against a treacherous survivor.<br /><br />&#x22;Resident Evil: Afterlife&#x22; is a pleasant full of action adventure, with
two lovely heroines performed by Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter and a
cool good guy, Wentworth Miller, in his first feature after &#x22;Prison
Break&#x22;. Despite the gross continuity mistake when Alice is ready to
take a bath and depending on the angle, the shower is spraying water or
not, the film is highly entertaining and supported by a good story and
great special effects. My vote is six.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &#x22;Resident Evil 4: Recome&#xE7;o&#x22; (&#x22;Resident Evil: Restart&#x22;)
