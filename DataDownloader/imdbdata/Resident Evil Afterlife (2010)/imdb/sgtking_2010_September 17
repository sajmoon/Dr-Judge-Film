By number 4 a series often is past it&#x27;s prime and it&#x27;s time to throw in
the towel. It seems like they&#x27;re just not trying anymore and the
driving force is a big fat paycheck. 3-D has made a huge comeback as of
late and it looks like it won&#x27;t be going anywhere anytime soon. When a
sequel uses the gimmick it does make one wonder if it&#x27;s being done
simply to put butts in the seats or if it&#x27;s to enhance an already good
movie-going experience. People are divided on the &#x27;Resident Evil&#x27;
films, some love them and others despise them. The first sequel really
got blasted and the previous one, &#x27;Extinction,&#x27; was treated a little
more kindly. So here we are at the fourth installment and it&#x27;s in 3-D.
Some will undoubtedly leave the theatre wanting their money back, but
personally I was pretty darn happy when it was over.<br /><br />Pros: Solid performances all around, especially from Milla Jovovich and
Wenthworth Miller. Paul W.S. Anderson returned to the directors chair
for this outing and it&#x27;s a good thing he did because he handles it
beautifully. An adrenaline pumping score that&#x27;s even a bit haunting at
times. Amazing special and visual effects. Awesome production design.
Moves at a good pace that is at times slow and others effortless. A few
memorable and exciting action sequences. A bit of humor added to the
mix, mostly due to the great Kim Coates.<br /><br />Cons: Virtually no plot. Some disposable characters. Once again things
are lifted from other movies.<br /><br />Final thoughts: There is still much life left in this series and it
looks like it&#x27;s not over yet. It is a case of more style than
substance, but is one of those cases where that works. The world does
need films like this where you can just kick back and enjoy the ride. A
series that hasn&#x27;t gotten tired just yet.<br /><br />My rating: 4/5
