Camera work and costumes are beautiful (love Alice&#x27;s totally hip G.I.
Jane ensembles so much!) as well as the very talented casts&#x27;
performances. St. John the Beloved has seen such an incredible array of
filmmakers&#x27; creative takes on the book of Revelation that I am almost
tired of watching them (not really!), and the RE: franchise is holding
that favorite spot along with The Chronicles of Riddick. That whole
Noah&#x27;s Ark/ RED Target theme is, for the most part, a little obscure
for most people to fully appreciate right now. Nevertheless...A poor
man&#x27;s Angelina Jolie is a pretty petty attempt at insulting both
stunning and intelligent women.<br /><br />Those that don&#x27;t like it, AIN&#x27;T READY FOR IT yet! A very enthusiastic 4
thumbs up.
