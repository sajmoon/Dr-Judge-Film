I&#x27;m a huge fan of Milla Jovovich and the Resident Evil movies. The last
one - &#x22;Resident Evil: Extinction&#x22; - I thought was a great movie and the
best in the series so far.<br /><br />So I had to see this latest installment, what a disappointing and
mediocre movie it turned out to be. The 3D was so fuzzy and distracting
throughout the film but even if it hadn&#x27;t been in fuzzy 3D it still was
badly directed and poorly written, with hardly any of the signature
action scenes, and all the actors were very pitiable and amateurish,
with an exceptionally lame lead villain. Most of the action was blah
and boring, in routine slow mo cuts. Don&#x27;t go to see this movie if you
want good or creative action scenes or an interesting story.<br /><br />Most of the actors made no impression whatsoever, with the exception of
Milla and Wentworth Miller of &#x22;Prison Break&#x22; fame. And even Wentworth
Miller was given little to do, he didn&#x27;t have but a handful of lines in
the movie and it was a waste of his considerable talent. I really hope
that he does better movies and roles in the future. I think he could
become a major movie star, but not with appearing in crappy movies like
this.<br /><br />I am giving it a generous 5 rating, and that is from a fans
perspective. If I wasn&#x27;t a fan I would give this movie a 3.<br /><br />Please let the next Resident Evil have a different director than this
sub par effort had, and please let it not be in horrifying 3D.
