A terrible movie... There was no storyline, and not enough Zombie
fighting to cover for it. Usually when making Zombie Movies, its either
a good plot or lots of zombie killing, the plot was boring and there
was only one good zombie fight. It seems as if the writers of this
movie thought they could make another mediocre movie using the 3D
experience and plenty of effects, they used too much slow motion if you
ask me. <br /><br />And about the 3D experience I have no Idea how they make it... if it is
a different technology in every film or whatever... But the feeling of
Depth was not as good as Avatar, or Alice.<br /><br />I really hope they stop at this movie and not make another sequel
