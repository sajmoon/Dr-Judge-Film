First, i cant understand all the people complaining that this movie is
too dumb, not enough plot, flat characters... You all went to an
Resident Evil MOVIE. What did i expect: - Sexy Mila - Hot chicks -
Zombies - Postapocalyptiv world - Other T Virus infected creatures - to
see how that zombies/creatures get kicked ass by hot chicks and their
friends - Gore/Splatter - the evil company with the name umbrella -
entertaining action scenes with cool soundtrack. Those were my
expectations. Resident Evil After Life - Mission Accomplished! I love
this movie, because it is what it has to be, it does what it has to do
and its showing that in great pictures with a very cool soundtrack.
AWESOME!
