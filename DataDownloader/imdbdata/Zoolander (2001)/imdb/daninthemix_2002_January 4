Or more specifically - a comedy with many, many more unsuccessful jokes than
ones that make you momentarily lose control of your motor and bowel
functions.<br /><br />Whilst I admit I chuckled briefly at the gag about anorexia, I don't recall
ever being amused other than that (oh, and this man in the theatre who
clearly was amused, and had the funniest laugh I've ever heard - but anyway,
I digress), I fail to see the point in making a film whose sole purpose is
to induce hilarity, and summarily fail to do so.<br /><br />1/10
