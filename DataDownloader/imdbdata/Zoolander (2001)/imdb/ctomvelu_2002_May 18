This is a movie one wants to like, because it is a Ben Stiller movie. And it
has some funny moments. But it is essentially a 3-minute SNL skit stretched
into a 90-minute clunker. It is not as good as BIO-DOME or AUSTIN POWERS,
movies it vaguley resembles. The plot is lifted from THE MANCHURIAN
CANDIDATE, of all things! Dumb fun for anyone under 13, pretty much
excruciating for anyone over 13. Lots of cameos, but poor use of most of
them. I swear I spotted Vince Vaughan in one sequence, and he had absolutely
no dialogue!
