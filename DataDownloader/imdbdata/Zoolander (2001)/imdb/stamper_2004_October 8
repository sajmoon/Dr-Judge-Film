Occasions have been rare when I've seen so many actors trying so hard,
to act as badly as they could in order to be funny. I mean with Ben
Stiller it usually is nothing ordinary when he acts badly, but even he
'outperforms' himself on this one. I mean usually he's pretty bad, but
in this one you wonder if his skill to act so badly isn't actually some
form of acting skill!!! Granted, there are some cheese parts in here
and there are lots of scenes where you think: 'That's just not funny
guys.' but it is because everybody who's in this doesn't seem to take
any of it seriously, the viewer doesn't either. This in fact helps the
film and keeps it from being complete crap and instead turning it into
a pretty passable flick.<br /><br />6 out of 10
