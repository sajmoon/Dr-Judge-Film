come on! yes, the movie was goofy. yes, the movie was dumb. and yes, the
movie was dumb AND stupid - but thats the whole point. to everyone who
says
that they hated this movie, i wonder if they have any sense of humor at
all.
maybe instead of harboring this strange resentment against the ridiculous
jokes and names and acting, everyone should lighten up. zoolander is not
an
intellectual comedy, but it was never advertised as such. from the the
start
the ad campaign was basically &quot;this movie = dumb.&quot;
will ferrell was awesome. i understand that not everyone is a will ferrell
fan, but mugatu is the most extraordinarily funny character in a long
time.
and ben stiller did a good job, too. you knew he'd be a dumb model and he
did that well, while also adding a distinctly ben stiller something to the
role. and jerry stiller! granted, he was similar to his seinfeld role, but
without him the movie would not have been as whole. the character of
katinka
was somewhat unnecessary, but you can't always get what you want, as mick
once sang.
the point is, if you just stop waiting to be impressed by some artsy,
intellectual comedic think-piece, and stop hating the world for an hour
and
a half, this movie rules. &quot;now that's what i'm talkin about!&quot;
