This movie seems to try a little too hard to be funny, trying to go
overboard on every joke it puts in, and the jokes comes every time they get
a chance to throw one at you.  On many, it works, but not on some others. 
It is like a campy B-movie, but instead of under-writing and under-playing,
it goes the other way, with the jokes outlandish and the acting so over the
top.  In some ways, it is like a long Saturday Night Live skit, where you
try to get the maximum impact in the alloted time, but this goes on for much
longer than a few minutes, although it does not fail in the way of some of
the SNL spinoffs.<br /><br />But taken for what it is, you would get a good laugh out of
it.
