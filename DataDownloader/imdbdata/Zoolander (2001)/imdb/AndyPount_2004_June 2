This film contains a lot of different comedy that would make some
people laugh and some not, u either think this film is funny or u do
not there is no middle. the funniest moment in my opinion is when the
fashion awards is taking place and a video comes on for both hansel and
derek and hansels 'i wasn't like every otha kid that dreamed about
being an astronaut i was more interested about what kinda bark was made
out of on a tree' stupid quote but somehow Owen Wilson makes it sound
funny and there are many occasions in the film when this type of comedy
happens. Also Will Ferell as Mugatu steals the show with the best
comedy performance by him in a while and his stupid haircut.<br /><br />I do not think this film was better than Meet the Parents or the Cable
guy that Stiller directed but it does have its moments 7/10 see this if
you liked Meet the Parents, Cable guy (any other Ben Stiller film) cya
