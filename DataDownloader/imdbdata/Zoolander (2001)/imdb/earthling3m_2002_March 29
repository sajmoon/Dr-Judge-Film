Ben Stiller can be very funny, and has a natural flair for comedy, both in
terms of acting and directing, but this attempt at spoofing the fashion
industry doesn't achieve the level of irony and humour it could have. The
main weakness? The script could have been richer and, well, much funnier.<br /><br /> In 'Derek Zoolander', Stiller creates a loveably dumb character, a top male
model who is all beauty and no brains. But it works out as little more than
a one-joke movie, and even that one joke (that models are dumb) is stretched
too thin to be really funny. Mike Myers did the whole male
vanity-cum-dumbness routine much more richly with Austin Powers.<br /><br /> Having said all that, however, the movie is almost worth watching for the
plot device in the climax alone.<br /><br /> OK, so it's Stiller, and thus watchable, but with all that talent there (I
mean, even Stiller's dad is played by Jon Voight), it could have been much
better. Owen Wilson is good, though, as the blonde supermodel Hansel, and
the movie is an amiable way to pass an evening. But it isn't Stiller's best
work.
