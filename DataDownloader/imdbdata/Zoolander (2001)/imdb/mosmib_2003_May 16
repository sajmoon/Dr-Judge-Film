Zoolander is an absurd movie and for that reason alone I recommend it.
The
one-liners in the film are the best.    Mugatu (Will Ferrell's character)
is
one to keep an eye on throughout the film.  Everything he says will make
you
say &quot;What?&quot;  Do yourself a favor, if you want to laugh check out this
movie.
