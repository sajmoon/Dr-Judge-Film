I was dragged into the theater to see this movie thinking it would be
absolutely horrible based on the commericals advertising it.  I was VERY
pleasantly suprised.  This movie was by far the funniest movie I have seen
in such a long time.  It is now on my list of all time favorite movies.
The
cast is amazing.  Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, just to name a few, have such
an
awesome chemistry together.  It makes fun of making fun of male modeling,
you have to have a good sense of humor to enjoy this movie.  It is one of
those movies you can watch over and over and never get tired of watching.
