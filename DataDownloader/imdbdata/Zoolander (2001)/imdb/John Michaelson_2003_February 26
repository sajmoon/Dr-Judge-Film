I think every once in awhile we need a silly moment. Nothing deep, no
explanations. And Zoolander is where it is.<br /><br />But watching closer (should you decide to think about it or delve deep into
the film)then you will se an excellently crafted movie. Excellent in most
aspects from the writing, directing, cinematography and
soundtrack.<br /><br />Costuming was perfectly crafted as well.<br /><br />And it has it's very classic moments (Hansel and Derek trying to turn on the
Apple Computer is one moment and what 'walk-off' scene).<br /><br />Christine Taylor has gone far since her Marcia Brady days and Owen Wilson
shows his versatility as a n actor (especially since his &quot;The Haunting&quot;
days).<br /><br />Ben Stiller is as sharp as ever and stays well into his character without
any discrepancies. (I was also amused to see him face to face with his
father - and did you catch Ben's mother's cameo?)<br /><br />So where does the film go? Nowhere. Again I warn you this is not a
thinking-one's film. No need to try and make sense of it and certainly not
the classic's classic film, but yet a comedy cult classic that will be
viewed in the future as a comedic &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; with it's sharp
imagery, off-the-wall scenes and perfect timing.<br /><br />If Stanley Kubrick was a comedic film maker, this would be the
result.
