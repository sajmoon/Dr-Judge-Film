2002_February 27 

When i decided to go and see this movie i was very sceptical to whether this
was actually the movie for me or not and in the end im very glad i chose
&quot;yes&quot;. Although it was mainly the stupidity of zoolander and his model
friends that made me enjoy the movie, i still think the movie on a whole was
very good. Derek Zoolander, the dumb, young model with a wide range of
looks, is played by the one and only Ben Stiller, Hansel, the rival of young
Zoolander, is played by Owen Wilson and the Fearless Jacobim Mugatu is
played by the wonderful actor Will Ferrell. This fabulous array of actors is
just a few of the marvelous actors that take a role in this comedy
exstravagansa and i think they are enough to encourage anybody to see this
film. The plot itself is quite origional and easy to follow and of course
very funny too. One particular scene that humoured me was the one were
zoolander was hypnotised by a dancing Mugatu, but i wont spoil it too much
for you. So make sure you see this film, like it and make other people see
it too. I shall give it a 7 out of 10 as zoolanders stupidity was just too
stupid for me at some points.
