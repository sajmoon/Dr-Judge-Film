2006_September 9 
To be honest, the main reason I rented this movie was that people quote
it all the time, and I never understand what they&#39;re referring to (and
usually, oft-quoted movies are very entertaining, such as Anchorman or
Tommy Boy). Now having seen it, I still don&#39;t know why people quote
this movie. I rented the movie knowing full well that I have never
liked Ben Stiller in any movie I&#39;ve seen him in. This movie was
completely laugh-less for me, except for one part I can&#39;t quite recall
(might&#39;ve been the part where Zoolander and Hansel were trying to use
the computer).<br /><br />The only bright point for this movie was the cast (except for Stiller
and Wilson). I thought making Jerry Stiller Zoolander&#39;s agent was a
great choice, and the tons of celebrity cameos I felt were wasted on
such a bad movie (Paris Hilton, Natalie Portman, Fred Durst, Lance
Bass, and ESPECIALLY David Bowie). In fact, 2 of the three stars I&#39;m
giving it are for all the cameos, because I love me some cameos.<br /><br />All in all, a terribly disappointing movie.
