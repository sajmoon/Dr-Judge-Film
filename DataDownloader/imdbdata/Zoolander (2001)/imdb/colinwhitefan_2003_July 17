Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), an intellectually challenged but bone
structure blessed male model who's despondent after being eclipsed in
popularity by an equally vacuous rival, Hansel (Owen Wilson). Upon his
reluctant retirement, Derek is invited to a day spa by previously
standoffish fashion designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell), where the
befuddled model is brainwashed by the mysterious Katinka (Milla Jovovich)
into assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia. In addition to Stiller's
real life (and very hot) wife Christine Taylor, Zoolander also co stars his
dad Jerry Stiller, with Jon Voight, David Duchovny, Andy Dick, and Fabio
among others. I found Zoolander dumb yet hilarious, the dumb jokes actually
made me laugh. I admit one of the main reasons I watched this movie is
because of Ben's wife Christine Taylor and she is one of my favorites and is
looking very good in this goofy film.
