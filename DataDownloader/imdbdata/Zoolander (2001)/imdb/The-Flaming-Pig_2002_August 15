     This has got to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. Not the
Stupid, Bad/Boring Type Movie. Like, Stupid/Brainless/idiotic Movie. But, in
other words, IT IS VERY, VERY GOOD. &quot;Derek Zoolander&quot; (Ben Stiller) is just
the dumbest person in the universe (And perhaps one of the funniest). The
Scene with the &quot;Derek Zoolander school for kids who can't read good&quot;. I
laughed till it hurt. And the &quot;Walkoff&quot;: PURE GENIUS!!!! Go Rent the Movie
Right Now...No, Don't Rent it... BUY IT!!! BUY IT FOR ALL YOUR FRIENDS  FOR
THEIR BIRTHDAYS, AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT OR ALREADY HAVE IT, JUST BUY
ANOTHER COPY FOR THEM NEXT YEAR!!!! HAHAHAHA!!
       My rating: 9/10
