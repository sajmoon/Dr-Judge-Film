In about 1997 a new genre was invented with the coming of `Austin Powers'.
While it was a spoof of such, it wouldn't be considered in the same vein as
the ZAZ/ Mel Brooks movies. And after hits like `Scary Movie' and flops like
`Scary Movie 2', the latest in line is `Zoolander'. And this is easily as
funny, if not funnier, than the second two `Austin Powers' movies. Written,
directed and headlined by Ben Stiller, this was quite a hat trick to pull
off. But the job was done and a good job at that. At the same time, this is
hardly groundbreaking material. And in retrospect it's only laughing gas.<br /><br />From some perspectives this is a satire on the style-crazy fashion industry
in the same light as `Pret-a-Porter'. But the film is too stupid and
inaccurate to be truly realistic, so this is best thought as a just-for-fun
barrel of gags. As is the usual case, when the jokes hit they can be
hilarious. But when they miss, they leave you staring blankly at the screen.
And it does get a little carried with itself towards the end as it becomes
to hip and trendy for all tastes. A slightly limp third act is well
compensated for by hilarious proceedings. The central plot of the attempted
assassination of the Prime Minister of Malaysia is a mere skeleton for the
plot to stick to, and hardly the strongest point. But again, this isn't to
be taken seriously. <br /><br />The character of Derek Zoolander represents the vapid male model of today
and is hilariously portrayed by Ben Stiller. In most of his other comedies
(`Meet the Parents', `There's something about Mary') he played the
protagonist who is the subject of the jokes, and it's great to finally see
him as the antagonist as he has a good flair for comedy. Particularly funny
is his part as a merman in the informecial for water. As the over-flamboyant
opposition, Owen Wilson has rarely been funnier. Will Ferrell's obnoxious
fashion designer Mugatu is a half-realised character. He starts out funny
but towards the end becomes increasingly annoying. The rest of the support
is decent all round from Christine Taylor, Milla Jovovich, John Voight and
David Duchovny among others including a host of celebrity cameos.<br /><br />The real star is the script that holds many memorable one-liners. And while
many of the lines are delivered with impeccable gusto, others just fall
flat. A good example is the classic `You can't think for yourself' `You're
right, I can't' line. It isn't bad, but it's been used many times before and
seems a little slack when attempted here. While it is shapeless, absurd and
just as shallow as the subject matter itself, `Zoolander' is also one of the
funniest movies around at the moment. If you want a good `stupid' comedy
`Zoolander' is a passive and entertaining bit of gas. Just don't expect
anything else. My IMDb rating: 6.4/10.
