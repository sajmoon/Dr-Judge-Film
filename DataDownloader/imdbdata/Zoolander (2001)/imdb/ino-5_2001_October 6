Ever have someone tell you the same joke?  They change details,
but
it is the same joke.  That is the movie, &quot;Zoolander.&quot;  Great plot
idea.
A male model, is brainwashed into killing a prime minister.  Now
add
an international conspiracy behind it.  Now make the international
conspiracy responsible for every assassination plot for the
past
100+ years.  Make the male model vain and vapid.  Now give him vain and
vapid male model friends.  Now make his arch-rival a male model. 
Better
yet, make him vain and vapid also!  
I saw this show in a theatre with an audience of four.  Two
walked
out of the show after 50 minutes.  They missed nothing.
