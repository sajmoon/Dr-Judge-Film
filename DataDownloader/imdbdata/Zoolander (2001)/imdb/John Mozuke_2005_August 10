I didn't find Ben Stiller to be very funny in this movie. What saved it
for me was Will Ferrell and Owen Wilsons HAAAAAAAAAAAAnsel. Wilson is
hilarious. Ferrell is over the top and his comic timing is perfect.
Stiller seems to be trying too hard and even though Derek Zoolander is
suppose to be as thick as a brick in his skull it gets old real fast.
Wilson steals every scene. Milla Jovovichs Betty Page hair, big red
lips, dominatrix gear with a Natasha ( of Boris and Natasha stupid
squirrel fame) is great. Jovovich is hilarious and plays her part to
the hilt. Lots of cameos by the rich and the famous. I like the concept
but I would say check out this flick but its not for everybody.
