This movie is &quot;ok&quot;, fun, an amusement. Though it does contain a couple
of brilliant jokes (i.e. &quot;Male Models having &quot;Fun&quot; at the Gas Station),
basically the movie is aims very low. There are many idiotic childish
jokes, which makes you feel sometimes uncomfortable, or may cause you
regrets for buying the ticket/renting the DVD. But since it is a
parody, we have to accept that level. Ben Stiller is a great comedian,
but in my opinion he is much more funny as a loser type, rather than
the &quot;idiot&quot; type he plays in most of his movies. That is why &quot;Meet the
Parents&quot; and &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; are funnier more
intelligent films than &quot;Zoolander&quot; or &quot;Dodge Ball&quot;.
