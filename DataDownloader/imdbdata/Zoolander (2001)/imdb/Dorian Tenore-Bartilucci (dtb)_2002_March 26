In Entertainment Weekly, Ben Stiller described this feature-length
adventure
of the moronic male model he created for the VH1 Fashion Awards as
&quot;MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE meets EYES OF LAURA MARS.&quot; Me, I can sum it up in
two
words:  &quot;AUSTIN Posers.&quot;  No, better yet, I'll boil it down to one word:
&quot;endearing.&quot;  That's right, endearing!  As lighthearted as it is
lightheaded, this daffy spoof of conspiracy thrillers and the mad, mod
world
of male models and other hipsters has a surprising undercurrent of
sweetness
to it. Star/director/co-writer/co-producer Stiller plays dopey Derek
Zoolander as a gentle, essentially kind-hearted naif under his hip veneer.
The same is true of Owen Wilson, putting his twang and quirky humor to
good
use as Derek's rustic yet hippy-dippy rival-turned-ally Hansel. I suspect
folks will like ZOOLANDER even better on DVD, since there are tons of
hilarious extended scenes and deleted scenes as well as the original
Zoolander TV sketches that Stiller &amp; Co. did for VH1. As Derek says in the
voiceover intros on the DVD menu, the ZOOLANDER disc is a wonderful
introduction to &quot;the world of DiviDuh&quot;! :-)<br /><br />
