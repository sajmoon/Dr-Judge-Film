Derek (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson) are the worlds greatest
two models. And nobody in the world could play them quite like Stiller
and Wilson. Stiller was also a writer and the director of Zoolander and
knows how to put together a movie. <br /><br />While the movie often focuses on Derek and Hansel out modelling each
other, I believe the real contest was off screen being played out on
screen between the two. This being who could play the more sarcastic
and larger than life model. Stiller may win this, but the sheer
arrogance of Wilson&#39;s on screen demeanor tips the scale in his favour
for me. When the two work together they are up there with the great
duo&#39;s of comedy.<br /><br />This is far from Stiller&#39;s best work however, moving along a little too
slowly at times. Having said this it is still well worth a look and
should give you plenty of laughs providing you appreciate the Stiller
Wilson combo.
