Watch this movie: it's Ben Stiller! In this movie we can find Stiller
as an actor and the director, his father (Jerry Stiller) and his wife
(Christine Taylor), so here there's all his life, as a man and as an
actor. The collaboration with Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell, that we can
find also in &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, is unbelievable! Comicity, irony, gags
are the essence of this movie, based on the life of a model at the end
of his career, Derek Zoolander, that has been recruit, after a
brainwash, to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. The incredible
number of stars that participate and appears in this movie (Stephen
Diorf, Christian Slater, Milla Jovovich, John Voight, David Bowie,
Billy Zane, Winona Ryder and many others...) makes this movie unique!
