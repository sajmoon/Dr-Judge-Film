Zoolander is the story of the hottest but dumbest male model in the world,
Derek Zoolander (who happens to be living the skinny American Dream of
getting paid vast amounts of money to have his picture taken and become
famous), who grows disillusioned with the modeling industry after he is
suddenly overshadowed by another male model at an awards show, and is then
targeted and effortlessly brainwashed to assassinate the Prime Minister of
Malaysia in order to perpetuate the male modeling industry. Evidently, that
Prime Minister is just too set in his efforts to eradicate child labor in
Malaysia, which would just be an unacceptable blow to the fashion industry,
which relies too much on the efforts of such child labor. The first thing
that strikes me about this plotline is that, with the astronomical amount
of
money that circulates in the fashion industry, most of which goes into the
sickening paychecks of the powerful people involved in that industry, I
would think that they could finally start paying regular prices for the
manufacturing of the clothing that they use in their business.<br /><br />Why is it that the hugest and richest corporations always seem to be the
ones involved in child labor?  One of the great ironies of capitalism (and,
indeed one of the more disturbing ones) is that the more money people have,
the less they want to spend. So we get these dirt-poor kids in foreign
countries who spend long days in sweatshops making these products for next
to nothing, and then the products are shipped here where they're modeled
and
then sold at astronomical prices.<br /><br />Besides that, I was truly shocked that they portrayed the Prime Minister of
Malaysia, who is a real person, as the &quot;antagonist&quot; who wants to eradicate
child labor laws, and they make him the target of this ludicrous
assassination. As Roger Ebert mentioned, did NOBODY involved with the movie
think that maybe that was in bad taste? I'm sure that nobody who was
involved in the overlooking of this massive point meant any harm by this,
but Derek Zoolander also meant no harm in being brainwashed, but that
doesn't make him very intelligent. It seems strange that the film is
structured entirely around this plot to have Derek Zoolander assassinate
the
Prime Minister, and yet the comedy in the film comes entirely from his tiny
intellect. The fact that we laugh at the hilarious extent of Derek's
stupidity and the similar allusion to an alleged lack of cognitive activity
in the fashion industry as a whole (`Derek, me help you did!'), and not
Derek's working over by Mugatu, the real antagonist in the film, completely
eliminates the need for any subplot, especially one that involves a plot to
murder a real and highly respected world leader.<br /><br />While I was overall less than impressed by the film, I can't say that I
didn't just about lose consciousness laughing so hard at Zoolander's
response when J.P. Prewitt (David Duchovny) told him that Mugatu will most
likely use some kind of auditory or visual Pavlovian response mechanism to
get him to kill the Prime Minister (`An after party?'), and then again at
Prewitt's response after having been shot when Zoolander takes off on his
mission and steps on his glass-encased hand (`AAAHHHhhh you freakin'
idiot!'). THAT was some great stuff, and there are at least three or four
other moments of quality laughs, but it's just too bad that there was so
much tasteless content in the movie, especially since it went far beyond
the
childish and disgusting humor that usually plagues bad comedies these days
(American Pie, the Scary Movies, Road Trip, Sorority Boys, etc.). Watch the
movie for the great interactions between Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, but
be
advised that there is some truly tasteless and often offensive content in
the movie, and it can't all be dismissed just by acknowledging the fact
that
it's just some goofball comedy.
