First, this is a stupid movie. The plot is far-fetched and things work like
magic but who cares this movie is not pretentious it has a stupid plot about
a stupid male model. Ben Stiller is absolutely hilarious in the lead role.
His writing and directing in this movie were also stellar the whole cast
leaves you laughing. It's not something you'll gain insight to the mysteries
of the universe from but you will laugh and have a good
time.
