Released a few short weeks after Sept. 11, Zoolander became the target of
&quot;this is why they hate us&quot; diatribes. I didn't see it until months later
and
immediately recognized what I can only hope I would have seen if I had
watched it earlier--that this is a superb satire/farce.  There aren't many
movies that manage to be both silly and smart at the same time, and this
is
one. It is not only a send-up of the modeling and fashion industries,
admittedly easy targets, but of our whole image-obsessed culture which
commodifies love, spirituality, patriotism, heroism just as easily and
unthinkingly as it does kitchen appliances. This is not a &quot;stupid&quot; movie,
even though it is about stupid people and stupid situations. It keeps the
targets of its satire within its sights at every moment, never letting
that
focus flag to pursue maudlin subplots, but at the same time, it is
unfailingly hilarious, with marvelous comic acting, sight-gags, sets, and
costumes. The screen is just packed with visual jokes at almost every
moment. This is not a movie that anyone needs to be embarrassed to watch
or
enjoy. But it is also just plain damned fun!
