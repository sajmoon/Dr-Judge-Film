A film that gives a wonderful insight into the fascinating world of
male modelling. <br /><br />Haha. Ahahahaha. <br /><br />This film is flippin&#x27; hilarious. Derek Zoolander is one of those
characters whose one-liners and brilliant facial expressions will be
imitated for years and years to come. It&#x27;s an excellent film for people
with a bizarre and surreal sense of humour, but normal people would
definitely get some sort of satisfaction out of it too. <br /><br />Basically, if you liked &#x27;Anchorman&#x27;, you&#x27;ll like this. It&#x27;s in the same
ball park. <br /><br />I&#x27;ve got so much respect for Ben Stiller now.
