Dumb comedies, are proving to produce quite some cluttered genre. Some,
like Dumb And Dumber, hit the mark. Others, such as Dude, Where's My
Car?, miss by a mile. Ben Stiller's pet project falls somewhere between
the two. That said, the performances from the billed leads are very
good. Stiller is effectively amusing as the self-obsessed Derek. Owen
Wilson is absolutely outstanding as scooter-sporting stoner Hansel in a
role that was written specifically for him. Sure, he's playing a
version of himself and you'll probably have seen him do a very similar
turn in Shanghai Noon. Milla Jovovich is woefully underused as the Rosa
Klebb-like Hench-woman but the epitome of unfunny badness here is Will
Ferrell. With an villain that somehow crosses Diamonds Are Forever's
gay hit-man Mr Kint with Dr Evil.<br /><br />Okay, so it's not the most sophisticated or consistently funny film
you're likely to see but Zoolander will tickle your ribs on many
occasions and as one man shows go, it's all to Ben Stiller's credit
after the mauling he received for Cable Guy. If you like &quot;A night at
the Roxbury&quot; &quot;Dodgeball&quot; and &quot;Old School&quot; than you will like this.
