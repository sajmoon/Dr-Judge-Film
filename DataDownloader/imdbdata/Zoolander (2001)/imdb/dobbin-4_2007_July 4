Zoolander is the type of movie that you dream of seeing it has
everything a comedy need to has and it is so damn funny! I mean I must
have laughed around 35 times during the movie and Owen Wilson and Ben
Stiller just raise that bar of comedy in this one. They were good in
other movies, but this one is by far their absolute best. Now this
movie is about stuck up male model Derek Zoolander(Ben Stiller) who is
a stupid person who&#39;s won the best Male Model award 3 times in a row
before coming second in a run for the fourth by Hansel(Owen Wilson),
another Stupid guy. This movie has got probably the biggest laughs out
of any movie I&#39;ve seen in a long time, so overall I rate this movie 94%
and I recommend that everybody sane watch it.
