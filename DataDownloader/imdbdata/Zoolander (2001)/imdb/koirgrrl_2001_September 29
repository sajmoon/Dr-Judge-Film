I've always been a fan of Ben Stiller, but after seeing this movie, he's
gone all the way up to Jim Carey status. Absolutely hilarious movie. My
sides actually hurt after seeing it. Will Ferrel couldn't have been funnier
and Mila Jovioich(sp) couldn't have looked freakier. Billy Zane's in it too!
YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!
