I agree with user comment Kevdoggy. This movie was hillarious and it's kind
of funny how seriously some people take movies. People are literally saying
they hate this movie. Movies are about escape and this was the perfect
remedy for my low spirits post Sept. 11. My friends and I were all rolling
especially the scene were there's a commercial with Stiller as a merman.
Outrageous! Will Ferrel was disturbing but funny. Christine Taylor was cute
and Wilson does steal the show. But Stiller, I feel is still on a
roll.
