Zoolander isn't really a film it is a bunch of
sketches stitched together, and it shows in both the short
running time and extreme stretching of some jokes. There is a moment
in
the film when you think that it's going to hit its target hard --
child
labour and how the fashion industry exploits it to manufacture incredibly
cheap clothing and then sell at obscene prices -- but then it backs off and
goes for the cheap gags instead. Models are stupid, pampered and vain...
yeah, tell us something we don't know. That's not to say there aren't lots
of funny moments in it (Derek and Hansel faced with getting info out of a
computer is brilliant), but when you add it all up you are left with... not
much.<br /><br />Maybe it is because the world of fashion and modelling is a ripe target for
spoofing? It's just too damned easy to rip on the vacuous and shallow -- and
what's worse, the fashion industry is, by its nature, an attention whore. It
wants you to watch for whatever reason. So any barbs sent their way are just
laughed off and turned into more publicity for them, and the whole thing
just seems to celebrate instead of excoriate. Or maybe that's what Stiller
wanted all along.
