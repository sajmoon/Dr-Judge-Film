Derek Zoolander(Ben Stiller) was once the best of the modeling
industry, but after losing the &quot;Best Model of the Year&quot; award to a
rising model named Hansel(Owen Wilson), his career is winding down.
Noticing Derek's downfall, a huge modeling campaigner Mugatu(Will
Ferrell) puts Derek as the face of his new line of clothes. The only
problem is that every major assassination of the past two centuries has
been initiated by the modeling industry and Derek is brainwashed to be
the assassin in the next murder. With the help of Hansel and a reporter
named Matilda(Christine Taylor), Derek tries to escape the evil scheme
that he is capable of committing.<br /><br />The movie, as you can probably guess, is just hilarious. Ben Stiller is
absolutely fantastic and this is the first appearance of his wife,
Christine Taylor and did a great job also. Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson
just add on the greatness of the movie. Overall, the movie is one of
the funniest movies of the decade.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
