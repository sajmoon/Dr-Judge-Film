When Zoolander came out, I remember big deal plugs that were made for this
film by the media. The movie, after all, is poking fun at entertainment, in
particular, the fashion and model industry.
This was a hilarious take on it, and Zoolander, our main character, is
stupidly lovable. Ben Stiller proves once again his flexibility with his
comedic acting. Just watch 'Meet the Parents'and this, you'll think it's 2
different actors. Showing you how much work Ben can do, he also helped write
and produce the movie. Owen Wilson usually ends up in a movie with Ben, and
he's hilarious too. And of course Will Ferrell is always a
riot.
Read the Plot Outline in the details, there's not much to it. But you don't
watch movies like this for incredible story lines, do you?<br /><br />No, it's not an oscar winning comedy, most aren't. It's not an intelligent
look at real-life, it's not the greatest storyline driven kind of movie, and
it doesn't have top notch acting. But it's incredibly funny, especially the
DVD. The DVD is filled with so many extra goodies, it's worth
getting.
The movie is filled with cameos like David Bowie, Paris Hilton, Billy Zane,
AH! There are so many, you just have to see the list yourself.<br /><br />Rent or buy it, and leave your brain on the table next to the popcorn.
Because there's more to life then being really, really, ridiculously
smart.
