&#x22;Zoolander&#x22; is stupid, but it&#x27;s stupid in every way: its characters,
its plot, and its jokes, but that starts adding up to fun. I will admit
that I laugh most times I watch it, sometimes I groan because of the
stupidity, but I usually have a smile on my face.<br /><br />The plot? Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a washed-up model who has
been brainwashed to kill a foreign Prime Minister. Sound stupid? That&#x27;s
because it&#x27;s supposed to be. We have a handful of male models, all of
them with IQs lower than their body fat percentage, and all of them
getting into situations that they are not mentally equipped for.<br /><br />You can&#x27;t watch &#x22;Zoolander&#x22; for its story or its characters, you can
only watch it for its inane humour. And the fact that these are men
being shown off as models and not women.
