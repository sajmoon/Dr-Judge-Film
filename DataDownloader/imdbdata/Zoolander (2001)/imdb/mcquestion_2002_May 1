Okay, first of all let me qualify this review by saying I hated Stiller's
similar spoof film on comic book characters, Mystery Men, and movies like
Dumb &amp; Dumber. I've also never seen his skits which this movie is based on.
Make no mistake, this movie is stupid. Incredibly stupid. It's so stupid
it's hilarious in my humble opinion. Stiller is hilarious, Owen Wilson is
quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, Ben's dad Jerry and Will Ferrel
show us why they've been scene stealers on TV for years, and Ben's wife is
there mainly to move the storyline along. This movie is no Dumb &amp; Dumber.
It's not all fart jokes and immature humour, this is stupid humour, but it's
a clever spoof on the modelling world that's realllllllly over the top. One
of the funniest moments for me was the scene where Zoolander's model pals
have a &quot;gasoline fight&quot; and accidentally immolate themselves (all to the
horrid Wham tune &quot;Wake me up before you go go&quot;). Nope, this film is not for
those who appreciate Woody Allen type comedy, but if you laugh at something
that is so stupid that it's funny without really gross jokes, than see this
film.<br /><br />PS. Don't worry about the plot. It's truly secondary to the idiocy of the
film.
