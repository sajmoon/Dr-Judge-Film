&quot;Zoolander&quot; slampoons those people we all love to hate...fashion models.
Especially, the male fashion model. Ben Stiller in the company of his
parents and a whole bunch of miscellaneous celebs in bit parts, plays an
empty-headed and narcissistic top male fashion model, Derek Zoolander,  who
is topped by an even topper male fashion model played by Owen (the nose)
Wilson. Yeah, Stiller and Wilson playing fashion models: Funny premise, huh?
With a kind of 007 (that's Zoolander's IQ) assassination plot thing going
on, brainwashing Zoolander (no detergent required), a runway  &quot;walk-off&quot; and
other nonsense, this flick bulges with stupid, silly, nonsensical humor.
Depending on -your- sense of humor, this film may wear itself out early or
leave you craving seconds. Most will find LOL's aplenty with one helping
sufficient.
