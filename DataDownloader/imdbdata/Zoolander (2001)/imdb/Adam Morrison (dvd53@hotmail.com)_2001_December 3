In plot similar to &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;,Ben Stiller plays a moronic
male model brainwashed to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister,so sweat shops
in that country are not destroyed.<br /><br />Incredibly stupid,yet quite funny comedy has enough laughs(the walk-off
competition,the 2001 Spoof,and a gasoline fight ending in an
explosion)Stiller &amp; Wilson are funny,while Ferrell is bizarre as Mugatu,the
fashion designer.Jerry Stiller has a small role.<br /><br />Rating:***1/2 (out of five)
