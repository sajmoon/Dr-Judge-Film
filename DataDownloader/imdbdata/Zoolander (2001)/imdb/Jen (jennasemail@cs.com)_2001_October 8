Zoolander is the funniest movie I have seen hit theatres since Something
About Mary.  With its jokes about morons, ridiculous outfits, and hilarious
scenarios, if it's comedy you're after, you HAVE to see this movie.<br /><br />Derek Zoolander was well-written, acted, and directed as there is not a
single dull moment in the film. Will Ferrell is brilliant (as always) as
Mugatu, a freakish designer famous for inventing a staple of American
fashion.<br /><br />Ben Stiller makes this movie happen with a solid screenplay, and excellent
supporting characters.<br /><br />It's a fresh concept, complete with lots of physical comedy and hilarious
one-liners.<br /><br />And you'll NEVER look at mermaids (mermen!?) the same way again!
