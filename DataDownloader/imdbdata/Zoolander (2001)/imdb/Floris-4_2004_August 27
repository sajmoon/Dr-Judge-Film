I have noticed this movie divides people as much as anything as. Love it or
loath it; there is no middle-ground. <br /><br />Zoolander offers a much-needed dose of self-deprecation and absurdity that
Hollywood so often lacks. Even comedy nowadays exits only in a self
contained world that takes itself too serious. If you're not into Monty
Python (or ever could be), you're likely to hate this film. However if you
can stand a movie mocking its subject matter (fashion-world) as much as it
does it self, you're gonna love it. <br /><br />All this besides; this is the most quotable movie since the Big Lebowski. If
that doesn't flick your switch, we're not from the same planet.
