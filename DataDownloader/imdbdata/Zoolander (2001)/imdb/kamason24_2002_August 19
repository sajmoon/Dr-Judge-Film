It seems if Ben Stiller isn't able to make animal mistreatment the focus of
his humor, he flops. And he's floppin' all over the trawler
here.<br /><br />Bye the bye, Ben, if you don't want to end up like Chevy Chase, show us you
can be funny without abusing animals. Real comedy is in the brillance of the
performer, not the tragedy he inflicts on a living &quot;prop&quot;.<br /><br />This movie is so bad... come to think of it, it's not even worth trashing.
I'm gonna go clean the house. <br /><br />
