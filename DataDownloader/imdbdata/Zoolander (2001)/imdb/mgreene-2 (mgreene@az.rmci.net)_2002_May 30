Once the viewer can get over Ben Stiller's mildly irritating on-screen
persona as Derek Zoolander, the film actually becomes a somewhat amusing
show. The concept of Zoolander similarly mirrors the Farley Brothers
(Kingpin, Shallow Hal) standard comedic formula where a spoofy, goofy,
dim-witted martyr ends up becoming a hero. And in the end, our hero ends up
saving the day while doing the right thing, and eventually is rewarded with
love. However, the similarities between the films stop there. Zoolander's
obvious strengths are its Austin Powers-like costume and set design where a
lot of flamboyant colors, outfits, and hairdos help keep the movie visually
interesting, while giving it an almost post modern feel. Unfortunately, this
aspect of the film is somewhat exacerbated by the gimmicky post-production
and editing techniques employed. As expected, the acting is reliable and
sound, especially Owen Wilson, who has a natural on-screen presence and is
humorous, yet believable in just about every movie he co-stars in.<br /><br />The script has both an upside and several drawbacks.  The male model concept
of the film is quite original, yet as previously mentioned the movie is
formulaic. Also, many of the one-liners and other jokes miss, so although
the movie is entertaining it is not incredibly funny. Furthermore, Zoolander
fails to succeed in delivering one of its primary social commentaries - the
fact that there is more to life than just looks and image. While it does
make the film more entertaining, every back-up in the movie is beautiful and
the film is highly stylized thus adding to the hypocrisy of its message. (In
its defense, the parallel message of sweat shop labor exploitation in 3rd
world countries definitely hits the mark.) The best thing about Zoolander is
the last 30 minutes where the majority of the comic relief appears. It comes
primarily from the supporting cast, especially Wilson and Jerry Stiller and
it really does make the movie a worthwhile viewing, at least for a weekday
night. Overall, Zoolander is an attention-grabbing and unique film that has
its moments, but its too frequent clich&eacute;s and unfunny scenes make it a
no-better than a slightly above average comedy. 6/10
