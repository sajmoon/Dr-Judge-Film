&quot;Zoolander&quot; is a good example of stupid fun. It's nothing great, not quite
hilarious, but it's good if you like Ben Stiller. If you're not into stupid
people's antics, stay away. The reason it was no hit was because it probably
wasn't a good time to see movies, because it was close to September 11. Now
that it's far away, you should rent it, you might be surprised. Grade:
B+
