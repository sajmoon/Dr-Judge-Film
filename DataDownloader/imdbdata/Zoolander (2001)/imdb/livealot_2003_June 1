2003_June 1 

A friend of mine called this the funniest movie that he has ever seen. I
remained doubtful and after seeing it I concluded that my friend either
hasn't seen many movies or has a rather odd taste.<br /><br />It was quite funny in bits but I found myself sitting for long periods of
time with my arms crossed not laughing. I found some of the characters
annoying - especially Mugatu and Katinka. Katinka more than anything.<br /><br />Ben Stiller however was at his best with Zoolander, he's highly talented
at
comedic acting, writing and directing. I look forward to whatever he can
come up with next.<br /><br />Overall, the film lacked a general cohesiveness and while having some
incredibly funny one-liners and being a good spoof of the fashion
industry
just didn't hit the right chord with me. 5/10
