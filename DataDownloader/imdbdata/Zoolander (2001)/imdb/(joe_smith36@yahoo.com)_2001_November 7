After sitting through 'Zoolander' I couldn't help but wonder, &quot;Why would a
comic genius like Ben Stiller make such a lousy movie?&quot;  I know, it was
intended as a satyre of the modeling industry or what ever.  Also, I enjoy
eye candy as much as the next gen-x'er.  But this was just out and out
stupid.  Imagine an hour and a half of the screaming scene in 'Dumb and
Dumber' (an excellent movie) and you'll start to get a picture of
'Zoolander'.  The only couple of somewhat funny scenes were already fully
shown, in context none the less, in the previews.<br /><br />After such genius films as 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Meet the
Parents', I would expect Ben Stiller to make something much better.  This
is
like Tom Hanks making 'Forrest Gump' and THEN 'The Burbs'.  It's all
backwards.  Let's all sit in a big circle, light our lighters, and pray
that
the sequel of 'Meet the Parents' is of the quality Stiller is capable of
and
had shown prior to 'Zoolander'.
