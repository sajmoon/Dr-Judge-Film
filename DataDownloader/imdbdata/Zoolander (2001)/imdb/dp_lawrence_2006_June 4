If you are a sad loser, you will not understand the greatness of this
film! therefore i don&#39;t blame you sad wannabe film critics for giving
this film a poor review. Some of you have obviously not payed enough
attention to detail to some of the jokes. The main reason why i write
is because this was the grandfather of brilliant funny films such as
dodgeball, old school and so on which are all classics.<br /><br />The bit regarding the center for ants was priceless! so how dare you
ppl not give this film a great review! How Dare You! So i conclude with
advising the few people who disliked this film to watch it again and if
you still don&#39;t get the humour then just pipe down and &quot;put a cork in
it (Zane)&quot;!! Peace out P.S. watch the ladies man! Well funny!
