God help me, I love movies about dumb guys, and this one is definitely a
dumb-guy classic. And believe it or not, it's all rather good-natured
humor.
I'd say it's the best Ben Stiller movie I've seen so far, just edging out
&quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and not a gross-out flick like &quot;Something About Mary.&quot;
OK, it's totally silly and frivolous, but it's silliness and frivolity at
it's best. The best scenes are the brainwashing segment and the &quot;walkoff&quot;
between Zoolander and Hansel with David Bowie as referee. And it's great
to
see Ben and his dad working together.
