Derek Zoolander is a male model at the end of his career, looking for life
besides being really, really, ridiculously good-looking.  this movie is
stupid.  This movie is funny.  Ben Stiller is good as the idiotic Derek
Zoolander.  Owen Wilson does great as Hansel, also an idiot male model. 
Christine taylor is very hot and she did very good in this, too.  I'm
surprised they didn't nominate Jon Voight for an Academy Award for this
(sarcasm).  they nominated for Ali, and his part wasn't that big.  They made
him sound like he was the star of the movie in Pearl Harbor, when he's in
their for 2 minutes.<br /><br />Overall the movie is good stupid comedy and I recommend it.  Rating 9 out of
10.
