As I watched Zoolander at a press screening on Friday, one thought kept
coming to my mind: &quot;This is just what I needed&quot;.  Zoolander is a no-brainer
comedy that shovels on the laughs non-stop.  It's a movie that you can go
into and forget your worries for an hour and a half.  By no means should
this movie by nominated for Best Picture, but they weren't trying to.  I
could go into plot specifics, but that would just give everything away.
Just
&quot;Relax&quot; and go see one very funny movie.<br /><br />Peace!
