This is perhaps the finest cinematic achievement of all time.  Wilson's
performance is stellar and Stiller's makes you pee your pants with laughter
(even if you don't have a pre-existing condition).  Wonderful, wonderful
movie.  So great, I've actually changed my name to Derek Hansel Zoolander to
celebrate this triumph of a movie!  One particular excellent scene is when
the three models die in a &quot;freak gasoline fight accident.&quot;  The look of
terror on Stiller's face when his friends are about to be blown to
smitherines is priceless.  You can't learn that kind of acting at a school. 
That's natural born talent right there.  Bottom line:  This movie is
Stiller's, Wilson's, and Ferrel's finest hours and should have been
nominated for the academy awards.  It's a pure crime is wasn't.  Death to
Oscar!!!
