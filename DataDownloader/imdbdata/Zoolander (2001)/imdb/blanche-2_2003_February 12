This is one of those movies you either get the sensibility of or you
just don&#39;t. I was laughing out loud so that will tell you where I am.
Zoolander is an elaborate skit peppered with music videos and it&#39;s
hysterical. I love the against type casting of Ben Stiller and Owen
Wilson as supermodels and all the cameos are fun. The premise is very
funny, as is the total send-up of the modeling business. This is the
kind of frothy, mind candy entertainment that we all need once in a
while. Take it on that level and you won&#39;t be disappointed. The first
part of the movie is the funniest; it falls apart later on and then
just becomes stupid. <br /><br />Recommended if you&#39;re feeling silly and the thought of Ben Stiller as a
model makes you laugh.
