Ben Stiller has one joke and that one joke is a facial expression.  That
should tell you where he'll rank in the pantheon of comic greats.  If you've
never seen Ben's joke before, then please watch this movie.  I, however,
would rather stab myself in the neck with a screwdriver than watch this dung
again.
