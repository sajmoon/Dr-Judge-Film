This is a cute movie. It's not a laugh out loud comedy. But one that's more
amusing because of it's characters. The movie is more or less plotless. The
whole kill the Malyasian(sp?) prime minster thing seemed like a excuse to 
declare that Zoolander has a plot. Kind of like Wayne and Garth moving their
show up in the world in Wayne's World. The cameos come fast and furious.
Being a marketing major I felt the ads parodies were right on the mark. I
really enjoyed Will Ferrell in this movie. He looks and acts like a James
Bond bad guy on acid. I also loved all the 80's music.  Is it just me or
does Hansel with his long, blond hair, crooked nose, muscular body and
fringe jackets look a lot like a young Roger Daltry? Overall a nice and
entertaining time filler. Though I have a strange feeling this movie will be
very, very dated in the future.
