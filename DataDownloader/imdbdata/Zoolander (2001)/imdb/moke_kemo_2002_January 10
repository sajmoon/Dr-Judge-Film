i was asking me this question all time long since i have made the mistake
to
go in this movie. it was from the beginning the one of the worst films i
have ever seen in my life. not that i had great expectations, the movie on
its own was bad enough to fullfit this place in my movie-stats. i can
understand that the character of zoolander is good enough to be part of a
fashion-award-show and also good enough for some jokes but it is definitly
not enough to make a movie of it. i supose the studios gave stiller the
money for this movie without reading the script. but i`ve been strong.
i`ve
waited to the end to build up my meaning about this movie. honestly i
hoped
the movie could become a little better but it hasnt. the movie is made for
idiots by idiots, cause a healthy mind couldn`t have made this
rubbish.
