This film had some promise, owing to the original premise of its plot.
However, Ben has decided to ditch the idea of having a straight spoof
of the fashion industry and fill the movie with 'off the wall'
nonsense. Also, unfortunately Ben Stiller has decided to put himself in
it which ultimately dooms any hope of greatness. He has also chosen to
lace it with a banal script, tedious characters, and droning soulless
techno music. <br /><br />I wont bother explaining the wacky plot, as it only - temporarily
-distracts us from how badly produced the rest of the movie is.
Basically though, Ben Stiller(Derek) is an Adam Sandler type character,
but he fails to emulate even above the direness of 'Going Overboard',
which is the worst movie I have ever seen next to this. Co-star Owen
Wilson(Hansel), a rival model continues his trade mark one-dimension
characters in this bout of shoddiness. Also, how could someone(Wilson)
with a fractured nose get the position for a male model? Ben Stiller
has to go back to Kindergarten and learn how to act, and develop
funniness, although I am a little pessimistic about his chances.
