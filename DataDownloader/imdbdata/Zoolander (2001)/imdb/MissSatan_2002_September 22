<br /><br />To start with I have to say I hate Meet the Parents, prior to Zoolander I
also really disliked Ben Stiller movies. To look at, this movie looked
like
a pile of crud, I refused to see it at the theatre and only hired it at
the
last minute at the vid shop cause everything else was gone. Now I own a
copy
and make everyone I know watch it with me everytime they come over.<br /><br />Zoolander is a great movie purely intended for giggles and memorable
lines.
&quot;orange mocha frappachino!&quot;
If you have previously enjoyed Ben Stiller movies along the lines of &quot;ha
ha
hurty pain is funny. owwy that ball in my crotch, haha. lets strangle this
dog n set fire to this cat&quot; then dont bother seeing Zoolander, its just
not
the same. However if you have a sense of humour which doesnt revolve
around
maiming animals give it a go, its classic, culty n plenty of fun. Owen
Wilson rocks in it but I could have done without Marsha
Brady.
See it see it see it, or someone will be reading your
'you-googley'
