I think Ben Stiller is usually quite funny, especially in Meet the
Parents (update as of 12/04: his shtick is now growing weary), but
Zoolander is one of his worst. There are few funny moments that I
actually laughed at. Even though Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are best
buds and frequently work together in films, it didn't help the rest of
the movie at all. The female love interest of Derek Zoolander lacked
charisma, and though Ben's real life dad Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld) was
in this, he couldn't save it either.<br /><br />Zoolander is a huge misfire because it tries to target a specific age
group and, I think, fails mostly due to the fact that it's not nearly
as funny as it thinks it is. Sure, it has a few funny cameos from the
likes of Billy Zane, David Duchovny and Will Ferrell, and there are a
few funny one-liners including &quot;How are the children supposed to learn
to read if they can't even fit inside the building?&quot;, but if you've
already seen the trailer...you've seen the best bits.<br /><br />2.5/5
