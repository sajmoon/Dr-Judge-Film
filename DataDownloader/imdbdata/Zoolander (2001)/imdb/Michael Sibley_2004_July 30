How can anyone think that &quot;Zoolander&quot; is a good movie. If anyone thinks
&quot;Zoolander&quot; is a good movie; they would be wrong. &quot;Zoolander&quot; is the type of
movie where everyone shakes their head in disbelief wondering why the movie
was made. Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Christine Taylor star as the leads
along with many talented actor making cameos in a film that makes no sense.<br /><br />The director of &quot;Zoolander&quot; failed to make a connection between the audience
to watch and the reason he made the movie. Furthermore, the writers did a
dismal job at convincing everyone that their was a reason to watch as they
utilized stupid jokes, bad physical comedy and awful writing in the script.
It is unfortunate that &quot;Zoolander&quot; turned out to the way it did because
Stiller and Wilson are both excellent talents. The chemistry between both
actors are excellent but it was not enough to sway my opinion of the movie.
