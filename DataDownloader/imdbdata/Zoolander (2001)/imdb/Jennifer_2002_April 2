2002_April 2 

Ok, I guess my review can't stand for too much, but I did manage to get
through about an hour before realizing there were better things I could be
doing with my time... There are some really funny parts, but they're few and
far between. The only cool thing was the fact that there were a whole bunch
of cool people in the movie... Will Ferrell, Andy Dick, Owen Wilson... But
seriously, don't watch this movie if you are a busy person, like myself. You
will end up wondering why you didn't just go to sleep instead.
