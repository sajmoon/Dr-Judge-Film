A review by Robert Peters, magisterpeters@t-online.de:
This is a film without deeper meaning, without a message, this is just
hilariously funny good stuff, brilliant nonsense. Ben Stiller plays Ben
Stiller, and he plays this role very well. Owen Wilson plays Owen Wilson,
and he, too, is brilliant. The movie is full of good jokes and good
routines. You can have a lot to laugh about at the end of the day and
sometimes this is we really want, isn`t it? Very precise observations of the
modelling world lead to an intelligent screenplay and good, ironic
performances. You must watch the movie twice or three times to get all the
lines and jokes and that`s a pretty good sign for a comedy.
