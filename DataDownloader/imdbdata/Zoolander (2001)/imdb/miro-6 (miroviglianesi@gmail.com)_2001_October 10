What Altman could not.......yes, Stiller could.
This very very funny movie took half inspiration by &quot;Pret a porter&quot;
and
another half from &quot;Austin Powers&quot;. Results: Very better than the other two.
Stiller is a genius and for sure he will gave other very
funny
movies to us. Go and laugh.
