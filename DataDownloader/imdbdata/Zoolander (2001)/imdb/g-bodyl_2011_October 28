Zoolander is nothing more than an average movie. To be honest, I
expected more out of it. I heard so many good things about it and I&#x27;m a
big fan of both Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller, but in a way I was
disappointed. I thought that I would be giving this movie a ten but I
deserves a seven at max.<br /><br />This is about a fashion mogul Derek Zoolander who is being brainwashed
so he could assassinate the President of Malaysia.<br /><br />The acting is good but not great. I was kind of annoyed at Ben
Stiller&#x27;s accent in the movie. I did enjoy the performances by Owen
Wilson and Will Ferrell though.<br /><br />I thought this movie would have me cracking up during the whole movie
but it did not. It still had plenty of big laughs though. I just loved
the whole beginning at the awards show.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent but flawed movie. I&#x27;m skeptical over the
upcoming Zoolander sequel(if it&#x27;s ever made). I rate this film 7/10.
