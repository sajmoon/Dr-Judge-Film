For all the people that gave Zoolander a bad review, they were obviously
thinking too hard about the movie.  I thought the movie was hilarious.
The
jokes weren't intelligent, but the movie wasn't meant to be intelligent.
Will Ferrell as Mugatu couldn't have been cast any better.  OBEY MY
DOG!!!!
How often do you get to see a gasoline fight.  Just watch the movie with
an
open mind and you won't be dissapointed.
