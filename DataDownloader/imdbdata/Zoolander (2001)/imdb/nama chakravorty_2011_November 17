Stationery Warning: &#x27;Zoolander&#x27; is NOT meant for the Pseudo
Intellulectuals nor is it for those who prefer black-comedies.
&#x27;Zoolander&#x27; is non-stop, non-sense, yet funny &#x26; lively. Sure, it&#x27;s not
laugh-out-loud funny, but it hits the right points on more than one or
two occasions. <br /><br />&#x27;Zoolander&#x27; Synopsis: At the end of his career, a clueless fashion
model is brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia.<br /><br />Late Drake Sather, John Hamburg &#x26; Ben Stiller&#x27;s Screenplay is wild,
funny &#x26; nuts. The characters, the situations, the entire execution,
everything is either over-the-top or completely zany. Yet, it raises
the correct amount of hilarious moments, that make this one a genuine
slap-stick entertainer. <br /><br />Stiller&#x27;s Direction, on the other-hand, is fast. Cinematography,
Editing &#x26; Art Design, are appropriate. Costume Design, is quite good. <br /><br />Performance-Wise: Stiller is superb as Zoolander. He plays the
dimwitted model, with great energy. Christine Taylor supports well.
Owen Wilson is astonishing as Zoolander&#x27;s opposition. He brings the
house down with his impeccable comic-timing. Will Ferrell is funnily
menacing. Milla Jovovich is perfect. Jon Voight &#x26; David Duchovny are
memorable in brief roles. Others lend good support. <br /><br />On the whole, &#x27;Zoolander&#x27; has, and will always, appeal to those, who
relish slap-stick comedies.
