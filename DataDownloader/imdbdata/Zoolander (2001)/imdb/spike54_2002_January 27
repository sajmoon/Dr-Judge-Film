A bit better than Mystery Men, at least it moves along at a faster clip
and
the jokes come at you quickly enough that when 3 or 4 fall flat, the next
one might hit you.  Overall, I think it should have been funnier than it
was, but perhaps it's a bit hard to send up something (male fashion
modeling) that's already something of a send-up on its own.  Most of the
fun
comes from the cameo appearances, Jon Voight as Zoolander's father, David
Bowie refereeing the &quot;walk off&quot;, even the bizarre cameo by Andy
Dick.<br /><br />I'll ask the same question that Roger Ebert did.  Why did they have to
pick
on Malaysia for this?  Why not use a fictitious country (as the Marx Bros.
did in Duck Soup, Peter Sellers in Mouse That Roared, dozens of other
references)?<br /><br />And then, once having chosen Malaysia, why is everything about it
completely
inaccurate?  Never mind the fact that the &quot;news shots&quot; in Malaysia show
signs in English and Arabic, which is completely wrong.  What about the
fact
that at the end, when Zoolander addresses the Malaysian PM in what the
audience will assume to be Malaysian, he's actually speaking Bahasa
Indonesia?  Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.<br /><br />
