This film is very very funny. The underlying slams to the industry are
done
so well that they take my breath away with laughter!! Ben Stiller is
amazing. I think he's the best male comedian out there. Everyone in this
film was really good. It's visually pleasing and the pacing is perfect. If
you like to go on adventures and love to be entertained by out and out
slamming humor, see this film!!
