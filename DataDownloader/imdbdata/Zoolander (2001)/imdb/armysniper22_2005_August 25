Hi, first i would like to say that i gave this movie a 10 because it is
just hilarious, i find Ben Stillers acting more humorous every time i
watch &quot;Zoolander&quot;.Other great actors including Owen Wilson, and Will
Ferrel could not have a done a better job with their Characters. This
is one of those movies that i can just watch over and over again
without getting tired of it. I think one of the big highlights in this
movie is the Characters and their stories, it really was a great job!
If you like comedies and stupid humor this is a movie for you! One of a
kind, See it! Other Movies of interest that seem to be related to this
film would be: Anchorman, Oldschool, Dodgeball.
