Ben Stiller has done it again, another great comedy to add to his already
large list of great comedies.  This movie is a VERY bizarre movie, the
comedy is just STUPID, but HILARIOUS!!!  There are a few scenes in
particular that make me laugh just thinking about them.  There are
undoubtably people that are going to hate this sort of comedy, but I thought
it was hilarious.  I just love the absurdity of the jokes and the
characters.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are a great team, and I can't wait
to see their next joint effort.  Will Ferrell and Christine Taylor also pull
off a great performance as well.  And there are a number of great actors and
cameo's in this film.  I thought the movie was hilarious and well worth my
money, I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.  Thanks for
reading,<br /><br />-Chris
