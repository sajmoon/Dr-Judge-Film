&quot;Zoolander&quot; holds a special place in my heart because it was the first
theatrically released film I saw after 9/11. It was just one of those
laugh-out-loud movies I needed to see, although I didn&#39;t know it when I
paid for my movie ticket. I just came to the movie theater not
expecting much other than a few pretty-good trailers I saw online, and
ended up nearly falling out of my seat laughing at the sheer
ridiculousness of it.<br /><br />Ben Stiller really nails the character of Derek Zoolander and doesn&#39;t
miss a beat. Zoolander is an incredibly ignorant individual, but not
entirely stupid. His intentions are good, although sometimes misguided,
and it makes for some really good comedy. The scene where he throws the
miniature model of a building to the ground is still absolutely funny
even though I know the scene by heart. Stiller really takes that scene
and sells it.<br /><br />Christine Taylor is also incredibly good in her role. This was probably
the role for her where she stopped being known as &quot;the woman who played
Marsha Brady in the movies&quot;, yet her resemblance to Maureen McCormack
is still very striking. No matter, she played someone who was
convincingly smart, and she played a great straight man (or woman) to
Stiller and the equally ignorant Owen Wilson.<br /><br />Was this film perfect? Of course not, but I still liked it better than
many film critics did at the time. Richard Roeper, a film critic whom I
usually agree with, hated this film. Roeper said that the film made fun
of male models when they really make fun of themselves in reality,
using Fabio as an example. However, I saw this film not so much making
fun of male models specifically, or even models themselves, but more
the fashion industry and its seemingly self-centered nature. I also
thought it was a great and unexpected way for VH1, who partially
produced the film, to make fun of their pre-&quot;I Love The &#39;80&#39;s&quot; image.
Sure, the celebrity cameos were a bit much at times, but they really
didn&#39;t overshadow the overall humor and appeal of the movie (at least
not to this reviewer).<br /><br />The other problem critics had with this movie was using Malasia as a
major plot point, and not a fictional country. In reality, Malasia has
been democratic for decades, and is considered a U.S. ally. The critics
probably have a point here, but at the same time, Malasia wasn&#39;t being
made fun of in this movie, nor were there any hurtful, low-brow
attempts at humor through racial stereotyping. Using a fictional
country probably would have been better, but no movie is perfect.<br /><br />Despite the bad reviews, &quot;Zoolander&quot; went on to find an audience,
particularly when it was released on video. I hear people my age
quoting lines from the movie all the time, and the main people in the
cast have gone on to bigger and better things. It&#39;s just that funny a
movie, and I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only person that thinks so.
