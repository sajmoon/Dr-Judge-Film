Derek Zoolander is a top male super-model, who has won the VH1 'Male Model
of the Year' award three times. On his fourth year of being nominated Derek
expects to win, but unfortunately he doesn't. Instead new model on the
block, Hansel, is the one who gets the award. After his fall, Derek then
decides to quit the world of modelling and decides to go and find his
family, his father and two brothers who all work at a cole-mine. Things
aren't going well for a while, until things begin to look up when strange
designer Mugatu offers Zoolander a chance to make a comeback in the model
world with his new 'Derelicte' Line. What Zoolander and nobody else realise
at first is that Mugatu plans to use Zoolander in his plan to assassinate
the new Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit to New York, by brainwashing
him with the help of his horrible assistant Katinka. Time Magazine
journalist Matilda is the one who finds out about the planned assassination
and is the one, with the help of Hansel, who helps Zoolander to stop Mugatu
from doing this awful thing.<br /><br />As well as starring in the movie, Ben Stiller also directs and writes the
screenplay. Real life father Jerry Stiller also stars here and he's great as
usual. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor also has a part in here
too. Owen Wilson gives quite a good performance too. There are LOADS of cool
cameos in the movie too from the likes of Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder,
David Duchovny and Jon Voight. <br /><br />Zoolander is definitely different to many of Ben Stiller's other movies, but
with Stiller anything is enjoyable. He's simply one of the best comedy
actors, writers, etc. around. There are some really funny moments here in
the movie too, most with Stiller and the movie is very clever. I think it
would be great if they made a sequel to this cool, original movie.
