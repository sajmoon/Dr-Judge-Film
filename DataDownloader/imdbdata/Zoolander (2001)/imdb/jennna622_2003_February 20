Ben Stiller has done it again.  Yes, Zoolander came out over a year ago,
but
i still cannot stop talking about it.  I quote it whenever possible, own
3
copies of the movie (so i can lend some out of course), and have gotten
all
of my friends hooked on Zoo.  This film belongs to Will Ferrell and Owen
Wilson.  Ben Stiller is great as well, but without these 2 actors this
film
would not be nearly as funny as it is.  When people don't like this
movie, i
take personal offense.  It's comic genius!  Ben, Owen, Will, and the rest
of
the gang deserve medals for brightening up my life!  I LOVE THIS MOVIE.
IF
YOU'RE CONTEMPLATING SEEING IT...STOP!  JUST GO AND SEE IT!  if you live
on
Long Island i'll even lend you a copy :)
