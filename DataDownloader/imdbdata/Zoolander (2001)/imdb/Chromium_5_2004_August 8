I didn't expect this to be spectacular, but I also didn't expect it to be so
totally bad that I kept wondering why on earth I was even watching it. The
really sad thing is that it COULD have been good. Stiller Sr., Stiller Jr.,
Wilson, and Ferrell are quite capable of being funny, and a spoof of the
fashion industry is a good idea, but the movie is ruined by a terrible
script. They were obviously going for the so-stupid-it's-funny brand of
humor, but they overdid it in the stupidness department, and it resulted in
a movie that's so-stupid-it's-unwatchable. I couldn't believe it when they
actually had a wedgie joke. You know a comedy is getting desperate for
laughs when it throws in a wedgie joke. I admit there are a few good jokes
in here (the &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; parody was great), but not nearly enough to
save it. <br /><br />I give &quot;Zoolander&quot; 3 stars, which also happens to be the same amount of
times I laughed.
