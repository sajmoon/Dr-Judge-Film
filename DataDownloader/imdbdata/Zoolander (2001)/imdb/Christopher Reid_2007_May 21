In 2001, the stupid-comedy sub genre of film was changed forever by one
film. That film was Zoolander, which has since become one of the most
commonly quoted/referenced films among the growing number of people
that have been affected by it. Never before had a comedy at this level
of stupidity been attempted. In its dumbest moments, Zoolander is
second to none. Where Zoolander lags is in its attempts to develop a
meaningful plot and moral to the story. Luckily, this is not often and
the result is a classic with countless unforgettable moments.<br /><br />I think Zoolander owes the majority of its greatness to its actors as
opposed to the writing or directing for example, which are quite
inventive at times but otherwise nothing special. Owen Wilson is
arguably the heart of the film although Will Ferrel, Jerry Stiller and
of course Ben Stiller have their moments. The numerous cameo
appearances (most notably David Duchovny and David Bowie) also turn out
to be well executed opportunities for hilarity.<br /><br />Now, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much more I can really say about Zoolander.
Some people might not like it but then they obviously just don&#39;t get
it. Perhaps they just need to carefully consider the question &quot;But why
male models?&quot; one more time and then finally they will appreciate the
inevitably apparent fact that &quot;Dear God ... it&#39;s beautiful.&quot;
