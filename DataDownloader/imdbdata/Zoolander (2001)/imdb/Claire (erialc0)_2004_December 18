Since Zoolander was released, I think I can safely say that it's become
one of the most popular dumb comedies of the past ten years (a decade
that was all too saturated with dumb comedies). Maybe it's the
tongue-in-cheek attitude, or the clever writing, or the fact that it's
immensely quotable (&quot;I'm pretty sure there's more to life than being
really, really, ridiculously good looking&quot;). But whatever it is, it
makes for a terrifically fun movie.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is Derek Zoolander, three-time male model of the year,
whose brainpower never quite caught up to his really, really ridiculous
good looks. After losing his title to up-and-coming model Hansel (he's
so hot right now), played by a Zen-ed out Owen Wilson, and the death of
three of his model friends in a tragic gasoline fight accident, he goes
on a quest to find his purpose in life. Turns out, his purpose in life
is as the face of Mugatu (Will Ferrel with the world's best hair)'s new
Derelicte fashion campaign--or so he's led to believe.<br /><br />The plot is not strong. The characters are not fleshed out. But Ben
Stiller keeps Derek's stupidity hysterical instead of irritating, and
the rest of the cast adds gimmick after gimmick to keep things running.
(Come on, the coal mines of New Jersey? Tell me that's not funny.)
