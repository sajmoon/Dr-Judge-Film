Zoolander is a satire film, but unlike other films, this one touches a
new territory, male modelling. This was an interesting experience for
me because I have no real interest in male modelling and know very
little about the subject.<br /><br />Despite this, I enjoyed it. The plot goes somewhat like this. Derek
Zoolander, famous male model, is humiliated when his enemy, Hansel,
wins the award he was aiming for. When his friends try to cheer him up,
they all die in an explosion. <br /><br />Meenwhile, evil fashion designer Mugatu, is plotting to kill the Prime
Minister of Malaysia for his new policy against sweatshops, and he
needs, Derek Zoolaner, the single stupidest male model in existence, to
do it for him.<br /><br />Zoolander, Hansel and Mugatu are two of the funniest characters I have
ever seen. The other characters though, are a little bland. I don&#39;t
hate them, I just think they&#39;re a little bit boring.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie with a funny main lead, original premise, but
some slightly boring support characters.
