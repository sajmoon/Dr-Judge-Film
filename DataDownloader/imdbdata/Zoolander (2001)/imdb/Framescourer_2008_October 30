I like Ben Stiller, which is a difficult occupation because he has a
tendency to disappoint. Not so in this satire-comedy on the fashion
industry which gives him and his friends a chance to dress up and muck
about safe in the knowledge that almost anything they seem to do on the
screen it won&#39;t be half as preposterous as what occurs on real
catwalks.<br /><br />Central to the self-perpetuating industrial gags is Stiller&#39;s &#39;look&#39;,
&#39;Blue Steel&#39;, a sort of calling-card pout, which also serves (alongside
stylised editing) as a sort of wink at the audience, &#39;OK, I&#39;m actually
being a model now&#39;. Stiller has to deal with real life (temporary
retirement after the hilarious demise of a colleague, lampooning the
world of Herb Ritts photography in a mineshaft) and then competition on
resumption of his modelling with the equally game Owen Wilson. David
Bowie has a cameo which is reason enough to go alone. 6/10
