There were some genuinely funny moments in this film, like the brainwash
sequence and the orgy scene, but most of the jokes were kind of hit or miss.
 I liked all the great little cameo appearances by some recognizable faces,
and many of the fashion gags were scathingly satirical.  Not really
laugh-out-loud funny, but humorous in goofy way.  Stiller's
stupid-male-model act can be a little grating after awhile, but the
performances by Ben's father Jerry Stiller and comedian Will Ferrell really
stood out over everything.  <br /><br />I must say, the more I see Will Ferrell, the more I fall in love with his
glib, comedic style.  He is just a naturally funny guy.  This can be seen
all the more if you watch the DVD version which has all the extended/deleted
scenes and outtakes.  The man is absolutely hilarious, and I can say without
a doubt that the Bonus material is funnier than the movie
itself.<br /><br />All in all, a 7/10 because I'm feeling generous and because of Jerry Stiller
and Will Ferrell.
