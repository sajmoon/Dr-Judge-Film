Ben Stiller and Owen Willson star as two rivals in the hectic world of
male modelling. There follows a pretty non-sensical plot about remote
controlled assassins and an attempt at social commentary on low wages
in the third world. But it&#39;s the dumb humour that sticks in the mind,
Stiller and Wilson spark well off each other and it&#39;s clear their
having a blast lampooning the fashion industry. The walk off scene
(with a guest appearance from David Bowie) is one of the funniest iv&#39;e
seen in ages.<br /><br />Will Ferrels appearance as the evil Mugatu has to be see to be believed
it&#39;s side splitting. If you liked films such as Dodgeball and Anchorman
you&#39;ll be at home with Zoolander. Zoolander is a dumb movie with little
or no plot but its extremely funny and thats what comedy is all about.
