This movie is what that other member said just what you need to forget your
problems it is VERY funny! Most of the time I was laughing but also saying
to myself What The Hell?? Like everybody else who was watching. You cannot
help but laugh at how messed up this movie is! Ben Stiller has proven
himself worthy by my standards, and he needs to make more movies. I hope he
does soon. Once again Roger Ebert just doesnt get it.
