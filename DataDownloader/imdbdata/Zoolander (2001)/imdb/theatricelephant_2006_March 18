This movie was a great, very silly comedy to watch with friends. We all
enjoyed it and like to crack each other up with its hilarious one
liners! It's basically the story of the fading career of a once
super-hot model, Derek Zoolander. He is being knocked out of the
modeling business by new, boyish Hansel (Owen Wilson). Derek is
brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. The story in
between is the good part, however. Full of wittier humor than the very
blunt lines of Dodgeball. Still stupid-funny enough for the shallowest
of us to understand. I would definitely recommend this movie to teens
and adults who want something that is easy to watch yet keeps you
absorbed, and something that will take your mind off your own life for
a while. Its humor will brighten your day a bit.
