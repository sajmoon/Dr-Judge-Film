2002_January 8 

When I saw the first trailer for &quot;Zoolander&quot;, I believed that this might be
one of those comedies which give the best jokes away in the trailer and
leave you disappointed in the theater.<br /><br />Well I was wrong!<br /><br />Zoolander is a quite exhilarating movie full of allusions and hints to other
big movies and of course some real live fashion designers. It is fun to
search for all these tidbits, see all the cameos of people like Stephen
Dorff or David Bowie and my absolute favorites were Zoolanders quote of &quot;The
Godfather&quot; and the surprisingly intelligent side blow to &quot;2001 - A space
odyssey&quot;!<br /><br />Furthermore, as a child of the 80s I really enjoyed the homage which was
shown to this decade in the movie, especially the music.<br /><br />So all in all a really enjoyable film with many little things to watch out
for. There is so much to find that I probably have missed quite a few
further innuendos...
