Fruity fashion models that are bunch of airheads(I think too much gel caused
their brain to not function properly.), fashion designer that's psycho(Will
Ferrell playing as Jacobim Mugatu) yet also fruity. The characters are
really weird and gets annoying at times but they are really funny. Christine
Taylor(that was on &quot;Hey Dude&quot; on Nickelodeon, I watched that show when I was
little) was like the only person in the movie that was normal. She was the
one who had to keep saying stuff like &quot;What are you guys talking about?&quot;
scenes which made some of the lame jokes funny. Her performance was great, a
lot better then Wedding Singer. You can see Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are
good friends in real life with this movie. They're really funny when they're
on screen together. I can see where Ben Stiller gets his personalities, his
real father was in this movie and acted weird like everyone else but had his
funny moments. Will Ferrell is just too funny, he can act really stupid and
yet still be really funny. He kept saying &quot;Hansel is hot right now.&quot; when
Hansel appeared and I couldn't stop laughing at that. Milla Jovovich? I
thought she looked and performed better in Resident Evil.<br /><br />3 Fruity guys hosing themselves with gasoline and one lights a cigarette,
when Derek Zoolander saw that he was screaming &quot;Nooo&quot;. I guess Ben Stiller
wasn't as stupid as those 3 knowing what would happen if you light a fire
near gasoline. Mugatu should of hired one of those 3 to get brainwashed and
get the prime minister. Oh well, just a thought.<br /><br />There's constant humor, some being beyond stupid and some being really
funny. I really liked &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; and as much as Zoolander is stupid, it
is pretty funny and gave us something new to watch so I enjoyed it. The
movie is about 2 hours long but it goes by pretty fast. It has great music,
a lot of celeberties, and some really funny scenes. I thought Ben Stiller
did a good job directing again.<br /><br />A movie for laughs. If comedy movies stress you out then skip
this.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 7/10
