I admit that the first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it one bit.  I
thought it was dumb, not funny and annoying.  But the more I watch it, the
more I love it!  it is really funny once you shut your brain down and enjoy
it.<br /><br />it's about a super-dumb male model, Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) who has
been brain-washed by Jacobin Mugatu (Will Ferrell) to kill the Prime
Minister of Malaysia.  The plot is interesting, and the dialogs are pretty
clever.  The performances were pretty good as well, Ben Stiller was good as
Zollander, I mean he makes you feel annoyed over him, which i think was the
whole point, considering that Derek is the most stupid guy ever!  There were
some pretty good performances from Christine Taylor, Jerry Stiller, Milla
Jovovich and of course Owen Wilson.  But the best actor in this movie is
definitely Will Ferrell, he cracks me up as Mugatu, and steals every single
scene! <br /><br />Another great thing about this comedy is all the celebrities!  We get to see
Christian Slater, Nataly Portman, David Bowie, Steve Kmetko, Fred Durst,
etc....  It really gave it a touch.  The direction was fairly good.  The
music was really good, it has lots and lots of good songs.<br /><br />I think that somebody who enjoys a good comedy, and doesn't question every
single thing; the you should see this movie.  If you are the  kind of movie
watcher who sees a movie only to find mistakes, then do not see it!  I give
it a **** out of *****
