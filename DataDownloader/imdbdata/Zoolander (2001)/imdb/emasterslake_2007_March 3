When the Prime Minister of Malaysia has announced that child labor will
be no more in his country. Mugatu(an evil clothing model leader) was
outraged about that news, because it&#39;ll lower sales on clothing for
child workers. So he plans to set up an assassination on the prime
minister when he visits the world famous fashion show put up in New
York.<br /><br />And Mugatu will brainwash Derek Zoolander into killing the prime
minister. Derek Zoolander was the most over rated and most popular male
model in New York. Right until his competitor Hansel, out won him at
the best looking male model awards. Which made Zoolander down on his
luck. Because modeling for clothes and being good looking is his life.
And is yet to come up with a new look that&#39;ll be called the Magnum.
Will Zoolander find something else in life besides Male Modeling? And
will Mugatsu successfully succeed in his conspiracy plan? I was never a
fan of Ben Stiller. But I gotta admit that this one is a little better
than his other movies. Owen Wilson is good and also teamed up with
Stiller in &quot;Starsky Hutch&quot;(which wasn&#39;t all that great). And Will
Ferrel&#39;s role as a villain is rather different than his other
appearances. But I&#39;m not a fan of him either.<br /><br />Zoolander is one of those average comedies with some slapstick to it.
If you&#39;re a Ben Stiller fan, you might like this one. But it&#39;s
something to rent before buying.
