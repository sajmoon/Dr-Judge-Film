A hilarious, ridiculous comedy that does a great job of poking fun at
celebrity. Ben Stiller seems to think that fame is rather silly and he shows
his contempt for it in the form of male super-model Derek Zoolander.  The
intellect-challenged, self-absorbed Zoolander pouts, struts and
mispronounces wonderfully throughout this comedy that's aimed at being
stupid.<br /><br />The &quot;plot-line&quot; begins when Derek is targeted by a clandestine fashion
alliance in need of a dim-witted, male super-model.  Fitting the bill to a
tee, Derek is brainwashed via a Clockwork-Orange-esque treatment that orders
him to kill the visiting Prime Minister of Malaysia, whose progressive take
on child-labour laws and sweatshops has become a serious thorn in the side
of the fashion cartel. Whenever Derek hears &quot;Relax&quot; by Frankie Goes To
Hollywood, that's his trigger to kill the Prime Minister.<br /><br />Some movies try so hard at being ridiculous that it actually kills its
comedic value (see &quot;Scary Movie&quot; and &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot;).  It's quite a feat to
maintain a balance, which Zoolander accomplishes. <br /><br />You'll either love or hate this movie.  If you like silly, you'll like
Zoolander. Also, I found that this movie gets better with age, so don't be
so quick to cast it aside.<br /><br />
