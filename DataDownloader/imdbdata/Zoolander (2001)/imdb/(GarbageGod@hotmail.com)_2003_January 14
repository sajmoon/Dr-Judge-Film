this is my favorite comedy, it is an aquired sort of humor so many peopl e
without a sense of humor might not get it.  i can quote every line from
this
movie and everyone should own it.  Ben Stiller and Will Farrel are amazing
comedic actors.  Milla Jahovavich is also hillarious, everything about
this
movie make me laugh, and i give it 10/10<br /><br />&quot;i can derelicte my own balls, thank you&quot;
