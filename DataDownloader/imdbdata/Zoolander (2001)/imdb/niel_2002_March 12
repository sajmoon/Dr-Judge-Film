I can understand Ben Stiller using his father in this. But if he didn't
think this movie unworthy for him he should have considered his father's
career. Ben Stiller is a fine actor but this makes me wonder about his
directorial talent. He took a fine cast and made a movie without much of a
script. There are very few yuks in this. How he can squander his father's
great comedic talent is a mystery. Even more mysterious is his skill at
wasting the talents of Milla Jovovich. One can go the entire movie and not
realize that she's even there. What a waste. If they only had a script and a
few jokes. I expect to see something of Owen Wilson in the not too distant
future.
