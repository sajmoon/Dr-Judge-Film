This movie is absolutely hilarious!  Watch for the cameos -- I have to see
it again to catch them all.  Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Farrell are
the three funniest men on the planet.  Jerry Stiller had me cracking up in
every scene!  If you're ready for a good laugh do yourself a favor and go
see Zoolander!
