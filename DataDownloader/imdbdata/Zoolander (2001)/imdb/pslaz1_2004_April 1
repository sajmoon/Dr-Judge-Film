2004_April 1 

I can't say I finished watching this film thinking it was brilliant. My
first reaction was that it was both funnier and more intelligent that I
expected, but that's not giving it a huge amount of credit in either
regard.
Actually it was quite a bit funnier than I expected, with many moments
that
I couldn't help laugh out loud. Still, it does bring out many of the
cliches
in getting a laugh out of the audience, and while some of these were done
very well it wasn't so consistently brilliant that I would want to watch
it
again and again.<br /><br />Slightly better than disposable this fun and funny movie was better than
your average Hollywood comedy, much better, but it still left me feeling
for
a lack of depth that no great lines can redeem. 7 out of
ten.
