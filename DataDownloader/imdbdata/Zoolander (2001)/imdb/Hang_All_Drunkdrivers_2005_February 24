Ben Stiller plays fashion model Derek zoolander who is really kind of
ugly but more importantly for the story, extremely dumb. I loved it
when his girl friend said she was bulimic and zoo said &quot;You can read
minds&quot;? The bad guys have turned him into a Manchurian candidate to
kill the leader of Malaysia or Micronesia or Eurasia or Crimetia - the
characters keep changing the name of the country.<br /><br />Ben stiller does a great job but what really surprised me was milla
jovovich. I had seen her in the Fifth Element and a Joan of Arc movie
and thought she was gorgeous but the world's worst actress. Here she
plays a black-haired villainess with red eye liner and she does a great
job and is still beautiful.
