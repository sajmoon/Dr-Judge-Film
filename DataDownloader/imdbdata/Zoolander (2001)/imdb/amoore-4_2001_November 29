This is yet another disappointment in a long list of poor movies released in
the last few months. I saw &quot;What's the worst that could happen&quot; last week--I
should have read between the lines: Zoolander. From the opening scenes I
could see that this movie was going to insult my intelligence. Of course, I
would never have bought a ticket knowingly to this movie, so I was prepared
for anything, but I could take only 30 minutes of this trash. I gave it a
chance and them after the fiftieth glare into the camera by Stiller and
having my senses assaulted by the obnoxious 'mugambo' (or something like
that) I walked out. As usual the Austrian audiences loved it. Seems the
weirder the movie, the more they like it.
