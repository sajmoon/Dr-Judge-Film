I'm a fan of this film. I don't know why, the first time I went to see it in
the cinema I wasn't even convinced that the money was well spent. Yet seeing
again you recognize how many great comic and nonsensical elements the film
has to offer... the gas station scene, the walk-off, the
Mulder-Hand-model... a must see, and a cult movie for me.
