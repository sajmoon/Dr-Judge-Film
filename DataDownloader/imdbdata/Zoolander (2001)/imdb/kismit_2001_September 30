Totally unfair generalizations about the world of male modeling, but so
over
the top I can't see anyone being offended. The gas station scene alone was
worth the price of admission. It's not one laugh after another but I had a
smile on my face through the whole film and the funny parts are REALLY
FUNNY. It is the best comedy I have seen in a long time.
