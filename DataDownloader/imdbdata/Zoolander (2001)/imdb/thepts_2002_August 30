I'll admit that this film has some &quot;chuckle&quot;-moments (which never become
full-out laughters), and that the world of male modelling is not of my
favorite movie environments..<br /><br />But: some of the scenes in this movie just makes you laugh your ass off.
Like when Derek gets presented with the classic &quot;temptational buy-out
prize&quot;, in this case a model of to-be school for &quot;Children who cannot read
so good&quot;. I'm not going to spoil what Mr. Zoolander does out of that..
:D<br /><br />If you liked &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, have stayed awake for a longer period than
usual, or for some other reason you are ready to laugh your ass off at utter
stupidity, you should definitively go for this.
