Zoolander/ ** 1/2 stars<br /><br />For once a movie was as good as I expected, and better than others expected.
Zoolander was just hilarious, I mean if you think about it, it was really
dumb, but in a good way. It's not often that you enjoy a movie that is so
dumb, but Zoolander seemed to pull it off.<br /><br />Stiller is once again great in this movie, much like he was in There's
Something About Mary. Stiller seems to add so much more humor to movies, and
he also makes them so much better, I hope he stars in a lot more movie in
the future, seeing as he is such a good actor.<br /><br />Wilson was also really funny in this movie, I was glad to see him in this
role as Hansel, he made the movie a lot better. It seems as though Stiller
and Wilson star in a lot of movies together, which is a good thing since
they are both really funny.<br /><br />Zoolander is a male model who used to be on the top, but with Hansel career
rising, he is on the bottom. But a leading fashion designer needs Zoolander
to be trained to kill the prime minister of Malaysia, and when the Fashion
Awards show comes on, he will be triggered and can't be
stopped.<br /><br />A really hilarious movie, not quite up there with There's Something About
Mary, but still achieves being funny. Hopefully we see more comedies yet
from Wilson and Stiller.
