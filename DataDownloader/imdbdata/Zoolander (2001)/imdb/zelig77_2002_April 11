2002_April 11 

let me first say that i love almost everything ben stiller has ever done,
so i'm a little biased. i don't think the movie warrants extensive
analysis,
but i watched it 3 times in the first week of it's release, and with many
different people, with different tastes, and levels of humor/intelligence.
i
noticed something while watching this with my different groups of friends.
now i love all my bestest pals, but not everyone of them is exactly what
i'd
call a supergenius. in fact some of my friends range from flakey, to
downright morons! anyway, what i noticed is this: my friends which i would
classify as more on the &quot;intelligent&quot; side were laughing their guts out
through the duration of the film, while my &quot;dimmer&quot; friends were stone
cold.
hmmmmm...it was almost as though they didn't get the jokes! weird, huh?
the
jokes that they thought were &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;gay&quot;, as they would put it, were
often the ones that had me, and some others in tears! i'm not sure exactly
how i want to put it, but it's like many of the jokes were some new form
of
&quot;smart-stupid&quot;. i don't know, they were just jokes of the broadest kind,
the
kind that almost stop the movie to say &quot;do you get who i'm making fun of
right now&quot;? you could make the criticism that the jokes were often forced,
but i for one felt relieved that i wasn't the only person who feels
surrounded by idiots now and then. that may sound snobbish, but i don't
care. i'm sick of peolpe who are willing to accept anything the
entertainment industry throws at them. to quote ben stillers pal, jeanenne
garafolo, &quot;there's a part of me that's envious of people who don't care
what's put in there eye hole, ear hole, mouth hole, nose hole, etc. acid
washed jeans? sure. lion king? yes. lion king soundtrack? i'll take one.&quot;
well, i best not get too riled up, i'll go on like this for far too long.
(i
may have already) basically what i'm saying is , i think ben stiller has
succeeded in making a damn funny film, that is , i think, a little more
subversive than given credit for. he's not just picking at fashion, i
think
he's testing the audience a little too. i think the movie is more personal
for him than most people would guess. i loved it.<br /><br />p.s--the dvd has a hilarious narration by ben stiller for each section of
the menu! if anyone cares.<br /><br />p.s.s---i hated supertroopers by comparison, if it helps put this rant
into
perspective.
