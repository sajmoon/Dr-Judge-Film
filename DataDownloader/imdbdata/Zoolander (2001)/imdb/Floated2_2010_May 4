OK so I watched this on television because i was bored. Zoolander is
one of the most wackest Ben Stiller comedies I have ever seen! In this
movie Ben Stiller plays a male model named Derek Zoolander who has a
big competition with another male model named Hansel (Owen Wilson).
After Derek Zoolander lost the male model award at the VH1 Awards and
then his three best friends die in a gas fight accident he decides to
retire. The acting is annoying and Ben Stiller&#x27;s voice is real annoying
and unfunny.<br /><br />But after when Derek retires his boss Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller)
offers him to join Jacobin Mugatu (Will Ferrell) agency. So when Derek
joins Mugatu&#x27;s campaign he gets brainwashed after being in a day spa
and getting brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia! By
brainwashing Zoolander, Mugatu and his evil associate Katinka (Milla
Jovovich) create a dumb and willing killer to do the job. Only in Time
Magazine journalist Matilda (Christine Taylor) suspicion arises slowly,
and she tries to stop Derek.<br /><br />Later in the movie Derek and Hansel start having a friendship between
each other. There were many weird parts but one that I liked was when
they were showing Derek at the day spa and he was listening to relax
and they were showing this crazy video at the same time! I thought this
movie was unfunny and could have been much better done. I don&#x27;t see why
this movie got a lot of praise
