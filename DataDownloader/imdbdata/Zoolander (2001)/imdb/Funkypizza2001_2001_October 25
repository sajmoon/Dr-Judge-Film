When i first saw he preview for Zoolander on television, i seriously thought
that i wasn't going to be a good movie. I thought it looked stupid and i
thought that it would not be entertaining. So when my friends told me that
one day they wanted to see this film, i really wasn't looking forward to it,
but i went anyway, and now i am glad i went. <br /><br />Ben Stiller Movies always put a smile on my face, and this movie really made
me smile and laugh. He plays a stupid supermodel in this film, and he acted
really well... i wonder if he was acting. It had stupid and yet funny jokes
in it. His wife Christine Taylor was in this, and Owen Wilson was in it, who
also starred in &quot;Meet The Parents,&quot; with Ben. I really did enjoy this film,
and i think if you watch it, you will enjoy it for yourself.<br /><br />I give it *** stars out of ***** stars.
