ZOOLANDER (2001) Rating: 3/10<br /><br />Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), he of the famed &quot;Blue Steel&quot; pose, has been
the biggest thing in male modeling for the past few years, gracing
magazine
covers and billboards with his &quot;really really really good looks&quot;, walking
down the runways around the world and attending the trendiest parties with
the hippest celebrities. Yet now trouble is nigh, with not only the hot
new
kid on the block Hansel (Owen Wilson) threatening to steal his thunder and
a
Time reporter (Christine Taylor) making him look like an idiot in an
article
but also evil designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) who brainwashes him
into assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia to stop him from
stopping
child labor and henceforth putting clothes factories into jeopardy.<br /><br />Written like that, it sounds as if ZOOLANDER is quite a complex story, but
all these plot-lines merely feel like afterthoughts. The spin on the
&quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; premise, for instance, is little more than an
excuse
to move from a more-or-less-comic set piece to another. It's based on a 5
minute bit Ben Stiller did for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards which
satirically
confirmed the general impression that models are &quot;vain, stupid and
incredibly self-centered&quot;. The character of Derek Zoolander epitomizes
these
traits, and it's funny enough... for a while. But when that single joke is
stretched to 90 minutes, it gets mighty tedious. Less than halfway though
I
was checking my watch in boredom and wondering how if there was much more
to
go.<br /><br />Stiller, who co-wrote the screenplay and directed, is no hack (I thought
his
previous THE CABLE GUY was a vastly underrated dark comedy), but his film
is
nonetheless generic, uneven and self-indulgent. Stiller gives way too much
screen time to his wife Christine Taylor, who has the thankless role of
the
&quot;serious&quot; chick reporter always conveniently around to handle the plot
exposition and serve as a love interest out of the blue. Ben also cast his
dad Jerry Stiller to more success, as the old guy scores a couple of big
laughs with some dubious material. Also shining through is Will Ferrell,
who
always manages to make me laugh. He's been the best thing about &quot;Saturday
Night Life&quot; for the past decade, and he's hilarious here as a maniacal
Bond
villain of a designer with goofy white curls akin to his pet poodle's.
Owen
Wilson also has his moments as another variation on the neo-hippie/surfer
dude he's been playing in every movie lately. As for Stiller himself, he's
not bad, but this is just such a one note performance... Derek's vain,
stupid and incredibly self-centered, all right, we get it, enough already!<br /><br />All in all, I can't recommend ZOOLANDER. I enjoyed a few parts of it, but
they're lost in an endless string of dumb &amp; dumber jokes, pointless cameos
(I don't think Vince Vaughn has a single line), 80s pop montages and
half-clever spoofs (2001, The Godfather...). There really isn't much to
the
film which couldn't fit in a 2 minute trailer.
