The best advice I can give anyone is to anyone is give this movie a
chance.
Don't go into it expecting your run of the mill Jim Carrey slapstick
routine,
although if that is all you want you will not be disappointed. Much of
this
movie relies on how (un)smart the character dialogue is. In my opinion it
is
the small details that raises this movie above other slapstick comedy's.
Pay
special attention to facial expressions other than &quot;magnum&quot; etc.
Stiller's
face after he has stumbled through a sentence is priceless. The
supporting
cast is excellent as well. Ferrell as Mugatu and Wilson as Hansel are
priceless. One warning it will be impossible to take Owen Wilson
seriously
in any other movie after seeing Zoolander.
Great film for all ages, silly and smart at the same time and definitely
underrated. And don't forget the DVD outakes, Mugatu
especially.
