This is one of the few movies I couldn't be bothered to sit through for
more than 10 or 15 minutes. I will usually sit through an average movie
and get what I can from it, but this one wasn't funny, and wasn't
entertaining. I sort of felt bad for the actors involved as it was
cringe worthy in the extreme.<br /><br />Unimaginative, and stereotyped, uninventive and well, just a plain
waste of time and money by all involved.<br /><br />No accounting for taste, some people seem to give it good reviews, I
can't imagine why, but there we are. At big fat zero out of however
many you measure it by.
