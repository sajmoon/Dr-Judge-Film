The story of this Ben Stiller's effort ranks among the ones that
American cinema particularly has a liking for. The flawless career of a
fellow at first unlikely to succeed his life but who, ultimately will
have become rich, respectable and will have found his place in society.
Stiller must have been influenced by this kind of story for his work.
He acts Derek Zoolander, an eccentric young man who could have spent
his life in poverty due to his limited intellectual faculties. But,
fortunately, the world of fashion rescued him and he became a seasoned
top-model. I must admit that I'm not fond of this kind of topic, very
simply because it seems unlikely to me. A topic like this one prevents
a movie from working well. I will attribute without any hesitation, my
opinion to Stiller's movie. The absence of directing is to deplore as
well as his execrable performance. By his grimaces, the way he talks,
he tries to ape Jim Carrey with a much less convincing result which
gives ludicrous sequences. Moreover, with &quot;Zoolander&quot;, Stiller's
intention was to shot a satire of the world of fashion; but this point
is flown over than denounced. Sorry, Mr Stiller you missed your chance.
At last, it is not a labored and inconsistent screenplay that will make
up the whole. I used the term &quot;inconsistent&quot; because Stiller acts a so
dumb character that it is nearly impossible to imagine him running a
center for children who want to learn to read.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is a humorous piece with ponderous humor. If Ben Stiller
proved himself as an actor (although &quot;Zoolander&quot; doesn't belong to his
major opus), he still has serious improvement to do at the level of
directing. Really, the year 2001 wasn't a good one for American
comedies. Only, Wes Anderson played his game well with the witty &quot;the
Royal Tenenbaums&quot; that year...
