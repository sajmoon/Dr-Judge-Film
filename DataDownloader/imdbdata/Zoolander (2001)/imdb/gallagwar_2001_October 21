this was one of the funniest movies start to finish i've ever seen.  god
bless ben stiller.  stiller, ferrell, and wilson are beyond perfection, and
the endless cameos only add to the humor.  david bowie was amazing.  as was
vince vaughan, who was in the movie for about 7 minutes, yet did not have 1
line. brilliant.  throughout the entire length of the movie, there were
about 3 minutes that i wasn't laughing hysterically.
