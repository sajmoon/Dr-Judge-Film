This is one of the funniest comedies I've seen.  A true spoof of the male
modeling industry and how models behave humorously in the world around
them.
Ben Stiller was funny-weird but not funny-ha hah as the clothing and
catalog model zoolander.  The real reason I loved this movie was for Will
Farrel's hilarious performance as the villain.  I only remember laughing
this
hard seeing this as I did on &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;.  Half of the friends and
relatives I know who saw this liked it.  Zoolander is a well written
spoof
on modeling and fashion.
