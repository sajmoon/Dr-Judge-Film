One of the unfunniest comedies in a long time. Ben Stiller possesses no mean
talent but must have knocked this one out on an off-day, or however many
off-days it took to make. The whole point of the film, which everybody knows
already anyway, is revealed early on, and it's &#145;models are dumb'. The same
point is being relentlessly hammered home over an hour later after the
braindead plot, which isn't even worth repeating, unfolds. Granted, it's
intended to be a very silly comedy, and that's what it is; just not a funny
one. Mercifully the running time is brief. If you laugh at it, consider a
career as a model.
