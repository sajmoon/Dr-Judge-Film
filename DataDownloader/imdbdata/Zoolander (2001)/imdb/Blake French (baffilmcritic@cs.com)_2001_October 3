ZOOLANDER / (2001) ** (out of four)<br /><br />The first thing I do after watching a movie is evaluate any personal
changes
it made with me. A film can completely change my outlook on parts of life.
Zoolander did indeed make a lasting impression.on my view of male super
models. I can honestly say I'll never look at another Calvin Klien
billboard
the same way again, but that isn't exactly a towering accomplishment.<br /><br />Zoolander is not supposed to make a lasting impression; it's flimsy,
90-minute escapism. Though I didn't laugh very much in this nonsensical
comedy either, although it does contain some funny material involving the
title character's stupidity, and it benefits from keeping its tongue
firmly
in cheek.<br /><br />Following the success of his blockbuster comedies &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and
&quot;There's Something About Mary,&quot; Ben Stiller gathered family and friends to
make Zoolander, an original, stylish satire on the fashion industry. Based
on a 1996 VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards character Stiller co-created with MTV
Movie Awards writer/producer Drake Sather, Zoolander is quite pleased with
its unique sense of humor, but unique does not necessarily spell
funny.<br /><br />Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, who has defended his title of Male Model of
the Year for three consecutive years now, but this year his competition
gets
the best of him. A dashing, red-hot newcomer, Hansel (Owen Wilson) nabs
the
award, sending Zoolander home with nothing but a low self-image. Shocked
by
these and other tragic events, Derek wonders if there's more to life than
being &quot;really, really good looking.&quot; He returns to his Southern roots only
for his coal miner father (Jon Voight) to disown him. Enter a diabolical
plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, and you have yourself
the visually amusing concept of Zoolander.<br /><br />Ben Stiller has the stuff here, as does Owen Wilson, Jon Voight, SNL
veteran
Will Ferrell, Jerry Stiller, and Milla Jovovich. I especially enjoyed the
charismatic performance by Ben Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor
as
an aggressive Time Magazine Reporter. Andy Dick, Fabio, Cuba Gooding Jr.,
Donald Trump, Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Billy Zane, and Garry
Shandling
and other big stars appear for satiric cameos. There's a lot of talent
involved with this film, which makes it all the more tragic that it
doesn't
work.<br /><br />Ben Stiller, who also directs, writes, and producers this movie, has a lot
of fun. During pre-production, Stiller and Owen Wilson spent two days
being
photographed by Frank Ockenfels to create model
&quot;portfolios&quot; for Zoolander and Hansel. They posed in mock ad campaigns for
Gucci, Perry Ellis, Tommy Hilfiger and Evian, as well as bogus magazine
covers for GQ, Details, Rolling Stone, Surfer, American Way, ESPN and the
International Male catalog.<br /><br />Filmed in New York City and Los Angeles, the film creates an enjoyable
world
of glamorous fashion fiction. Production designer Robin Standefer and
costume designer David C. Robinson imagine lush, outrageous, exotic
costumes
and images that greatly contribute to character development. Even with
such
a complex visual arena, however, Zoolander flops. It's visually
entertaining, yes, but the story is not interesting, the characters
one-dimensional, and the attempt at humor only occasionally makes us
grimace. It's dazzling, flavorful candy for our eyes, but Zoolander is all
style without substance.<br /><br />
