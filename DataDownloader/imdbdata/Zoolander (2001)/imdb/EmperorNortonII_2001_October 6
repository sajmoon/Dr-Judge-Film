I found &quot;Zoolander&quot; very funny.  It's also clever in it's silly way.  Ben
Stiller plays Derek Zoolander as a monumentally stupid male model.  What can
you say about a man who pours so much energy into perfecting facial
expressions that more or less all look the same?  And Will Ferrell does a
good job as Mugatu, the outrageous villain.  The best scene is the
&quot;walk-off&quot; between Derek and Hansel, which is probably the funniest duel in
movies today.  The whole thing was a flamboyant and hilarious turn on the
catwalk!
