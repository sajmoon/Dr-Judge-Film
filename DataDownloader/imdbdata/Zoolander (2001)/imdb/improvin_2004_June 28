I absolutely loved this movie. Yes it was a bit out of whack and crazy,
but it was truly hilarious. Ben Stiller is a great comedic actor, and I
think this movie compliments his acting skills. The characters are
great, the lines are great, and the idea is creative and great. Will
Ferrell also did an amazing job with his character. Making him funny,
but at the same time evil can sometimes be difficult. Difficulty didn't
stop him in creating his character. Owen Wilson is no exception. His
character had power as well. The storyline was a bit weird, but that's
alright by me! I'm crazy about this movie, even if it was one of the
most random ones that I've ever seen.
