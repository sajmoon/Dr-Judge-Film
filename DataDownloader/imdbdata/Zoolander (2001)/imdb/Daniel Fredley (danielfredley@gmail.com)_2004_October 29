I'm actually embarrassed to have seen this movie. About the only
&quot;positive&quot;<br /><br />thing about the movie was the fact that they intertwined inside jokes
for movie buffs such as the 2001 reference and such. Also the
appearance of David<br /><br />Bowie was cool, but this is by far the dumbest movie I have ever seen.
It was full of offensive humor. The story line was dumb. The fact that
his friends get killed in a gasoline explosion--and the whole fashion
thing. Dumb. Dumb. <br /><br />Dumb. At least Legally Blonde went somewhere with the fashion thing.
Don't<br /><br />waste your time.
