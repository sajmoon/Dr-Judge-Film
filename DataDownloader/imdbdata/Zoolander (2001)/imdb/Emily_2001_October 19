This was 1 of those movies were I was hoping it would be good, and wanted
to
come out of theater saying &quot;WOW that was great!&quot; but the smile just didn't
come to my face. Zoolander wasn't much better than it looked like the
trailers.. An interesting plot, and mostly no product placements, unlike
the
ridiculous Josie and the Pussy cats. Zoolander was funny sometimes, but
Ben's &quot;look&quot; got old pretty quick. The moral of the movie, which there is
in
every movie, was deep, yet had it been delivered in a different way, it
would have been more convincing and, the lazy humor wouldn't have been so
painful and disappointing, or wouldn't have SEEMED that way, had the
producers ELABORATED upon that moral a little more. Then, I would have
been
more impressed. Please, spare me the bluish-gray lipstick thing and use
that
silent, jokes-fallen-flat-second a little wiser.
