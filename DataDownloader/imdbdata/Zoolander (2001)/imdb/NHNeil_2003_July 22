2003_July 22 

This movie is the biggest piece of trash that I have seen in a number of
years. Somebody actually made this movie, thought it was funny and put it
out there for the public to view. I sometimes wonder what people are
thinking when they produce a pile of crap such as this. Watched the
entire
movie as I wanted to see if I would laugh or crack a smile at least once.
An
hour-and-a-half later I sat stone faced with a feeling of relief that
this
atrocity had ended.
