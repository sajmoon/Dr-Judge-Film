This is a good movie for those who have a sense of humor.  It makes fun of
models.  The characters are great.  Ben Stiller's character, Derek
Zoolander, is full of himself.  He's the biggest name in the modeling world,
and he knows it.  He wears all white and gives a press conference/eulogy at
a funeral, and he competes against another model in a &quot;walk off.&quot;   Will
Ferrell from Saturday Night Live plays a bad guy named Mugatu.  Mugatu has
funny hair, dresses like he's from another planet, and behaves as if he's
out of his mind.  Best of all is a character named Hansel McDonald, who's
played by Owen Wilson.  This guy rides around on a fold-up scooter.  When
he's not riding, he carries it around on his back.  To ride, he takes it off
his back like Robin Hood would an arrow, and he quickly unfolds it like a
pro.  Some of his lines are hilarious.  He shares his pad with some pretty
exotic people.  This film is loaded with cameo appearances.
