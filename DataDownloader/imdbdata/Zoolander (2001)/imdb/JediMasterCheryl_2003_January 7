2003_January 7 
I laughed my rear off at this movie in the theater and absolutely had
to own it on video (and now DVD!). Aw, c&#39;mon people, where is your
sense of irreverence? Ben is a comic genius (it&#39;s in his blood) and too
many folks try to pick apart his movies because he is &quot;quirky&quot; and
operates on a different mental level than most others in his comedic
writing/directing style. I hope that Ben continues to make, star in and
direct movies HIS way - because the talent is obvious to those who see
beyond traditional &quot;comedic acting&quot; and understand his zany sense of
humor. Duchovny&#39;s part was genius! Owen Wilson - hilarious! And as for
slamming Will Farrel - get a life ! How silly and funny is he in this
movie? Look at his hairdo! The whole movie is supposed to PARODY the
world of fashion modeling - I am just sorry for those of you who &quot;Don&#39;t
quite get it&quot;.
