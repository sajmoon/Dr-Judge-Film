Ok, Zoolander and Corky Romano came out around the same time. I thought
both
of them looked funny, so when Zoolander came out, I went to see it. It was
funny, stupid funny yes, but funny, and it was something different. Then
when Corky Romano came out, I went to see that too. I was REALLY
disapointed, i thought it would be MUCH funnier. The thing was, how many
movies has there been about a total clutz that messes up all the time, but
people just mistake that for his genius? The jokes were a lot funnier in
the
commercials, but all together... I just wasn't laughing. Then a couple days
later at school, people were talking about hilarious it was (these are 13
year olds) and i just wanted to smack them around and say,&quot;WAKE UP!!!&quot; Dont
get me wrong, Zoolander wasn't the best movie ever made, but Corky Romano?
Please...
Zoolander 5/5*'s (because i like ben stiller)
Corky Romano: 1/5 *'s
