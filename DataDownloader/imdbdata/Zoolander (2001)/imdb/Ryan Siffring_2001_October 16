This movie cannot be compared to other movies in the normal sense.
Comedies
just don't get high ratings.  The rating for this movie is truly under
rated.  This movie if compared on a scale of 10 for comedy would
deservingly
be an 8.  It makes clever jokes, intelligent jokes, and dumb jokes,
something for everybody and a social comment about beauty in todays world
as
seen by a supermodel.  So if you are under the age of 40, you will
thoroughly enjoy the movie, and isn't that what it is about.  It may be
dumb, but it is enjoyable and worth the money for the movie
ticket
