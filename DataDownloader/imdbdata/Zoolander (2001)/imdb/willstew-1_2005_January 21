This movie is definitely worth renting, no questions asked. Some people
will love this movie; they'll buy this movie and watch it over and over
again and find it funny every single time. If you like Ben Stiller,
Owen Wilson, and/or Will Ferrell; Dodgeball, Super Troopers, Austin
Powers, Monty Python, The Royal Tenenbaums, Old School, or Napoleon
Dynamite-then you should at least rent this movie.<br /><br />Personally, I love this movie. It is probably one of the funniest
movies of all time. If you find the sheer stupidity of some people,
this movie is for you. This movie is all about surprising you, the
audience, with how incredibly stupid, vain, and far from reality these
male models can be, and to back it up there are tons of cameo
appearances by models and other celebrities.
