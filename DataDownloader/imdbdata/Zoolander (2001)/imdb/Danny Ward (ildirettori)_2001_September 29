Zoolander offers both the classic, slapstick, &quot;dumb&quot; humor, along
with presenting an array of intelligent humor. It brings to the screen
references from other films, literature, and pop culture.  <br /><br />Stiller brought in actors, models, singers, and other celebrities
ranging from Billy Zaine to David Bowie.  Many of the celebs that
make cameos in this comedy utter not a spoken word, such as
Vince Vaughn, who simply stands behind Jon Voight.<br /><br />Stiller's great writing fails only in comparison to his brilliant
incorporation of other films - 2001: A Space Odyssey, Manchurian
Candidate, and many others...<br /><br />The over-the-top acting of Stiller and Wilson was the perfect
stylistic choice for the film.  The on camera chemistry between the
two has long been missed on the silver screen.
