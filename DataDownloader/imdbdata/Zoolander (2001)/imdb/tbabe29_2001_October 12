I checked my watch. Then I laughed. I checked other people looking at their
watches. Then I laughed again.<br /><br />What can I say. This movie is slower and thinner than I hoped. There is more
posing than actual funny dialogue. You can only mug the camera so many
times.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I did laugh. Just not as much as I hoped I
would.<br /><br />And what the heck is Ben Stiller's dad doing in this movie? (That IS his
dad, isn't it?) He is way too blue-collar for the role of a model's agent. 
He could have played the agent's janitor. That would have been funnier.<br /><br />Oh well.<br /><br />
