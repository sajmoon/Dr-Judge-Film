Zoolander was honestly one of the funniest movies I have ever 
seen.  I cannot account for the fact that the guy who wrote the
summary didn't laugh!!  That was hilarious, sure the movie did not
expose the world of male modeling or anything but it didn't set out
to do that.  So it shouldn't be judged for things it did not set out to
accomplish.  It should be admired for what it was able to do, make
everyone laugh and tell a good and entertaining story.  Good
stories were very hard to come by this season, can we say Planet
of the Apes and The Mummy Returns?.
