Ben Stiller is laugh out loud hilarious in &quot;Zoolander&quot;. Its a story about a
male model, when he fails to win the &quot;Male Model of the Year&quot; award for the
forth straight time, he ventures out to find out who he is. The winner of
the award, Hansel (Owen Wilson), starts to become extremely famous, while
Derek Zoolander, is becoming a nothing. When Magatu (Will Ferrell),
discovers how stupid Derek is, he brainwashes him to kill the Prime Minister
of Malaysia. <br /><br />There are many parts that make you laugh so hard your about to cry. One for
example, when Derek's friends are fighting Derek yells &quot;Stop it!&quot; &quot; Don't
you think there is more to life than being really, really, really
ridicuolusly good looking. I mean, maybe we should do something more
meaningful with our lives, like helping people&quot; His friend replies &quot;Uh,
Derek, what people?&quot; Derek then throws up his hands in disguist saying, &quot;I
don't know, people who need help!&quot; This is one of the many laugh out loud
lines in this movie. Another one, when his friends die in a freak gasoline
fight accident, Derek gives a speech at their funeral, his starting line is
&quot;Brint, Meekus, and Prince were like brothers to me. And when I say brother,
I don't mean like an actual brother, but I mean it in the way black people
use it, it's just more meaningful I think&quot; The funniest scene in this movie
is the &quot;Walkoff&quot; scene, when Hansel and Derek go head to head in a walkoff.<br /><br />There are many star cameos in this movie, such as Wionna Ryder, David
Duchovney, Natalie Portman, and Cuba Gooding Jr. The whole Stiller family is
in this movie as well. Ben Stiller's dad, Jerry Stiller, plays his good
friend and proud owner of &quot;Ball's Models&quot;, Morrie Ballsteen. Also, you can
spot Ben Stiller's mother as the woman throwing an egg at Magatu in the
third scene.<br /><br />This movie is a must see. Each scene has atleast five laugh out loud laughs
and the fun never stops. If you read Roger Ebert's review on this movie,
don't trust him, he is definetely 100% wrong. I saw &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; a week ago.
I liked it, but Ben Stiller is ten times as funny as Adam Sandler could ever
be. This movie is non-stop fun, you must see it. Now I usually don't give
many movies, especially comedies, four stars but &quot;Zoolander&quot; deserves it. A
blast!<br /><br />**** out of **** <br /><br />
