This is such a weird movie I couldn&#39;t understand a word of it. It is
too confusing and the plot makes no sense. All the actors keep saying
all these different things to one another but it&#39;s too hard to make any
sense of it. There&#39;s a lot of talking.<br /><br />The film is all about two models (who are men) and that is all I
understood. The rest was weird. The actors all looked unhappy as if
they had been forced to be in the movie, and the main character looks
like he has ants in his pants. At times I thought this movie was going
to demand a revenge from me! LOL.<br /><br />If you see this film it will be a mistake and a waste of time. You will
not like it at all. The movie was so bad it made me want to run a brush
across my knees.
