Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller)is the dumbest male model around. He has just
failed to win &quot;male model of the year&quot; for the 4th straight year and is
picked as the perfect one to be brainwashed into assassinating the Prime
Minister of Malaysia who will be a guest at the big show in 14
days.<br /><br />This is a Ben Stiller movie. Star, director, probably had a hand in writing
and producing. There are many genuinely funny parts in this film. However
all put together it doesn't quite work as a movie. I enjoyed it, but as an
attempt at a good, silly parody of the fashion industry, it falls flat.
Perhaps the most interesting feature is all the cameos -- his mom and dad,
and a whole host of famous people playing themselves, mainly in very short
&quot;interviews&quot; where they explain their high regard for Derek
Zoolander.<br /><br />The DVD is good, some of the outtakes and some of the deleted scenes are
interesting.  Not one to own, just a quick viewing and return to the rental
store.
