2001_December 1 

Having seen the trailer and thought 'doesn't look very good', I decided to
see it anyway since I have a membership that enables me to see as many
films
as I want.<br /><br />The film totally surpassed my expectations. Having recently decided that
Jeepers Creepers and The Animal were two of the worst films I've ever seen
I
was completely unprepared for  what I was about to see. This is now only
second to Showgirls for The Worst Movie Ever Made.<br /><br />How is it possible for the man who was hilarious in a five minute
appearance
in Friends and equally brilliant in There's Something About Mary, Mystery
Men and Meet The Parents take a giant step backwards create such a
disastrously bad film? It failed to even raise a faint smile on my face for
the entire 90 minutes.<br /><br />What I can't believe are the ones who have given it good ratings. Are they
mad? They're probably the same people who think Showgirls is a brilliant
American satire. I was surrounding by people laughing out loud and (this is
no lie) applauding some of the jokes. I'm disappointed that it's not
possible to give a lower rating than 1.<br /><br />Easily the worst film I've seen in a cinema (I saw Showgirls on TV). Even
though I didn't pay to see it, I still demanded my money back at the end.
Don't watch it. Ever. You'll thank me in the end.<br /><br />By the way, I thought The Cable Guy was very funny.<br /><br />I still can't believe they were applauding...
