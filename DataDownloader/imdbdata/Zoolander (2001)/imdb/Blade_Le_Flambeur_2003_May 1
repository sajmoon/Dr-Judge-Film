Many people butchered this film for it's &quot;stupidity&quot;. What is stupidity
in
films? For me, it's lack of proper filmaking. Bad script, terrible
direction, etc. However, in this case people are probably refering to the
jokes made. This film is rather well- made. Ben Stiller doesn't know much
about filmaking but he does a solid job as a director and an excellent
job
as a writer. This film can also be viewed from a satire point of view as
displaying the downright absurdity of male modeling. There is actual
acting
required to do this film. Acting like a moron, a genius, whatever, acting
is
acting. Ben Stiller leads this comically stellar class with a refined
performance as Derek Zoolander, who may be a bit of an idiot but he still
has a heart. Will Ferell provides excellent support as the evil Mugatu,
whose plans are somewhat baffling yet make sense. Also noteworthy is Owen
Wilson, who I found to do the least best job of acting, he was a bit too
over- the- top in his character's sillyness. The music is very cool 80's
style with some great songs like &quot;Call Me&quot; and &quot;Everyone's Working for
the
Weekend&quot;. Sure, this film may not go down in history as one of the best
films ever made. Yes, some of the jokes fall flat, Ben Stiller's
direction
isn't amazing, but this film is still an entertaining experience. Not for
those looking for a deep film, but it's still enjoyable.
9/10
