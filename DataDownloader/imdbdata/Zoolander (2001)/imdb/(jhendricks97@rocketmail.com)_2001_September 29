Ben Stiller created the `Derek Zoolander' character for a five
minute
sketch on the VH1 Fashion Awards.  The antics of the incredibly
stupid
male model was a big hit, and so they decided to greenlight a
full
length movie about the character.  But the producer's overlooked
one
thing.  Derek Zoolander is a one-joke character.  And so its
no
surprise that the full length movie built around him falls
flatter
than a bad perm.<br /><br />I was amazed by how few laughs this movie had.  And the few jokes
that
were in `Zoolander,' have already been revealed in the trailer! 
Now
`Zoolander' does have its moments, the celebrity cameos for
example,
are funny.  But they are the exception.  So if someone asks you to
go
see `Zoolander,' runway.  I mean, run away!  2 stars out of 5. <br /><br />
