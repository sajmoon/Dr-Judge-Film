I saw this movie today and thought it was HILARIOUS!  Ben Stiller is a 100%
genius!<br /><br />For anyone still shaken over the recent events in New York City, this is
definitely a HIGH reccomendation to get your mind off of it for about an
hour and half.  This movie is exactly what people need to see at a time
like
this.<br /><br />The only part that might be a little strange to watch is the 2 parts at
which you can view the twin towers.  But other than that, this is a
must-see!
