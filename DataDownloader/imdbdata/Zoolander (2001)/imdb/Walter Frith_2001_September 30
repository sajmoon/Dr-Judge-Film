2001_September 30 

Ben Stiller horrified me with this indefensible piece of trash.  Comedy
that's not smart or witty, just insulting to the intelligence.  Treating
those in the fashion industry like they're aliens from another planet.  Even
though some might be, this movie over did it.  A lopsided climax that was as
convincing as believing the colour black exists in the rainbow.  Shameless
product placements at every turn anger audiences who don't want to watch one
giant commercial.  Christine Taylor's character seemed totally out of place
even though I wanted her in every scene but her sense of being normal in an
abnormal film like this on the opposite side was like finding Bozo the clown
in Hamlet.  Owen Wilson, Jerry Stiller and Will Ferrell embarrassed
themselves and this movie was just annoying and embarrassing to watch and
got on my nerves after about the first 15 minutes.  What a waste of talent
and time.  2001 has been the worst year for movies ever!
