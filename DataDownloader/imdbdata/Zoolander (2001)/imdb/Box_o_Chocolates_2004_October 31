Dude, I can't believe it! Dumb and Dumber got a better score. I'm
sickened.<br /><br />heh, but I shouldn't be all worked up about it. There's something about
Mugatu that keeps me laughing the entire movie. And the jokes aren't so
incredibly lame like in &quot;D and D&quot; Yes, the humor is stupid, but not
RETARDED. :( Ben Stiller did a nice job, I think. <br /><br />I mean, who doesn't laugh at the &quot;Merman...*cough cough* MERMAN!&quot; part?
:P ...maybe I just like overly dramatic scenes. Man, I'm a really picky
movie-critic, and I really loved this movie. And I love the classics
like Holy Grail and Young Frankenstein. Go figure. People are diverse.<br /><br />I give this a 9.7/10 (.3 is for the moments that were just too stupid
for me..but honestly, there weren't many)
