Zoolander (2001, Dir. Ben Stiller) <br /><br />Derek Zoolander is VH1&#39;s three time male model of the year, but when
Hansel wins the award instead, Zoolander&#39;s world becomes upside down.
His friends disappear, his father is disappointed in him, and he feels
that he&#39;s not good as a model anymore. But when evil fashion guru
Mugato hires Zoolander, he thinks his life has turned back round again,
that is until he finds out that Mugato has actually brainwashed him to
kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Can Zoolander and his new friends
find out how to prevent the incident, before it&#39;s too late? <br /><br />Ben Stiller has done fairly well with the movies in which he has
directed or produced, so you should know what to expect. The movie
contains a well written script. It has a few sexual references but do
not go over the top. The jokes are hilarious and the choreography is
incredible. The list of cast is huge, with amazing performances by
stars such as Will Ferrell and Jon Voight, mixed with interesting
cameos by the likes of Paris Hilton and Billy Zane. It&#39;s not the best
comedy out there, but definitely one which everyone would enjoy.<br /><br />&quot;You freakin&#39; idiot!&quot; - J.P. Prewitt (David Duchovny)
