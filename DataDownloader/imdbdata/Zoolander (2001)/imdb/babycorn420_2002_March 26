i really went into this movie with an open mind, realizing it was a satire
on the fashion industry. and i thought it would be fairly humorous because
of stiller and owens. boy, was i wrong. this movie was awful. i like stupid
movies, i can laugh at them. by the end of the movie, the only thing i was
impressed with was how ben stiller kept that voice and face up the whole
time.... this movie really began to hurt my head after a while
