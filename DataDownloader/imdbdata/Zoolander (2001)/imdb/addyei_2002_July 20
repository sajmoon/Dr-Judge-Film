By far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Good quality
humor
is hard to come across these days (or D-E-A-Y-E-S as Derek Zoolander would
put it) and films like this one are simply godsend.  Don't expect &quot;Meet
the
parents&quot; or &quot;There's someting about Mary&quot;.  Zoolander goes waaay beyond
those in stupidity and yet it manages to be every bit as funny.  If you
haven't seen it yet, don't rent it expecting anything. Just watch it and
enjoy it on its own terms.
