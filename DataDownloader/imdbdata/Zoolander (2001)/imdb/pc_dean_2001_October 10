&quot;Zoolander&quot; puts forth the notion that male models, and Fashion People in
general, are shallow, self-obsessed, and sneeringly unaware of their own
ridiculousness, and also that the bulk of international intrigue and
diabolical scheming can be traced directly to the fashion industry.  While
this makes it plausible to argue that it is in fact a documentary, it is
actually proof that Ben Stiller is one of the best satirists working in
movies today.  Okay, so it's a narrow field; but he is still a funny,
funny
guy, especially when you eliminate the Farrelly brothers, who would be
lost
without their casting director.<br /><br />Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is a famed male model, a man so shallow that
he's
actually convex.  Crushed at being eclipsed by a younger rival, he is
recruited into a shadowy plot to become a brainwashed assassin for the
international clothes cartel.  It's kind of like &quot;The Manchurian
Candidate&quot;
as imagined by Details magazine.<br /><br />Naturally, much is made of Derek's dimness, and that of male models in
general.  Though much of it is funny, it does wear thin after a while.
The
movie is a lot funnier when instead of mocking fashion types as empty
heads,
it aims at the conventions of the industry itself, as in a scene where
Derek
and his fabulously-dressed buddies' magazine-spread romp at a gas station
spins hilariously out of control, or a &quot;Bloodsport&quot; style confrontation
between rival models &quot;at the old Members Only warehouse&quot;.  The best gag in
the movie concerns the concept behind a new fashion line, which is at once
screamingly funny and scathingly true.  The numerous movie references are
also well-brought off, and it is great fun to see familiar spy-movie
conventions transplanted to the world of style, as in a meeting of
faceless
international villains of fashion (&quot;I trust you want to live to see your
spring line.&quot;)  The brainwashing takes place in a special &quot;day spa&quot;
overseen
by a Rosa Klebb-style dominatrix (Milla Jovovich) and her impeccably-clad
goon squad who are always perfectly posed, even when tossing intruders out
the steel doors.<br /><br />The cameos by notable real-life Beautiful People are a tad excessive, and
lend &quot;Zoolander&quot; an in-jokey quality that it doesn't need, and dulls the
edge on the sendup until the darts are more like Nerf arrows.
Fortunately,
most of the cameos are too fast to count, and they often do little more
than
walk by the camera (the movie often feels an annoying urge to name-drop
and
flash labels on the screen, lest you miss a card-carrying glitterati).  An
exception is David Bowie's funny turn as a kind of haute-couture Mills
Lane.
But the central cast is the real show here.  Stiller's evocation of
Zoolander's patented &quot;looks&quot; are hysterical. Owen Wilson's blank stare,
misshapen nose, and ludicrous New Age claptrap make him a great foil as
Hansel, Zoolander's scooter-slinging upstart rival.  David Duchovny does a
great parody of his &quot;X-Files&quot; persona, just as he did in &quot;Evolution&quot; (I
get
a feeling this will be the arc of Duchovny's future career, at least until
he gets a better agent).  Christine Taylor also makes a fine straight man
as
a reporter covering the Zoolander beat.  However, Will Ferrell does his
level best to steal the show as Mugatu, a crazed designer, who plots
political murder without batting an eye, but gets all hissy when there's
too
much foam in his latte.<br /><br />Oddly, &quot;Zoolander&quot; is helped somewhat by the ineptness of its trailers,
which for some reason chose the more lackluster jokes to showcase, the
ones
that display Stiller's weakness as a writer and director: he is too often
shy about trusting the audience to get a joke, and feels a need to
over-explain or over-stage a gag until it ceases to be funny.  This
instinct
has hamstrung more than a few dynamite jokes in his career, and he needs
to
muzzle it.  Some of the funniest gags in &quot;Zoolander&quot; are the ones we see
in
brief, subtle passing, not the ones that have giant neon arrows reading
&quot;Comic Moment&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Zoolander&quot; may or may not be more amusing to those who are hip to the
world
of fashion.  I frankly wouldn't know.  But even those of us who couldn't
pick Donna Karan out of a police lineup or wouldn't know a Manolo Blahnik
if
it kicked us square in the face, can appreciate the satiric skewering of
those who do.  Even more, perhaps.<br /><br />There is, at the end, an unintentionally sad note to the comedy.  In the
final credits, the movie gives special thanks to the Explosives Unit of
the
New York Fire Department.  God bless them every one.
