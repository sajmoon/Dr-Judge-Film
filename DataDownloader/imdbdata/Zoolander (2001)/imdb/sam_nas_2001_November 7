Ok, what can I say...  I just saw Zoolander with a friend and I thought that
the movie was HORRIBLE.  The thing is my friend enjoyed it.  So what does
this mean?  It means that if you think EXTREME STUPIDITY is funny then go
see it, otherwise stay away.  Also, the actor didn't look like a male model
which made the movie even less believable (like if that is possible! LOL). 
Anyways, to me the movie wasn't funny at all and I don't understand how
someone could find it funny.  But just like I said, my friend liked it so I
guess it depends on the person.  I remember that I didn't find the trailer
funny, so that could be a hint.  If you enjoyed the trailer go see it, if
you didn't find the trailer interesting then stay away.  Also, the movie
hurts the reputation of male models.  I'm sure they are normal intelligent
people and it's sad that they are portrayed and seen like this in
general.
