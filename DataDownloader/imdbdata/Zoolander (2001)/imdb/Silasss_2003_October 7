2003_October 7 

For some reason, because Derek Zoolander, Hansel and the other male models
are characterised as being people of very little brain, the whole movie has
been characterised as &quot;mindless humour&quot; or &quot;stupidity humour&quot; or &quot;teenage
fratboy humour&quot;.  Well, I'm sorry but I just don't see it.  I do, however,
see a witty, sharply written and very funny movie so jam packed with visual
jokes that you don't dare take your eyes off the screen.  (I liked for
example the calendar in which Zoolander demonstrated his
&quot;versatility&quot;.)<br /><br />Wilson plays Hansel very well but Stiller as Zoolander is absolutely pitch
perfect, with not a single facial muscle out of place for the maximal comic
effect.<br /><br />In fact it's less a satire on the fashion industry than it is a satire of
high concept movies.  Apart from the obvious hommage to 2001: A Space
Odyssey at one point, certain elements are included so you can laugh about
how they would appear an a serious film - such as Jon Voight cheering his
son on as he watches him on TV.  Some great cameos, some of them you are
surprised don't take themselves as seriously as you think.  (Winona Ryder
talking to Zoolander about what it's like to make a complete fool of
yourself in public was just, well, weird, in retrospect.)<br /><br />One of the very few films nowadays not to outstay its welcome, at less than
ninety minutes it does what it has to do and then gets
out.<br /><br />A superb soundtrack adds to the atmosphere.
