The reviews of &quot;Zoolander&quot; have tended to say one of two things:<br /><br />&quot;it's stupid&quot;, or &quot;it's stupid fun&quot;. Briefly speaking, I'd choose the<br /><br />latter option, but there's more to it than that.<br /><br />What makes &quot;Zoolander&quot; such an entertaining movie is not simply<br /><br />the ridiculous plot and script; on paper, sometimes it's just too silly<br /><br />and sometimes it doesn't work.<br /><br />It's the realisation of the basic idea that makes it effective. The<br /><br />acting is very strong, the direction creates just the right mood, and<br /><br />the production design is really excellent. The story, such as it is, is<br /><br />excellently paced, and the movie flies by.<br /><br />You really get the impression that thought and care went into<br /><br />perfecting the stupidity.
