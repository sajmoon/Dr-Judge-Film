Actually, dumb n dumber actually made me laugh.  This movie is so stupid I
doubt you'll hardly even chuckle as I did.  I love ben stiller and will
farrell, but this movie was just poorly written.  Let's make the 2 main
characters as stupid as possible with jokes that are for a 5 year old, and
then we'll stick in a bunch of 80's retro to make it seem like a fun
movie,
yet if you strip that away you realize how empty it is &quot;Oh, but there's a
remix of relax by powerman 5000, isn't that worth seeing it alone?&quot;  About
the only cool thing about the DVD is the fact that the menus are silly,
and
there's tons of extended scenes and outtakes.  Other than that, this movie
falls way short of being enjoyable.
