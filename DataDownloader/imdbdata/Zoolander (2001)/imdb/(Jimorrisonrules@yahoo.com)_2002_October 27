2002_October 27 

I would be lying if I said that this was the dumbest movie that I have
ever
seen, because I didn't even watch the rest of if it, the first 15 minutes
was enough for me to leave the room. This is one of those horrible new
movies that I hate such as Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, The New Guy,
and
Kung Pow.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie was the hott chick that was in it.
Other than that do not rent this movie.
