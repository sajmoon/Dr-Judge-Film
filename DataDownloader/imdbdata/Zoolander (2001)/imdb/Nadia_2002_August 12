This is one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in a long time.  It will
keep you laughing throughout and there is not a single dull moment.  Besides
that, it has HUGE guest cast, with someone popping in every now and then
which makes it all the more enjoyable.  <br /><br />Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have done an excellent job.  They're expressions
were absolutely fantastic.  <br /><br />Highly recommended if you're looking for a good laugh.
