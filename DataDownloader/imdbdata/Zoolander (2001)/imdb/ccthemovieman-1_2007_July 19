This has to be a movie that people would either laugh their butt off
watching, or turn it off and never finishing it because it was so
stupid. Fortunately, as someone who loves absurd humor, I was
entertained by it. Yes, it&#39;s one of the dumbest films you&#39;ll ever see,
but it&#39;s supposed to be stupid, a satire on the shallow people and
world of male fashion models.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is outstanding as &quot;Derek Zoolander,&quot; the brainless model
who&#39;s number one male model status is upended by newcomer &quot;Hansel,&quot;
played by Owen Wilson. In light of Wilson&#39;s recent real-life drug
problems, I couldn&#39;t help but think &quot;how can these actors play absurd
roles like this and be normal?&quot; It&#39;s almost understandable by so many
in the film business are whacked! You have to hand it to them, though:
Stiller, Wilson, Millo Jovovich and Will Ferrell are good at playing
weird people, as they do here. But it&#39;s all in fun - plus a serious
comment about child labor - and the movie is simply to be enjoyed for
what it is. Of course, it&#39;s stupid overall, but it&#39;s a spoof, like the
Austin Powers films.<br /><br />Film fans and celebrity geeks will enjoy all the cameos in here, along
with the wild outfits - male and female - and all the goofy looks on
the faces, mainly Stiller&#39;s poses. In between all the dumbness is some
smart satire on several topics dealing with the fashion business. Just
know what you are getting into here, and you should get enough laughs
to make it an entertaining hour-and-a-half.
