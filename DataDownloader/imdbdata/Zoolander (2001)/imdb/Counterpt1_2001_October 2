I didn't expect much out of this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. 
The humor is very, very dumb, for the most part, but still quite funny
(kind of in the Dumb and Dumber vein of humor, as Stiller's
character is a complete imbecile). I would definitely recommend
this as a light, fun comedy. Don't expect cerebral humor, but you
will be entertained. 
7/10
