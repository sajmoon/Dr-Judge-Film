So the only reason I watched this film was because my dad thought it
would be really funny, and he rented it, and I thought &quot;What the heck,
I love movies, might as well watch it.&quot; Of course I didn&#39;t expect much;
in fact, I expected very little.<br /><br />The movie wasn&#39;t worse than I expected. But it definitely wasn&#39;t any
better, either. This is a storyline--about a male model brainwashed to
assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia--completely out of touch
with reality. It was hard to pick out any real-life emotion in this
thing, and what little was there was obscured by the over-attempts at
slapstick and comedy, patched together only passably by director Ben
Stiller.<br /><br />What about the comedy? As I said, it tries too hard most of the time.
But there are some good lines and some really laugh-out-loud moments.
What I liked most of all, however, were the moments of extremely
irreverent humor (though perhaps the joke involving Abe Lincoln and JFK
was going too far). I just like that sort of thing, and if you like it,
then you might find something in this movie.<br /><br />My dad loved this movie about 100%. But he&#39;s like that. He prefers
movies that ARE out-of-touch with reality, that have lots of slapstick
humor, and that don&#39;t really tap human emotions. He&#39;ll sit through a
bunch of immaturity to experience complete escapism. If you fit that
description, then you will like this movie, too. In fact, I&#39;ll go as
far as to suggest you watch it.
