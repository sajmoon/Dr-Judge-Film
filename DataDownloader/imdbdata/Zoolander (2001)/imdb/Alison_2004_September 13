The first time I watched Zoolander, I was a little immature. So I did
not like it. Zoolander is not a movie for the immature. It is a movie
for people with a wonderful sense of humor and a great knowledge of
current events. It is for those who like stupid humor, however you have
to be pretty witty to understand many of the jokes. <br /><br />A few months ago, and a few years after seeing it for the first time, I
watched Zoolander again. And I was stumped as to how I did not enjoy it
the first time I watched it. I do not think that I have ever watched a
movie where I have laughed throughout the entire film, and Zoolander
did this to me. There are so many hidden jokes, and it is absolutely
hilarious. My stomache hurt from laughter while I was watching it. And
even though I have seen the movie about a million times more, I still
laugh just as hard every time. <br /><br />Everyone in my school quotes Zoolander. I have never met anyone that is
smart and witty that has said that Zoolander is a bad movie. It is a
new culture! Zoolander will truly become a piece of cinematic history. <br /><br />The acting is wonderful and the actors were chosen brilliantly. No one
could have made a better stupid male model than Ben Stiller. And his
long time movie partner, Owen Wilson, made the movie perfect.<br /><br />The movie is so wonderful and I recommend it to anyone who has a good
sense of humor, otherwise, do not watch it, because you will think it
is lame.
