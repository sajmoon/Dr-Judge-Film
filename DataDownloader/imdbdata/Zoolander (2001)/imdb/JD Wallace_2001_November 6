2001_November 6 

I am not sure just what I expected, but when I left the theater, the only
thing I got for sure was Pepsi and popcorn! The rest is just a maelstrom of
very weird, very stilted comedy that was served by some very talented, but
misguided (or misdirected)actors. If you want mindless humor, try Sandler.
If you want mindful humor try Stiller in ANYTHING BUT THIS! Good comedians,
like Carrey, Martin, and Stiller should be allowed a couple of wrong
turns...but Ben, this is YOU in James Dean's car that fateful night.
NEVER-EVER do a script like this again. What did your Dad say? He has comic
sense and timing...and I can't believe he did not advise against
this...well, yeah I guess he could; after all he's your dad. Other than your
'patented poses' the film was sad. Sorry, I expected more...and I know you
can do it.
