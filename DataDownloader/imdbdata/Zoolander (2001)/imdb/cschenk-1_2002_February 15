Zoolander is honestly one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long
long
time.  Yes it is stupid, pointless and at times crude, but the quality and
depth it is produced with makes these negative qualities into good ones.
The writing was wonderful--full of those great little nuggets of
comedy--and
Zoolander is one of the most quoteable movies I have ever seen!  People
pan
this movie for being stupid--that it is &quot;made by idiots, for idiots.&quot;
Zoolander is a clever and refreshing comedy.  I love the fact that there
is
a model named Hansel--I mean, that is hilarious!!  And then Will Ferrel's
Mugatu was just fantastic (but then when is Ferrel anything other than
hilarious).  I think that anyone who wants to see this movie needs to give
it a solid chance--you'll probably love it!
&quot;I'm sorry, did my pin get in the way of your a**?  Do me a favor and lose
five pounds immediately or get out of my building like
now!!&quot;
