Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a slow-witted fashion model who is
known for his &#x27;Blue Steel&#x27; look, and has dominated the industry for
years. When the new kid on the block, Hansel (Owen Wilson), starts
taking the attention away from Zoolander, and journalist Matilda
(Stiller&#x27;s wife Christine Taylor) writes a mocking piece on him,
Zoolander considers retirement. He travels back home to work in the
coal pits with his father (Jon Voight) and brothers (Vince Vaughn and
Judah Friedlander) but they reject him due to his fashion antics and
general uselessness in the pits. Meanwhile, fashion giant Jacobim
Mugatu (Will Ferrell) is coming up with a plan to assassinate the Prime
Minister of Malaysia, and feels that Zoolander is just stupid enough to
be the hit- man.<br /><br />I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of the work of Stiller and his usual
troupe. While his films are generally entertaining, I just don&#x27;t find
them that funny. Zoolander, though not exactly a classic, is possibly
his best, being frequently funny, silly, and most important of all,
fun. For all it&#x27;s prat-falls and ridiculous costumes, it is actually a
pretty damn accurate send-up of the fashion industry. Many a time I&#x27;ve
been forced to sit through the likes of America&#x27;s Next Top Model and
whatever new s**t Gok Wan has come up with (I detest that man with
every fabric of my being), and it is really this ridiculous.<br /><br />The cleverist moment of the film is when Mugatu announces his new
fashion show, called Derelicte, spinning fashion out of the bums and
hobo&#x27;s that roam the streets. It&#x27;s just the type of pretentious and
shallow thing that happens in fashion all the time, taking its
influences from the unfortunate and putting it&#x27;s own naive and clueless
fingers all over it. Anyway, that&#x27;s enough about my hatred for the
fashion industry, now for the actual film.<br /><br />Zoolander has the thing that seems to missing from Stiller&#x27;s usual
films, which is sweetness. As gay as that sounds, it helps elevate the
likes of Judd Apatow&#x27;s films above others, and helps you actually care
about the film rather than it being played just for laughs. Tropic
Thunder and Dogeball: A True Underdog Story certainly tried, and
ultimately failed. Although Zoolander is a shallow idiot, he is
certainly lovable. And as Hansel, the always-watchable Owen Wilson is
just a dim-witted. When the two settle their rivalry and team up, there
is plenty of chemistry. Watching them both giggle like children when
talking about bulimia is a scene where if handled badly, could have
been uncomfortable, but the scene is possibly the funniest in the film.<br /><br />Yes, it follows the same path as many other a comedy, and some of the
jokes fail to hit the mark. But it&#x27;s fun, entertaining, and features a
handful of solid comedy performances. And, as ever, Will Ferrell steals
the show as a manically over-the-top designer.<br /><br />www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com
