Not great, but surprisingly, not too bad.  Some funny jokes.  Ben Stiller
was asked (by himself) to carry nearly the whole show, and the task proved
too much, for an odd reason: he can't play dumb.  When he pauses before
speaking we don't sense a stupid man trying to think of something
intelligent to say, but an intelligent man trying to think of something
stupid.<br /><br />The current Malaysian Prime Minister has been in power for over twenty
years.  &quot;Zoolander&quot; opens with the election of his successor, a gifted and
charismatic leader, or so we must presume.  Yet when we meet him we see a
simpleton in an orange Mao suit who is only capable of saying &quot;Ooooh&quot; in the
awed tones of those three-eyed aliens from the Toy Story movies.  Was this
even intended to be funny?
