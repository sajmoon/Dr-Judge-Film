I am generally of fan of old movies, ranging from Gone With the Wind to
The Godfather. That said, I feel that Zoolander is a very funny,
entertaining film, especially considering that it's a relatively
current film.<br /><br />When I first saw it on TV (I rarely go to the movies anymore - too many
bad ones are getting good reviews) I thought I would only watch it for
a few minutes. I assumed it would be dumb - and it is - but it a way
that's genuinely funny. Ben Stiller, his dad, and his mother in a cameo
are all great.<br /><br />But it's Owen Wilson who caught my eye. This is a guy that has the same
kind of good looks, intelligence and charm that some of the best
comedic actors of years gone by had. His broken nose only adds to his
persona. He writes, too. I hope he continues both his acting and
writing career. I've read that he does a lot of improvising, and that
some of his best lines are off the cuff. This is a hallmark of someone
who is truly funny, with great timing.<br /><br />The scenes where he prances &amp; struts (on his skateboard &amp; off) are
perfect. He plays the fool, who is actually not a fool, to perfection.<br /><br />The many cameos in this movies are fun. I recognized several of them,
and so will you. I rated this movies a 7 instead of higher only because
the theme gets pretty trivial and silly at times.
