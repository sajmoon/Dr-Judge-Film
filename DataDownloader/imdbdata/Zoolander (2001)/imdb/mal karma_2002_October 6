Why I didn't laugh? Dunno. Maybe because I was expecting one stupid joke
after another and so on like in Zucker/Zucker/Abrahms movie, those that you
can't help to laugh like one of those idiots starring the movie. Or maybe
Zoolander just isn't funny. No. I'll stick to the first option. Perhaps I
had had a bad day. What's good about Zoolander are the characters and the
female cast. And not to mention the amount of great cameos like Jon Voight
and Vince Vaughn as Derek's father and brother, and David Duchovny as the
deep-throat-anti-conspiracy-former-worlds-greatest-hand-model.<br /><br />If you like Ben Stiller as much as I do, Zoolander is a smart comedy funny
sometimes, that you'll like. Just don't expect to laugh at your ass for 90
minutes, it's simply not enough.<br /><br />6/10
