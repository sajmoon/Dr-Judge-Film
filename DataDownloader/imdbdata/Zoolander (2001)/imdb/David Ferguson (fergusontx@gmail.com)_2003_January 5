2003_January 5 

Greetings again from the darkness.  I put off seeing this for almost 2 years
but agreed to watch when my son rented it.  Surprisingly, there were plenty
of laughs to keep me watching.  However, I must say that Mr. Stiller's
talents appear to be writing and acting - not directing.  5 years since &quot;The
Cable Guy&quot; and he still just doesn't have the feel of a big time director. 
Always enjoyable to see father and son work together (Ben &amp; Jerry) and Owen
Wilson pulls off the male model role thanks to his natural quirkiness.  Most
enjoyed watching Christine Taylor (&quot;the Wedding Singer&quot;), but thought Wil
Ferrell had WAY too much screen time.  An almost unrecognizable Milla
Jovovich was interesting, and Vince Vaughn in a non-speaking role had me
cracking up.  Jon Voight proved again why he doesn't work much these days,
and David Duchovny sheds all pride for a funny turn as a hand model
informant.  Comedy is tough, so I will tip my cap to Ben for keeping me for
the entire movie, so I say &quot;Relax&quot; and enjoy this for what it
is.
