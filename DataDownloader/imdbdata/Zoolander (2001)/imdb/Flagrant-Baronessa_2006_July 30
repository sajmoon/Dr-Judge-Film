Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love D&amp;D, but Zoolander just about surpasses this
film in sheer pointlessness and brainless jokes. It has beyond wacky
performances, escalating stupidity and it features some truly
cringe-worthy moments. It is just completely and utterly insane,
brainless to the core.<br /><br />Zoolander is based off some VH-1 spoof about male models and it takes
this idea much further by bringing these stereotypically dumb
characters to life in the form of Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and
Hansel (Owen Wilson), competing against each other on the runway but
having to team up eventually in order to stop the evil plans of the
prime minister of Malaysia (Will Ferrell). I don&#39;t think I could give
out spoilers if I wanted to, because the plot of the film is thinner
than an Olsen twin. It all fits in the zany world of Zoolander.<br /><br />So this film would pretty much be the prototype of bad cinema, but
sometimes comes a joke in Zoolander that is just so hysterical that it
totally takes you by surprise. This is stuff like a bunch of male
models hanging out and PLAYING WITH GASOLINE and one of them lighting a
cigarette and KA-BOOM!. Or the &quot;walk-off&quot; on the runway between
Zoolander and Hansel. Or best of all, the multitude of random cameos by
famous actors like Billy Zane, David Duchovny, Donald Trump (ok, so not
an actor, but still!), Paris Hilton, Natalie Portman and Christian
Slater.<br /><br />Still, you have got to credit a film that has nothing to say, no
statements to make, no messages to convey -- it doesn&#39;t pretend to be
something it&#39;s not -- it&#39;s just a gloriously entertaining and colourful
comedy. Remember, a &#39;Bad&#39; movie can still be fun to watch.<br /><br />6/10
