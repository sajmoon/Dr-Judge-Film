2002_June 11 

I saw this when it came out in the cinema and i thought it sucked. Now a
couple of months later,it's out on video so being a fan of ben stiller i
decided to give it another go(other people i know seemed to like it) I may
have been in a bit of a mood the first time i watched it but that dosen't
mean a thing,because even though i like it a little bit this time round,i
watched it again tonight and i still don't find it that funny. Sure some
of
the lines were funny and the refrences to 2001 and the godfather part 2
made
me chuckle but apart from that the only over memroble part was the school
for chilldren how can't read and that was in the trailer. It reminded me
of
a poor-man austin powers and the hummor is to forced(ben stiller dosen't
quite come across as a bumbling idiot he seem's to much of an intelligent
person in real life)this film may be rated at 6.1 but it seems to have a
large amount of negitive comments on hear so isn't about time it was
brought
down to a 5.?<br /><br />5/10(watch mystery men instead it's much funnier)
