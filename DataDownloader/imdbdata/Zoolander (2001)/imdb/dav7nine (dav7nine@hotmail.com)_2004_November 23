I thought this film was alright.... not much more....<br /><br />The plot is pretty mental and elaborate: male models are behind all the
major assassinations that have taken place! The characters are pretty
mental as well, Stiller's and Wilson's in very different ways.<br /><br />I only watched it 'cause Stiller was in it. I think Something about
Mary and Meet are Parents are class, so I thought I'd watch this... and
it was alright... could've been worse, coul've been well better.<br /><br />Not much more to say really... definitely not a classic!<br /><br />4/10<br /><br />Dave
