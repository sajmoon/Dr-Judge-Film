When I was told that this movie is dumb I believed and didn't watch it
when
I had the opportunity. However I didn't miss the second opportunity - I
watched it and I laughed my a$$ off!!!
Why people don't love it?! This movie is a pure entertainment, like
Legally
Blonde or Crazy About Mary or Meet The Parents. There's no big philosophy
in
those movies just because it never meant to be. I agree - there are some
comedies that are funnier than others.
Zoolander is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. Don't believe to
people who tells you that it's not worth watching, unless of course you
are
sorely lacking any sence of humor.
