2003_March 7 

Ok first of all I have had up close and personal experience in the
modeling
field,I am related to a very big booker in NY and I can tell you this..he
got it down pat!! I could even name the models he was spoofing LOL..the
fact
is,this movie does not pretend to be anything more than it is..I good and
funny movie about the &quot;ugliness of the beauty world&quot; and he did it
perfectly..I have seen this movie so many times and talked to my relative
about it and even he agreed on the 2 models I had in mind when we talked
about it..get it..buy it..zoolander rules
