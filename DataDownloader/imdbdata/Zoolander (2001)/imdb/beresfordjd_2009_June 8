2009_June 8 
I have tried to watch this movie about 4 times now. I thought maybe I
didn&#x27;t &#x22;get&#x22; it. I realise that I do get it though and I don&#x27;t want it.
I find that Ben Stiller is one of the most irritating &#x22;comic&#x22; actors .
He is overrated to a ridiculous degree. He tried to blame the original
failure at the box office on the fact it was released just before 9/11
but that is a cop-out. The script is painfully unfunny and stuffing a
film with cameos only serves as a prop to hold up the weakness of the
whole venture. I tried to concentrate on it but there was really
nothing to watch. Kudos to the filmmakers for being able to get so many
stars to appear in it but that is really not enough to save it. I
managed to get through 30 minutes this time before I thought to myself,
&#x22;Do you really want to waste minutes of your precious life watching
this pile of faeces?&#x22; I came to the conclusion that I did not. As for
Stiller-wake up people the Emperor has no clothes. Just because he has
connections to &#x22;show biz&#x22; through his family was never any reason to
laud him as a comic genius. Do NOT get me started with Will Ferrell
either!! Owen Wilson has made lots of stinkers too but somehow I find
him more appealing than Stiller on every level.There is not even a
smile in this film let alone any laughs.
