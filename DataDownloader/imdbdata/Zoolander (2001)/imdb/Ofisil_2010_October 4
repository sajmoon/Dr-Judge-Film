Plot: The Prime Minister of Malaysia has made a change in the state
that greatly affects the Fashion Industry&#x27;s economy so Mugatu, a very
important fashion designer brainwashes the extremely stupid male model
Zoolander to kill him.<br /><br />You&#x27;ll love Zoolander if: You like insanely dumb comedies. The
characters lack depth and are unrealistically stupid and the plot is
lame&#x85; but so what??? That&#x27;s exactly what the movie is supposed to be,
just a simple stupid comedy. While not the cleverest parody it makes
fun of the Fashion industry in a nice way, with models being very
self-centered and having the IQ of a lipstick, designers that are
extremely eccentric, (Will Ferrell kicks ass as Mugatu), and generally
things in this movie are stupid but funny. The movie is full of some
quite funny quotes and slapstick humor, dumb characters and crazy
situations&#x85; if you like these stuff you&#x27;re gonna love Zoolander.<br /><br />You&#x27;ll hate Zoolander if: You expect an above average parody, something
with more depth or if you hate stupid comedies. Don&#x27;t expect an
extremely clever movie&#x85; Zoolander is a one of them stupidly wacky ones,
full of cheap laughs and very crazy situations. The characters are flat
as a wall, logic is non-existent and stupidity defines the word
limitless. Example: The 2 main protagonists search for clues and find a
computer&#x85; they don&#x27;t know how to use it so they start jumping around
and hitting the computer like Chimps and when someone tells them that
the files are inside the computer one of them destroys it and upon
seeing the computer broke into pieces he says: &#x22;Hey, where are the
files?&#x22;. Also too much useless and irritating use of famous people
portraying themselves&#x85; I don&#x27;t know about you but I hate that
especially when it isn&#x27;t even funny. Finally the movie is quite fun the
first time you see it but gets 10 times more boring the second time.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Enjoyably Stupid (5.7/10)<br /><br />[+] Lots of funny and stupid scenes and quotes. Nice parody of the
fashion industry.<br /><br />[-] Not a &#x22;clever&#x22; comedy. Could be better as a parody. Only for
renting.<br /><br />Also Check: Austin Powers (1997) - Dumb And Dumber (1994) &#x96; Meet The
Parents (2000) - Scary Movie (2000)<br /><br />P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say &#x22;I like\don&#x27;t
like this movie&#x22; but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not
since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...
