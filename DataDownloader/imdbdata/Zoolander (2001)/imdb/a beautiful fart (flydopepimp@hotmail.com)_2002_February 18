2002_February 18 

i got a free copy of this ben stiller vanity-fest last week, and i'm sorry
to stay i could only sit through the first half hour. i usually don't mind
mr.stiller, but he seemed to be trying too hard to emulate jim carrey and
to
a lesser extent, mike myers. the jokes just fell flat and the sight of jon
voight as zoolander sr. gave me a genuine fright. what were you thinking
jon?
and what the hell was bowie doing in this movie?
this movie was as flat as billy zane's scalp<br /><br />next........
