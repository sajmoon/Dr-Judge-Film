This movie is hilarious. If you aren't laughing at it I can't help but laugh
at you. It's a clever rip on the shallow fashion/celebrity culture in
America and there are some epic performances by Stiller, Ferrell and Owen
Wilson. Dumb and Dumber meets Ready to Wear. The DVD is especially good for
the outtakes and the deleted scenes. P.S. Milla Jovivich is one of God's
perfect creations. I want Zoolander II: revenge of Mugatu
