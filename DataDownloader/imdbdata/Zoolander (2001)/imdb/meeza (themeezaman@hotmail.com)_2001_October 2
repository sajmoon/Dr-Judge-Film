As I finished watching `Zoolander', I was as confused as the main
character's mental state. I thought that Ben Stilller was super as the
mentally-challenged male model Derek Zoolander. But I thought its plot that
involved killing the President of Malaysia was a bit too far fetched. I also
did think Will Ferrell was the right fit to play the freaky-haired malicious
designer. However, I thought that Christine Taylor's performance as the
female reporter made me bulimic.  I thought Director Ben Stiller's mockery
of the model business had a real humorous design to it. But on the other
hand, at times it was too over exposed. `Zoolander' is one attraction that
at times will make you laugh even though it is not the perfect model of a
great comedy.
