I don't know how anyone with a sense of humor could not watch this movie
and
be amused by it.  I was laughing hysterically throughout the movie.  What
I
think is that a lot of people who generally don't like comedies go to see
this and are disappointed.  If you went to this movie expecting the
Titanic,
then you made a bad choice.  Don't blame the movie on you own inability to
pick a movie (based on the trailers) that suits your tastes.<br /><br />If you like Saturday Night Live and the kind of humor presented on that
show, then you will like this movie.  If you like movies like the &quot;Other
Sister&quot; a lot and this is all you watch, then stay away.
PLEASE?!<br /><br />Thats all I have to say about that.
