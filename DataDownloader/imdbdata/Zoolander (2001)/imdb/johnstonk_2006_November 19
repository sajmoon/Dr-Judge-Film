Deep in the concrete jungles of new york there lives a man whose five
syllable name has revolutionized the fashion world. DE-REK-ZOO-LAN-DER.
This is a great comedy and it had me laughing from start to finish. Ben
Stiller did a great job on acting in this movie and also directing it.
He has found the perfect balance between silly and smart. He satirizes
male models that they are all stupid and need someone to tell them what
to do. They pay out on models so much that some may take offense at the
movie, but for everyone else it is absolutely hilarious. Lines like
Derek&#39;s eulogy or &quot;elgoogly&quot; at Rufus, Meekus and Brint&#39;s funeral
really is some great script writing. They use Binary opposition as
well, in genders. Derek and Hansel are males but they are like big
softies and Matilda the reporter is a female but she is really strong
willed and powerful in the movie. This film is Hilariously funny and
easily 10 out of 10.
