Definitely best comedy of 2001, 'Zoolander' is an incredible original movie
with some of the most talented comedians of modern cinema.<br /><br />Derek Zoolander is the best comedic persona since Austin Powers and probably
even funnier. Ben Stiller really made something worthy here, that deserves
at least one sequel.<br /><br />The first 10 minutes of the movie are absolutely hilarious and very
original. I mean this is a comedy about a male supermodel. You cannot fail,
especially with Ben Stiller on board.<br /><br />Of course Owen Wilson is the crazy person he always is and his part works
great. Also the whole Stiller family are fantastic.<br /><br />But even if you don't like this movie, you have to acknowledge the genius of
Will Ferrell who plays Mugattu, an evil Isaac Mizrahi. This guy is
definitely one of the best comedians ever and he certainly helps a lot in
this movie. He came up with the ultra funny line &quot;I feel like I'm taking
crazy pills&quot; and that says it all.<br /><br />Also Stiller's direction is excellent. Tight, cinematic and
interesting.<br /><br />&quot;Audy whaty?&quot;<br /><br />9/10
