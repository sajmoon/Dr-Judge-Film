This movie is funny.  Not the funniest movie ever made, mind you - but
genuinely funny.  BUT - you REALLY have to have an offbeat sense of humor
to
appreciate the jokes!  If your sense of comedy is more mainstream - aviod
this, because it is not for you.  Only for the freaks out there (like
myself) who sometimes find themselves the only one laughing about
something
in a room full of people.  Watch the movie. It's plain old good (for
wierdos, mind you)...
