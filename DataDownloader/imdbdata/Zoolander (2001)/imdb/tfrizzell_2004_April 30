Horribly stupid time-passer has washed-up supermodel Ben Stiller being
brainwashed by crazed fashion designer Will Farrell to assassinate the
prime minister of Malaysia so he can keep production costs down by
using children as slave labor. Stiller knows that something is not
quite right (well sort of) and he ends up joining forces with
supermodel rival Owen Wilson and red hot Time Magazine journalist
Christine Taylor. Together can they stop Farrell's devious plan? Pure
comedic/parody-styled corn here as cameos and whacked situations try to
entertain the audience, but ultimately nothing works. Ben Stiller just
cannot act and he proves here he is no director either. Very slight. 2
stars out of 5.
