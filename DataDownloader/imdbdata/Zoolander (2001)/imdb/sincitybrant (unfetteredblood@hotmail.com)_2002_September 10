A movie I will continue to watch again and again, Zoolander is full of
good
lines worth repeating. I have heard a lot of people who didn't like it and
thought it was stupid, but I don't know what they're comparing it to. I
just
bought it on DVD and it's worth checking out for the special features,
which
add so much more. The character of Hansel is an awesome Owen Wilson role.
Loved it, loved it, loved it. There's not even a low point in the film for
me. Great use of a soundtrack, awesome cameos from Bowie to Billy Zane to
Andy Dick. If you like any of the quality SNL-star movies like Happy
Gilmore
or Tommy Boy you should like this one for its great quotes!
