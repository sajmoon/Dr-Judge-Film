I liked 'Zoolander.' Knowing what the industry is like, I enjoyed the
different perspectives that Stiller enjoyed tearing into. It is pretty
accurate and dead-on, but it never goes too far. Unfortunately, from an
outside perspective, the movie is too stupid for its own good. You will feel
your IQ dropping and you will not like it. Stiller played more for honesty
and accuracy about modeling and believe me, that's too much of a
stretch.<br /><br />Derek Zoolander is finished in the male model world. When he gets a new
contract from an evil agent, he's unknowingly brainwashed into finding and
assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia.<br /><br />The movie sucks really. Between the orgy scenes, the movie references of
some classics, walk-offs(!), none of it makes sense. It's all a joke. If you
can deposit your mind in a safe deposit box for a couple years, forget all
the vestiges of your sanity and you finally watch this, there probably still
will be enough spark there to ask yourself, &quot;What the heck am I watching?&quot;
Despite my personal liking, Zoolander is still very much
garbage.
