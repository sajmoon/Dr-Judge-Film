This was better than i expected. I was slightly disappointed with Mystery
Men, and completely comatose in front of Meet the Parents, which is sad
considering the things Ben Stiller can do. But this was refreshingly
funny,
and i find the lines are endlessly quotable (a quality that i value quite
highly regarding comedies). Good parts played by all. Stiller does
stupidity
with aplombe and i always find owen wilson very easy to watch.
