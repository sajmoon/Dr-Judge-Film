Okay, so it may not be winning too many professional nods from industry
big-wigs (Oscars, Golden Globes, Cannes), but that is not &quot;Zoolanders&quot;
objective. These sorts of comedy movie characters can usually be traced back
to a comedy sketch routine done on a comedy show, so making a movie-lengthed
sketch can't prove fatal. The plotline basically entails a plot to brainwash
Derek to kill the president of Malaysia (something to do with child labor
laws) but the film is so funny, who need a plot!
Ben Stiller plays top male model Derek Zoolander, the most desired and
popular male model in the world. With expertise and an ironic charm, Ben
Stiller sucks in the cheeks and bungs on the accent to get that hilarious
Derek Zoolander attitude that only he can pull off! &quot;Zoolander&quot; is an acidic
look at the fashion world, employing many model stereotypes into the movie
as humour (such as eating habits and tantrums)......and believe me, it does
get the laughs! Without being overly cheesy and spoofish, &quot;Zoolander&quot; is
able to cleverly poke fun at the little seen world of male modelling. Owen
Wilson is fabulous as Derek's rival, Hansel, and Stillers real life wife
Christine Taylor plays a reporter whose story on Derek gains some attention.<br /><br />Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece here. What you'll get is a hilarious,
funky and cameo filled to the brim flick which is a fun option when you
can't be stuffed sitting through films like &quot;Traffic&quot;.<br /><br />***/*****
