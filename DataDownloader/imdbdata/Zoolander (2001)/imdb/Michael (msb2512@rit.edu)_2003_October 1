There are few movies that could bring to mind so many emotions...
zoolander
is one of them.<br /><br />If your sense of humor is sick and inventive, then this is a movie for
you.
If you appreciate Jewish humor, then this is a movie for you.  If you are
a
fan of the inanity of will farell then go no further.<br /><br />The subtlety and cleverness of the actors is very rare... they have a
wonderful chemestry together, Something not usually found in the comedies
of
current day.<br /><br />If you liked the works of Wes Anderson; Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, and The
Royal Tenenbaums you may like this.<br /><br />If you like the work of the farley brothers - especially kingpin - I would
recomend this movie for you.<br /><br />Unfortuneatly, some just don't get this movie, but if you do... then god
bless.
