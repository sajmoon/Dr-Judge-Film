Zoolander was a really funny movie, but it was missing some of Ben Stiller's
talent, like in Keeping the Faith, and Meet the Parents. maybe he needed a
better sidekick other than cutie Owen Wilson. i mean, im not complaining
about the match-up, like the irresistablely-sweet &quot;walk-off&quot; scene, but
Wilson just isnt as funny as people think. this was a good movie, and i will
recommend it, but be prepared to be disappointed.
