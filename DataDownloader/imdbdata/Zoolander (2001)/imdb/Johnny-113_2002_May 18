I'm so disappointed in Ben Stiller.  I think he's a very talented<br /><br />writer, director and actor but he blew it on this movie.  Zoolander<br /><br />might have been a funny character for a MTV short, but is horribly<br /><br />boring to watch for over an hour.  The plot is predictable and<br /><br />stupid.  It's just no fun to watch someone act like such an idiot.  No<br /><br />one is that stupid.  The trailer made the film seem really<br /><br />unappealing.  The trailer was right.
