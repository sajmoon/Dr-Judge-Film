If you love movies that are quotable (Fletch, Blazing Saddles, etc.)
this is right up there. It&#39;s a fun movie that like a fine wine improves
with age. Don&#39;t get scared by other reviewers saying this a mock of the
fashion industry, that&#39;s just a small part of the movie (these people
don&#39;t get it). Watch the movie at least three times before you decide
if you like it, it&#39;s on TBS/TNT/USA all the time so you should have no
problem seeing it almost on demand (there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s on TV so
often, IT&#39;s FUNNY!) You&#39;ll know when you&#39;ve seen it enough times when a
friend of yours makes a slight cough and you off-handedly reply &quot;Got
the black lung pop&quot; or when someone gives you a funny look and you
excitedly proclaim &quot;Magnum!&quot; Watch it, learn it, live it.
