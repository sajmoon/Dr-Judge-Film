What to say about a movie like this? Zoolander definitely did not live
up to the hype of being fall down in your seat funny but it wasn't
awful either. I must admit there actually were a few laugh out loud
funny lines. But by and large this movie is disjointed and somewhat
obnoxious at times. This isn't really the type of comedy that I enjoy
and it seems like Stiller is ALWAYS playing these types of
roles(granted he plays them well but still....)<br /><br />The main positive was the movie's spoofs of the fashion industry and
the people involved in it. I have actually known a few people with
personalities like this. Even though the movie by and large wasn't an
extremely cohesive effort it was funny to see the fashion industry
being spoofed- and some of the jokes WERE funny, in fact there are
moments where just as your getting ready to turn it off because your
thinking how lame it is, something happens to make you laugh and keep
it on.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie only as a late night or if there isn't
anything else on or if you want a really off the wall comedy with
uneven but occasionally wacky humor. This is the type of movie that you
almost feel guilty for defending because all the negatives mentioned
are there but it's not all bad for the reasons listed above. I'd rate
it somewhere between a 5.5 and 6.
