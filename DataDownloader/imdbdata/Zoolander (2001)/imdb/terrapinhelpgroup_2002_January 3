The amount of people who really seem to despise this film surprises me. It
is obviously not to everyone's taste (what is?) but the love that went
into
it's making seems palpable to me. Added to which it's one of the funniest
films I've ever seen, brilliantly acted and directed and has an individual
feel all it's own.
