2003_December 7 

I was chilling when I tuned the movies channel. A movie called Zoolander
was
starting. I decided to watch. I did it for 10 minutes and it was already
one
of the worst movies I've ever seen. I couldn't believe how could Paramount
make such a bad movie! The story of it is so dumn! Furthermore, there's
Owen
Wilson, a terrible actor. He screwed up Eddie Murphy's comeback &quot;I SPY&quot;,
did
such a bad work on The Royal Tenenbaums (which I hated also).<br /><br />But I was disappointed with Ben Stiller. He's a really good actor, how
could
he accept such a job?! Was he needing money? He was terrific in &quot;There's
Something About Mary&quot;, &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and so on, and the was good in
Zoolander also, but the movie was too dumn. I even felt that I got a
little
dummer after I watched it. Don't waist your time watching it: grab a
Simpsons DVD or go read a book that you'll feel much better.
