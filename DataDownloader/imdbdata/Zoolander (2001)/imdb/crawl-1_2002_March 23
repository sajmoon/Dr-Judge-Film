I laughed, repeatedly, during this movie. I also laughed, repeatedly, at
the
people who hated this movie. Please, get a life!
This was a romp designed to showcase some talented people. It was not
intended to be analyzed like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.
&quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; was the last movie of this type where I enjoyed a few
good
belly laughs. What is so incredible is how some folks took this movie so
seriously.
The idea was unique, and the satire using endless cameos of stars was
really
above par. The subtle message about the clothing industry also left a
mark.
America loves cheap labor.
Apparently, America also has no sense of humor. Just kidding!
