Zoolander satisfies all the requirements of a complete story: A beginning, a
middle, and a satisfying end... all presented in the regulation three-act
format to which we have all become accustomed. Heck, there's even a good
back-story, and that's more than can be said for much of what we're exposed
to these days. When a director manages to get all of that onto the screen
then he or she has accomplished something noteworthy.<br /><br />When a film touches its audience in exactly the way the director intended
then that film is a success. There is no doubt that Ben Stiller intended
Zoolander to be a farce... nothing more and nothing less... give the
audience a good dose of the giggles and leave it at that. From where I sit
Zoolander is an excellent example of the modern-day farce.<br /><br />Like most of us, I have a higher than warranted opinion of myself and I like
to think that I'm predisposed to preferring *intellectual* comedy as opposed
to slapstick. (Just when did society officially decide to demean slapstick?)
So the first time I saw Zoolander I just sort of chuckled at all the right
places. But afterwards I thought about the film a bit and realized that it
was indeed a complete story and not just a collection of gags. So off to the
rental house I went...<br /><br />I'm not sure how many times I've seen Zoolander to date, but I do know that
in order for me to watch a film so often that there has got to be something
to it. Whatever that something is, Zoolander has got it. And director Ben
Stiller knew how to put it there.<br /><br />This film is worth seeing several times.
