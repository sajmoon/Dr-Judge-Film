For some strange reason this movie was always out at Blockbuster. All 20+
copies were always rented which means that every night 20+ people wasted
an
hour and a half of there lives that they can never have back. Although Ben
Stiller is one of the funniest guys in movies, he falls flat on his face
in
this crapfest. I did chuckle once or twice but that was just out of pity
for
Stiller. The movie is loaded with lots of celebrity cameos, which is fun
for
the viewer but rotten for them because they will have this stinker on
their
resumes. I recommend Meet the Parents or Something about Mary for vintage
Stiller but please skip this big steaming pile of a movie.
