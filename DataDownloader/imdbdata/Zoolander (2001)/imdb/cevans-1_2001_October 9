This certainly wasn't the funniest or most intellectual film ever made,
but
Owen Wilson gives yet another stellar performance in his role as
supermodel
Hansel. While Ben Stiller simply acts retarded as Derek Zoolander (that
whole &quot;D-A-I-Y-E&quot; scene made me want to throw my shoes at the screen),
Wilson applies his unique brand of charm to his character, which is just
about the movie's only saving grace.
