The DVD edition of this movie is quite a different experience than the
theater experience. It was released just after 9/11, and does feature some
New York City locations, and goofy, loopy plots involving the 3rd world.
Remember how the critics savaged the film at that time? They called it
everything insensitive to tasteless. I admitted then that it WAS a bit hard
to watch, with the recent violence so fresh in the world's
consciousness.<br /><br />But hey! Time passes, wounds heal, we all get stronger and move on. Watching
&quot;Zoolander&quot; now, it is clear that it is a brilliant satire, and sheer comic
genius. Or at least comic really, really, goodness. Please do yourself, and
the world, a favor and watch &quot;Zoolander&quot; on DVD. It may be a totally lame
and stupid gesture, but it will show those who would injure us all that we
CAN laugh at ourselves, and them.<br /><br />It's a shame such talent (just check out the cameos and cast list, for
goodness' sake!) and such potential for audience joy had to be put on hold.
Uncontrollable events might have postponed &quot;Zoolander's&quot; acceptance--- but
now, perhaps, and in the coming months, folks will be able to see the satire
and the humor without cringing. In a few years, I bet &quot;Zoolander&quot; will be a
comedy classic, and nobody will even be able to remember that there ever
even WAS a fuss over it. They'll simply watch it on cable or DVD (or
whatever we'll be watching then) and laugh--- and think what fine talents
Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, et al. really
are.
