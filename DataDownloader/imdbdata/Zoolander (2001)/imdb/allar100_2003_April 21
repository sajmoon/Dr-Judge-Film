This is a movie that took me a time or two to warm up to it, and now it just
gets better the more I watch it.  WARNING*****  this is by no means a good
film.  There are tons of better and funnier movies out there that you could
watch, and if you do watch this one, you might not like it at all.  So make
no mistake, it is really stupid, you just have to check your brain at the
door, and enjoy all of the shameless cameos by, well, everybody.
