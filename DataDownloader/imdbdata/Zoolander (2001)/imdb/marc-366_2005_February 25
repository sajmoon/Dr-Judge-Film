Maybe I am being unfair. Maybe I wasn't in the mood. Or maybe I just
didn't understand. But this seemed to me to be an incredibly poor film.<br /><br />The jokes didn't work. I felt that I should laugh, but it was pathetic,
and I couldn't master a single giggle. Hey, I love stupid humour. I've
wet my pants at the likes of Bottom, South Park and Alexi Sayle on many
occasions. But this puerile single joke movie left me feeling brain
dead. Mystery Men worked, because the super hero theme and great cast
carried the fact that it wasn't particularly funny. I'm afraid,
Zoolander and its take on male models didn't work at all.<br /><br />My girlfriend loved it though, and maybe she is always right.
