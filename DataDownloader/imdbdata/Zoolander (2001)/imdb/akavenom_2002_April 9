I should've rented it first......
I should've taken my wife's disgusted look, as I picked it up to add to my
collection....as a definite hint.......
where is my receipt.....and is there anyway I can return
it....??<br /><br />ok...Ben Stiller = funny
Owen Wilson = funny<br /><br />But this is the stupidest movie I have ever seen...well not the
stupidest(and trust me I have seen quite a few). It doesn't quite rate up
there with the Alligator in the  NY sewer movie, but it is riding on its
tail.  The plot is old and outdated and out performed lately by other
movies(i.e. austin powers), the characters, playing the role of dumb models
aren't even remotely believable.  The additional roles of some very famous
people is about the only thing it has for it, but let's face it, that
doesn't carry that far.  If you are in the hospital or jail, or you just
forced into viewing this movie...chuckle even if you dont get the joke.
Otherwise do something more amusing like clipping your toenails.  And Ben
next time you need money, don't bait me, just ask!
