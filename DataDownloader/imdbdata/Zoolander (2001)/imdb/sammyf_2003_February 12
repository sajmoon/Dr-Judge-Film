it seems like people are completely split about his one. Either they love
it
or they hate it. I, for myself, had so much laughs in this one, that I
even
ordered it on DVD ... As some of my favourite directors are Kubrik,
Kitano
and Greenaway and I'm generally considered by my friends to be a
film-snob,
I had to wonder WHY I found Zoolander so entertaining, while thinking
that
'meet the parents' was ... ~mostly adequate~.<br /><br />if you laughed during at least one of these Monty Python sketches,
chances
are you won't be disappointed by Zoolander (you might not absolutely love
it,
but you probably won't hate it at all)<br /><br />* the 'Is you wife a'goer' sketch (wink wink nudge nudge)<br /><br />* the 'English Upper Class Twit Contest' sketch
* the french cursing at the englishman in 'Monty Python and the holy
grail'<br /><br />* also from The Holy Grail : the Llamas credits
* and, while we're at it, the troyan elk scene from the same
movie<br /><br />hmm ... Zoolander is, in essence, as silly as the silliest of the MP
sketches. MP did some extremely intelligent sketches in very silly ways
(just to stay with the same source, the peasant scene and the witch scene
in
MP&amp;tHG are examples of witty social commentaries IMO), but you won't
really
find that in Ben Stiller's comedy. What you will find is complete
sillyness
and stupidity witch might carry some message, but ... well ... the
stupidity
overshadows it by far.<br /><br />
