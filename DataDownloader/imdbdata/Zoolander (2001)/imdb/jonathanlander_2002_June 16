Now I like silly comedy as much as the next guy but all I could think
throughout the viewing of this one is &quot;how could Ben Stiller do this?&quot;.
And
worse how pathetic to prop it with Jerry Stiller and Anne
Mira.<br /><br />Nothing more then a Saturday Night Live extension and brand marketing
vehicle (look out for the flying Starbucks cup).
If you're desperate for something to pick up at the video store go for it.
Otherwise get it for free during the in-flight entertainment.
