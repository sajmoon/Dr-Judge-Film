Although I had seen Zoolander for sale at stores, it wasn't until both
XBox
Nation and The Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine gave it glowing reviews
that I decided to rent the Zoolander DVD.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is a great actor trying to come out from the above-average
product he's been in. He's due to do something grand in Hollywood and
although this film has some laughs, this isn't his breakthrough.<br /><br />In this film, Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, the best male supermodel in
the
world. He recently lost his crown to the weirdly-snouted Hansel McDonald
(Owen Wilson, complete with his Texas accent). Upset, he is used by a
group
led by a madman designer named Mugatu (Will Ferrell) to assasinate the
leader of Malaysia because he plans to eliminate the child labour that
produces all his clothing. Chrsitine Taylor plays a reporter who tries to
unravel the conspiracy and save Zoolander from committing the
deed.<br /><br />Stiller, who stars, directs, and co-wrote and co-produced this, delivers a
nasally &quot;Kids In The Hall&quot; performance as the dumb Zoolander, as does
Wilson
as the naive Hansel. Jerry Stiller (who play's Zoolander's agent) plays
Jerry Stiller. Will Ferrell is a hoot as Mugatu, with his crazy hair and
antics. Christine Taylor is only in the film so Ben can show off to the
people what a lovely wife he has. Milla Jovovich is wasted as the she-male
with the James Bondian name.<br /><br />The film does have some good laughs and the movie is done in an 80's style
with lots of music in the background, but even at 90 minutes, it starts to
wear thin. You get annoyed by Ben's impersonation of Kevin McDonald of
&quot;KITH&quot;.<br /><br />This film is filled with tons of cameo appearances, including female
supermodels who are the real people being spoofed because of their beauty
on
the outside, shallow and dumb on the inside persona. Also, the DVD
contains
tons of theatrical trailers, extended scenes, deleted scenes, out takes
(including commentary by Stiller in the deleted stuff), an alternate
credits
film, some spoofs of modeling at the VH1 awards, and a music video. Quite
a
lot for a short film. Still, I believe that Stiller's best is still to
come.
I feel he can do some good in a dramatic role like he had in Reality
Bites.
