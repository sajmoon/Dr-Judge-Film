&quot;Zoolander&quot; is a hysterical movie that has non-stop laughs and endless
memorable quotes. I'm not kidding when everyone had told me that
&quot;Zoolander&quot; was one of the funniest movies they'd ever seen, so I had
to give it a chance. I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson give a parody on male super models that is
beyond tears of laughter. Ben Stiller plays &quot;Derek Zoolander&quot;, a 3 time
&quot;Male Model of the Year&quot; award winner, when his streak of wins is
stopped by Owen's character, Hansel, he starts to doubt his career and
wants to go back home with his father and brothers as a mine worker. He
pretty much fails due to the lack of his being used to high maintenance
type of environment with clear air and less, well, work. When his
father tells him that he's no longer part of the family, Ben gets the
offer of his career or so he thinks. Will Ferrel plays Mogotu, an evil
model agency owner who is trying to kill the prime minister of Molesia
so he can continue to have children make his clothes. He figures people
would assume that Derrek has lost it with his career so he can easily
frame him and brainwash him into killing the prime minister for him.
When a journalist played by Ben Stiller's wife, Christine Taylor,
Matilda finds out about this, she tries to save Derrek by hiding him
&quot;where no one would know he's there&quot;, hence at Hansel's house. Hansel
is very forgiving and confesses that he was wack and Derrek was his
inspiration to be a model and Derrek claims his wack of being jealous.
There they have strong tea and learn of the lacking in Matilda's love
life and why she hates models. Hansel playfully says &quot;I think we should
get naked... don't talk, just give into the power of the tea&quot;. Followed
by a very strange but amusing orgy where Derrek just happens to fall
for Matilda. But Derrek will NOT miss a show and there is a certain
&quot;relax&quot;ing music that will cause him to kill the prime minister of
Molesia! Can he make it past the beautiful celebrities and save the
day? <br /><br />Ben, Owen, Will, and Christine work perfectly together in this great
comedy about male super models. This movie has non stop laughs and
you'll immediately buy it when you see it. If you can't laugh at this
movie and it's amazing rounds of cameo's, I don't know what's wrong,
because this movie doesn't deserve to be under a 7.0. Trust me, this is
a great movie!<br /><br />9/10
