Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind you would say is a comedy, but to
me just as much a drama. I actually had more sorrow than laughter in
this movie, especially from the lead parts. I am not going to go into
huge detail into what the plot is about. I am just going to say that
this is a romantic comedy that really you should find in the art-house
section at your local video store.It is mainly about a man and a woman
who happen to fall in love one day, and suddenly the woman erases all
memories of her times with him and now the man has to go on this big
quest to win her over.<br /><br />The movie is fun to watch, as we see time travel sequences constantly
and some supernatural happenings as well. I actually quite forget most
of the movie, not because it was boring or anything, but because I
really couldn't understand it myself. You see, I have a hard time
understanding most twists that occur in movies.<br /><br />The acting is superb, with Jim Carrey playing his part excellently,
usually stealing scenes from Kate Winslet who did a decent job too.
Co-stars Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson as
the doctor conducting the procedures to erase the woman's memories are
all solid in their roles, but as I said, Jim Carrey is a standout.<br /><br />This is not the type of movie I'd go out and buy, but I just can't get
past the originality of it. There is nothing more you could want out of
this if you are into these kind of movies.
