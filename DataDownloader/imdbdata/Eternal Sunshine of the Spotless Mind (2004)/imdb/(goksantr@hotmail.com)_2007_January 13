If you are looking for something that will grab you from your heart,
from your brain and also from your subconscious, then you have come to
the right place. Michel Gondry&#39;s excellent technique of serving the
breath taking scenes of this film is totally astounding. There are
times when I desire to beam my self up into the enchanting scenes of
the film, there are also times which forced me to miss some scenes due
to my inner evaluations of my past relationships. Be prepared to go
blank sometimes. You may need to rewind some scenes because of
self-criticism. Those who are prejudiced against Jim Carrey, will
experience a great shock while watching this gifted gentleman. And Kate
Winslet is mesmerizing with her performance. The soundtrack and the
lighting of this masterpiece is also flawless. Supporting players like
Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst have shown a great performance. This
film became one of the best films of my life and is unlikely to resign
from my top 5 of all times.
