I love Kate Winslet EVEN MORE after this film. The first hour is a
mind-boggling, yet exhilarating experience. Winslet's diversity is on
show in every scene she is in and she deserves every award going.<br /><br />Kaufman and Carrey have progressed their talents with this - for
Kaufman it feels like a necessary extension to Adaptation and Carrey
fulfils the potential he hinted at in The Truman Show.<br /><br />My favourite scene takes place in the kitchen of Carrey's childhood.
Winslet and Carrey deliver furiously energetic performances. Both using
their bodies perfectly. The interplay is out of this world.<br /><br />On a smaller scale the effects are surprising and in the scenes when
Carrey goes back to his childhood they're spectacular.
