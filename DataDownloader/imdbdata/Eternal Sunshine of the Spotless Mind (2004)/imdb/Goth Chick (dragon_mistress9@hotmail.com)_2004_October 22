This is the first Jim Carrey movie I've actually enjoyed!<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a quirky dramedy starring Jim
Carrey as Joel, a sort of boring, middle-aged man who desperately needs
some interest in his life, and Kate Winslet as Clementine, a very
feisty blue-haired/red-head/orange-head/green-haired younger woman who
is just the person to give Joel just that.<br /><br />As the movie develops, we discover Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark
Ruffalo), Mary (Kirsten Dunst), and Howard (Tom Wilkinson) all come
into the picture as scientists specializing in memory alteration. Now,
this is where things would get confusing if the director hadn't used
the particular first scenes that he so eloquently did. <br /><br />The rest of Eternal Sunshine is told throughout Joel's memories, which
he's been wanting erased. Unfortunately, half-way through the
procedure, he realizes he wants to hold on to these precious memories
(in lack of a better term)--uh, oh!<br /><br />If you're worried about the content of the movie, other than the
swearing, there's nothing really harmful. There's a few joints passed
around, and a butt crack courtesy of Ruffalo's character, but it's
fairly harmless. <br /><br />Overall, I give it **** out of *****
