The title made me wary a bit, but my girlfriend convinced me to watch
this movie. I am happy we have seen it.<br /><br />IMO the movie has a good balance of substance, comedy and action. I am
glad that science fiction elements could contribute (set the stage) to
this film, while it equally concentrated on storytelling and character
development.<br /><br />I could identify with the main characters of the movie. I felt their
struggles and was engaged throughout. The supporting cast was also
excellent in their roles and the story developed unforced. It is hard
to say more about it without disclosing plot elements of this movie. Go
see it and make up you own spotless mind about it!
