I loved this movie. Not because of great acting or writing but because
it says a lot about the world we live in. Have we as a people really
turned to blocking out memories that we don&#39;t like? In my opinion it is
the bad memories that define us. We all have good memories like
graduation, weddings, birthdays, but those don&#39;t make us who we are. It
is the memories that we wish we could forget like the deaths, and low
points and how we recover from them that reflect the person we are
today. And to erase a bad memory to me is like erasing a part of me
that is human and real. Never the less the movie is a great love story
and one of Jim Carry&#39;s best roles. enjoy.
