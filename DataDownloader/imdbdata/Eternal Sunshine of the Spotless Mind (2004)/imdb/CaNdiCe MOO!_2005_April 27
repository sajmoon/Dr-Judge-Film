when i saw this movie, i loved it. <br /><br />at first glance, it's a light, maybe boring romantic comedy. it's about
a man named joel and a woman, Clementina, who likes to switch up her
hair colour. they meet and start dating, but when they break up,
Clementina decides to have him permanently erased from her mind so she
won't have to live with the pain of missing him. joel decides to do the
same in revenge, but while the operation is being done he realizes how
much he wants to hold on to her. it's a pretty original idea actually
compared to most romantic comedy things today. jim carrey's great as a
shy sort of guy. in general he plays the loud, annoying funny
characters, but here he switches the approach to nice and timid. it's a
nice change and he portrays his character well. i think he put in a
great performance.<br /><br />some parts are definitely amusing, and it runs deep when commenting on
love and how it can surprise people. but it's too bad that it doesn't
really work for people who don't get touched by these sorts of dramas.
just a word of caution there.<br /><br />i think it's a great movie for thought, if not a really great movie for
laughs on a Friday night out with a crowd. definitely good for a quiet
evening at home. i'd recommend it for sure: one of my faves!
