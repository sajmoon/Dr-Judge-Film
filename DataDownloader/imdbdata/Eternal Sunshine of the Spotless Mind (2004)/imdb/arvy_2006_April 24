An original film.<br /><br />Winslet is very annoying in the first 10 minutes, but sit through it if
you can. It pays off much later.<br /><br />Jim Carrey on very good form and his role in the film is worth it on
its own. Winslet is a little on the annoying side (and if you aren&#39;t a
fan of hers, you will hate the first few minutes) however she is
clearly fulfilling a very specific role.<br /><br />This film deals with a &quot;kuki&quot; love story and the bits that sometimes go
wrong. Trust me on the first 30 minutes, it does get much better!<br /><br />It will make you think about relationships.
