Jim Carrey (The Truman show) stars as Joel, a man who learns his
girlfriend has had him erased from her memory. Not wanting to suffer,
Joel goes in for the same procedure.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is a true romantic drama, telling a realistic and
dramatic tale of relationships, through the good and the bad, and with
some stunning performances, writing and direction, make a wonderful
heart wrenching drama.<br /><br />Carrey gives one of his finest performances as Joel, a man wanting to
erase his girlfriend from his memory. We saw Carrey&#39;s wonderful
dramatic side in The Truman Show, and here he builds on it with a deep
and moving performance as a lonely and upset man, and is brilliant
alongside Oscar nominated Kate Winslet (Titanic).<br /><br />Winslet gives an outstanding performance as Joel&#39;s girlfriend
Clementine, one of her finest on screen roles. The two have great on
screen chemistry and create the necessary drama to go with a wonderful
written plot.<br /><br />Though slightly confusing, the plot has all the right elements to
justify the romantic drama genre, including a realistic portrayal of
relationships, the good, the bad and the easy and the hard. The good
times the pair go through, including lying on an ice pond and observing
the constellations are what dreams are made of, and the accusations of
nights out without your partner are what nightmares consist of, giving
the film the realism required to justify the genre and the reason
behind the memory being erased.<br /><br />The ideology of memory erasure has no doubt been in the mind of anyone
who has had a truly bad relationship or experience, and the dramatic
twists Eternal Sunshine gives will make you think again.<br /><br />Great support is given by Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), Mark Ruffalo
(Zodiac) and Kirsten Dunst&#39;s (Spider-man) best ever performance.<br /><br />Flashbacks of Joel and Clementine&#39;s time together are directed well,
with some comedic moments, including a 4 year old Joel, which is Carrey
at his comedic best.<br /><br />The plot loses a bit of ground by jumping around at different times
during the opening credits, not to mention the ending will require
another watch, but is definitely worth it
