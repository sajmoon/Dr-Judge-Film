IMDb Top 250: 61<br /><br />Sound a little confusing? It is. The movie is. But it&#x27;s confusing in s
good way, a dreamy way. It&#x27;s the first movie which features the opening
credits as a plot twist. But you won&#x27;t figure out it is until the end.
If you figure it out. With a distorted sense of time and an interesting
narrative style, Eternal Sunshine is a unique film that will exercise
your mind in more than one way.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is a romance with sci fi elements. It&#x27;s fantastic.
Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are really great, and have true
chemistry: Carrey, the awkward Everyman, dressed in all brown, and
Winslet the quirky, upbeat girl with vibrant colours. Seeing them
together makes you smile.<br /><br />The four other supporting cast members work well together. Ruffalo as
the nerd-type scientist, Elijah Wood as his bud, who is kind of weird,
Kirsten Dunst as the the secretary who offers up a twist of her own,
and Tom Wilkinson, who I have yet to see as a faithful man in a role.
They&#x27;re good distractions in a two-person film.<br /><br />The film has a dreamy, quirky atmosphere, like my favourite film Donnie
Darko. They actually have a few connections: love stories, lonely
leading men, upbeat original music, and twists that demand a second
viewing.<br /><br />If you like relatable characters, an original and well-scripted plot,
or critically acclaimed movies, see this: it&#x27;s arguably the best
romance ever. If you hate happiness, don&#x27;t see it. You&#x27;ll feel great
after seeing this. 8.7/10
