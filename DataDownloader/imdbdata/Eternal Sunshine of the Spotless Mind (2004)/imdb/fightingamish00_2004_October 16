Should we be surprised. Kaufman has written another spectacular one. If
all love stories could be like this one, chic flics would never exist,
and what a wonderful world this would be. This is a must see movie for
anyone who has ever had regret for being in a relationship and this
will soon become the ultimate &quot;break up&quot; movie. The acting could have
been better but it really doesn't matter. I think someone else could've
done a better job than Carrey and Winslett. They were out of they're
element here and it showed. I'm a huge Carrey fan and am really rooting
for him, but he didn't do it for me in this movie. But that's just
nitpicking b/c the movie stands alone and Carrey does well enough for
me to get by. This movie truly relates to feelings of breaking up and
sort of works backwards than most movies. Because Kaufman wrote it,
it's very original and enjoyable. This is a must see movie for this
year and is easily one of the best I've seen this year.
