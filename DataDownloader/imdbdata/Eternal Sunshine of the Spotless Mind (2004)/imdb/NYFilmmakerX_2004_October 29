I remember the first time I saw &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind&quot;, was right after I finished taking my last final at school. I
went in expecting something great but the word &quot;great&quot; falls short of
what it really was. After seeing this film it changed my views on life
and love. Walking out of the theater, I felt something which I have
felt few times feeling, upon leaving a theater. I felt a sense of
completeness. So, (a) there will never be an &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind 2&quot; and (b)Everything that wanted to be said was said and
that's all there is. Although with this completeness in the film, there
is so much already to breakdown in film it needs nothing more. I write
this review mainly to inspire those who haven't seen this film to see
it. Hopefully, you too may discover these new views on life and love.
