This was one of those movies that after some time made me want to stop
watching it. But something made me keep watching it and finally love
it. Just to hate it again and so on.<br /><br />There are some ups and downs throughout the movie, but just bear with
it because it all comes together in a very nice way. I just wish that
it could feel a little more realistic. I guess that the subject of the
movie is something that we all have been thinking about a few times. At
least everyone that ever has been in love.<br /><br />This is not a movie you should see if you have lived a sheltered life
without any troubles or broken hearts. You have to have something to
relate to in order to understand the feelings behind every occurrence.<br /><br />Oh and, I didn't expect this from Jim Carrey, but this actually is a
decent performance without all the overacting and yelling.
