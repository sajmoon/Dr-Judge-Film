Once again, writer Charlie Kaufman creates an interesting story that
challenges traditional cinema with &#39;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind&#39;. In this film, the audience experiences first-hand the
psychological trauma of Joel (Jim Carrey)as he loses and tries to hang
on to his memories of Clemintine (Kate Winslet). The cinematography and
special effects truly capture the dream-like sense of being in Joel&#39;s
head while the scenes in Joel&#39;s apartment ground the film in reality.
With some strong performances from Carrey and Winslet, as well as the
supporting cast, &#39;Eternal Sunshine&#39; is a worthwhile film to see.
&#39;Eternal Sunshine&#39; does, however, have its challenges. Similar to
previous Kaufman screenplays (like &#39;Being John Malcovich), this film
requires its audience to be patient as the plot does move along slowly.
While this film does offer something unique to the film industry it may
not be for everyone. But if you are prepared to step outside the
boundaries of Hollywood cinema and into the world of independent film,
&#39;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#39; is an intriguing place to
start.
