I found this movie very interesting. Gondry did a very good job of
weaving the relationships between the characters involved. I originally
did not want to see this movie because I didn&#39;t think Jim Carrey was
very good in more serious roles, but after watching it I must say that
he did an exceptional job. All the characters cast for this movie fit
their roles perfectly. Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood were especially
good. I really like these type of comedies, ones with a smarter outlook
on comedy. This isn&#39;t a movie that any idiot can pick up and watch. The
humor is very witty and takes intelligence to find it funny. I really
like movies like that. All in all, I would recommend this movie to any
intelligent human being who can understand smart humor.
