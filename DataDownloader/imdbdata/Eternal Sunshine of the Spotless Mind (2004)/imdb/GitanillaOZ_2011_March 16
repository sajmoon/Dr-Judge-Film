Eternal Sunshine is a philosophical analysis of the nature of love and
relationships. It reflects very well the changing emotions associated
with falling in love and the ups and downs of personal relationships,
and how unnecessary it is to erase our emotional past to survive. None
of this is said or discussed in the movie, as this is a metaphorical
film that uses the visual narrative to approach these points.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is one of those movies that many people would see
twice to fully catch all the details because the editing and what
happens in the film is complex since there are three different time
moments, narrated in not chronological order, sometimes overlapping
each other. It is not a film for simple minded people or those who have
to have everything digested and masticated before presented to them.
This film needs of an attentive attention and mental involvement.<br /><br />Jim Carrey surprises every body with a role that shows what a great
actor he is, and how versatile too. He&#x27;s superb as Joel, a lonely
insecure and depressed guy who tends to get involved with women who are
the opposite, and how he faces love, abandonment, rejection,
loneliness, companionship, etc. Also excellent (and outside of their
usual roles) is Kate Winslet in her role as Clementine, a cheeky
cheerful girl addicted to flashy hair dyes, who is attracted to boring
men.<br /><br />The lyricism of the music, the surreal scenes, the poetic
cinematography, the part of the movie showing Joel efforts to preserve
the memories of the past he initially wanted to destroy, the fact that
the special effects are no such a thing but camera tricks and the
result of a meticulous preparation and tampering of the movie sets,
adds even more artistic value to this unique piece. The director and
the editor of the film really deserve a big praise, as the movie is
indebted to them beyond belief.<br /><br />The only flaws I saw in the movie are the little romance mini-stories
related to the technicians and doctor of the Lacuna Clinic, which do
not contribute much to a film that otherwise would have been perfect,
and the outcome linked to those actions could have been presented in a
different way.<br /><br />I would not call this movie a comedy, but a light drama.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is a magical, unique and unforgettable movie. A piece
of art, really.
