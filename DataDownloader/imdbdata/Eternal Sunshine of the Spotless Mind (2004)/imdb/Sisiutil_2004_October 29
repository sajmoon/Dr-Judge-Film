I really hate Jim Carrey.<br /><br />Not the man himself, I've never met him and don't claim to know the
first thing about him.<br /><br />No, I hate several of the roles he's had and the public persona he's
created for himself--the rubber-faced &quot;wild and crazy guy&quot;, who's
asinine, juvenile, derivative, and, worst of all, unfunny. I also hate
the achingly pretentious, I'll-get-an-Oscar-somehow-Robin-Williams-did!
Jim Carrey too.<br /><br />But I really hate him, most of all, for making me admire him so much in
this movie. Damn him for having so much talent after all!<br /><br />He did something I've never seen him do before: he made me forget he
was Jim Carrey. Like Robin Williams before him, he suddenly graduated
from a comic who does movies to an actual actor, and a damn fine one at
that.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that he's surrounded by so much talent, especially Kate
Winslet, showing off just how chameleon-like the best British actors
can be; Elijah Wood effectively distancing himself from Frodo; Kirsten
Dunst playing shallow to start but somehow breaking your heart by the
end; Tom Wilkinson playing the banal, brilliant, and benevolent doctor
who turns out to be all-too-human; and of course, a brilliant,
typically-original script from Charlie Kaufman (and director Michel
Gondry and Pierre Bismuth).<br /><br />I liked how the story limited itself to just the one science fiction
element, and kept everything else realistic. Too often Hollywood
forgets the idea of introducing one fantastic element ONLY in a story,
and we end up with flying cars whizzing by. Removing the memory of an
ex is, like all great SF/horror elements, just a metaphor; haven't we
all, after a painful breakup, burned, thrown out, or destroyed all the
precious little mementos of the affair in a desperate attempt to purge
the whole thing from our brains? The story's not about the SF element,
after all. It's about memory, the power of will, and of course, it's
about relationships and love.<br /><br />That's probably its greatest strength. This film has one of the most
realistic depictions of a relationship that I've ever seen outside of
real life. All the ugly arguments and ill-considered outbursts are
there. But--and it's brilliant how these are only gradually revealed,
and at least halfway through the film--so are the unexpected moments of
connection, the sheer, unabashed delight in actually seeing inside the
soul of another and having them see into you. And, ultimately, the
necessary acceptance of the loved one's imperfections--and their
acceptance of yours.<br /><br />This is a great movie.<br /><br />But I still hate Jim Carrey. Because he made me like him. Jerk.
