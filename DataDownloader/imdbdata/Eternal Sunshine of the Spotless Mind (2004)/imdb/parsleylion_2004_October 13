I found this movie told a typical movieland story that is one of
romance in an unusual, and like most Charlie Kaufman screenplays,
thought provoking way. The movie made me feel good afterwards and while
it's not airtight in its logic it has a few 'and then what happened'
kind of moments where they are needed. Having said that it is a bit on
the slow side, the characters are just alright and the scenarios are
interesting but not really explored in a truly funny belly laugh kind
of way or a 'hey thats something I never thought of' or thats a really
unusual perspective. Having said that it is fairly inventive and
convoluted enough to make most cave men and women leave scratching
their heads though I don't think movies should be made for the dumbest
mind on the planet so I couldn't care less if my fellow trogledytes get
it or not. I would like to see Kaufman's ideas put together with a
funny writers gags and routines now that would make a fine movie. If
there is supposed to be something funny in ESOTSM it didn't register
for me. Having said that it was good and it is worth a viewing.
