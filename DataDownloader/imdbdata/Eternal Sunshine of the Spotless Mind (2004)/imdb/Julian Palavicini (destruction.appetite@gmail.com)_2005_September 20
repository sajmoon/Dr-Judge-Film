This movie is about a very lonely guy, Joel Barish (played brilliantly
by Jim Carrey). He lives alone and have a very routinish kind of life,
but one day he meets a girl, Clementine Kruczynsk (Kate Winslet), and
they really click. So, the time pass and they break up, Clementine
erases her memory of him in a place that specialize in that, and when
he finds out he decide that he want it to, so the movie begin, and its
a journey in his memory. At first, all the bad things why they break up
are the stuff he forgets, but then he begin to forget the good things
and he want it to stop.<br /><br />Well the movie is great, is a very different way to tell a story and
the way is done it just brilliant. Jim Carrey make an excellent job, as
Kate Winslet did.<br /><br />Its a love story but no the traditional type. So if you like different
movies, it doesn't matter what gender is your favorite, I guarantee you
will enjoy this movie, and of course, this isn't a movie for everyone,
so if &quot;transporter 2&quot; and &quot;the dukes of hazzard&quot; are you favorite
movies better miss out this one.
