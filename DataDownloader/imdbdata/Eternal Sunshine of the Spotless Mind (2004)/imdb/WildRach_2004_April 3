It truly is a shame that moviegoers these days are ignorant, misinformed,
and searching for something that isn't there. Charlie Kaufman is no
genius.
He is a mainstream, large-budget writer/director who creates films that
appear independent and artsy and original... but by nature, they are just
the opposite, and he makes a lot of money. His movies, and I'm not sure if
Adaptation or ESOTSM is worse, are disjointed and pretentious. His
dialogue
begs for reality, and he creates movies with the hopes of forcing the
viewer
to feel something. News flash Kaufman, you can't force people to feel
something. And the people you do force, they don't have minds or opinions
or
the experience to know different. It makes me sick that those who see this
film will believe they now understand the art and culture of the indie
film... THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Please, can we inform and educate our
public of true movies, movies that don't have huge budgets, star A-list
actors who are dying for a mainstream film disguised as a indie
phenomenon,
and pretend to be something they are not. It is insulting and embarassing,
and those who enjoyed this film because it was &quot;beautiful&quot; and
&quot;meaningful&quot;
and &quot;unlike anything else&quot; and &quot;artsy&quot; should dig a hole and bury
themselves
in it. Worthless creatures.
