it really would be nice if we could expunge selective memories. but
then we wouldn't learn from our mistakes.<br /><br />Jim Carrey has come a LOOOONG way since those awful 'pay yer dues' days
prancing around in a diaper on the lowest-common-denominator 'living
colour' with the wayans brothers. whose latest fare is the abominable
'white chicks'. Jim Carrey absolutely shines in this film. and Kate
Winslet too.<br /><br />Jim Carrey's varied roles in my opinion, are his attempt to branch out,
experiment, to discover his strong points. well, he has succeeded. he
is now firmly in the category of serious actor. but, being Canadian, he
doesn't take himself too seriously. you don't hear a lot about Jim
Carrey making impossible diva-like demands on his handlers etc. He's
still young too, so we have a lot to look forward too from this fine
actor.
