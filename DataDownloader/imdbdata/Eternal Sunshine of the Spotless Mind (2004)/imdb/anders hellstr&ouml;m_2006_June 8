This movie was just so well thought through and Jim Carrey does his
best performance since the majestic! The first 20 minutes is a bit of a
drag, but when the credits roll, one will understand the whole thing
and look back at the the beginning in retrospect with total
satisfaction. <br /><br />Kate Winslet has, at least to me improved her acting skills and this
movie whiteout a doubt proves her development.<br /><br />As there are many movies on the market right now which have a tendency
to resemble each other, this was a original and it touched me
significantly. Beautiful story!
