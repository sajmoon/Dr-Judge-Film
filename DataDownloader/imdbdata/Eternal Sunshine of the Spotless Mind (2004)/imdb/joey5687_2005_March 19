After watching a preview for this movie on another film, I decided to
rent it. Quickly I realized that this was not going to be a comical
movie. The direction of originality that this film portrays is
excellent. I was glued to my screen the whole time not wanting to see
the ending. During the first part of the movie it did seem a little
hard to follow though. After a while though I was able to grasp the
concept... or at least I thought so. This is definitely a date movie to
bring your someone special to watch with as it will end up being the
next romance movie of our time ranking with those infamous titles as
&quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and &quot;Casablanca&quot;.
