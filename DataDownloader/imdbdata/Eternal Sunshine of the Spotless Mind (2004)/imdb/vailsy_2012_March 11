as someone that has recently gone through a very long and very painful
breakup you would think that I would be the perfect audience for this
film. no. quite the opposite actually. It instead highlighted how
lacking in substance the movie was. it in no way for one moment even
came close<br /><br />the idea is good and so the problem is in the execution, especially the
casting of the lead roles. I didn&#x27;t at any point feel that Winslet and
Carrey were in love with each other which is kinda an important
ingredient for this film to work<br /><br />I never really liked Winslet much to be honest, I find her very self
absorbed and self indulgent and she never really appears to give
anything on screen to her co actors. Jim Carrey is okay but feels
shallow in this one. overall him and Winslet just do not feel like a
good match at all. probably Carrey and Dunst would&#x27;ve been a more
interesting couple<br /><br />in terms of production values I saw or heard nothing exceptional.
visually and sonically I found the movie very grey
