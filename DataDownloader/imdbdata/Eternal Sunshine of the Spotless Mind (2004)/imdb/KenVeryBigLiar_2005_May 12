I'm not a great fan of romances since most of the time they tend to be
very corny, exploiting cheap feelings to get audiences. But this one is
different. Although it is still a romance, the story is unusual, and
the way it is told is also very unusual. The way the film seems to
introduce an element of fantasy, as we sometimes are inside the mind of
the characters, looking at memories of each other, and the way they
struggle to avoid being erased from each other's mind. I loved it. This
is also an opportunity to watch Jim Carrey show that he is a great
actor, although we usually associate him with movies like Dumb &amp;
Dumber, Liar Liar, Ace Ventura, etc.<br /><br />A very interesting love story that is very well told...
