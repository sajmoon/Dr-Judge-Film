This film is the best I have ever seen. I cried on four different
occasions during the screening of this film. It contains Black Comedy,
Drama, Sci-Fi. It is so amazing. I would whole heartedly recommend this
film to indie type film lovers. It over all is just a masterpiece of
emotions. Out of the thousands of films I've seen this would be in my
top three favorites. This film proved Jim Carrey was an amazing actor.
And the quote that gave th film it's wacky title-&quot;How happy is the
blameless Vesals lot, the world forgetting by the world forgot- Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind!- Each prayer accepted and each wish
resigned. The shots in this film are &quot;godly&quot;. I highly recommend this
film for anyone looking for a tear a laugh, a thought, a different
light, it is over all the astoundingly brilliant. In every scene of the
word.
