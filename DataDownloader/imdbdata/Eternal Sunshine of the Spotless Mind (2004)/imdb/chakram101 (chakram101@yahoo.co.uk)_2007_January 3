This film (like Fried Green Tomatoes) is a keeper, for me, It will
Always be one of my now 2 favourite films. Why? Because it really
touched me. This is a film anyone can connect with. It is truly
universal in my opinion. Anyone can relate to this film, as I did, in
spades. As most people I&#39;m sure, I was initially wary of Jim Carrey
being in this film, as I&#39;ve found him to be too cartoon like in films.
But I have to say, he really pulled it out the bag for this one. In my
opinion, this is his best film to date. So if you happen to be a Carrey
fan, and not seen this already, What are you thinking?! I watched this
film, for Kate Winslet, as I am a huge fan of hers, and her work. She&#39;s
without doubt one of England&#39;s best Actors. And she didn&#39;t disappoint.
Her portrayal of Clementine, was spot on, and it was her character I
really connected with.<br /><br />Michel Gondry is an amazing director and the techniques used in the
film, are amazing, yet seemingly simple, but really amplify the
atmosphere of the film.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this film, will become a Classic, I&#39;m sure. Maybe of the
Shawshank ilk. As I think the following of this film has grown and
grown more, from rentals maybe. Not sure.<br /><br />But in my opinion, definitely THE film, that has to be in everyones
MUST SEE FILMS, before they die.<br /><br />The combination of Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Michel Gondry, and Charlie
Kauffman, is a resounding hit for me. A++++++++++. 10/10. I&#39;m so happy
this film was made.
