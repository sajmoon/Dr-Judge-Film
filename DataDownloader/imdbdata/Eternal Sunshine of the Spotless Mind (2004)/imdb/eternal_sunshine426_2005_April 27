I went into this movie with very high expectations, and I left the
theatre with immense satisfaction. This film was all I hoped it to be
and more. It was so refreshing to finally see a film that was
completely original and unique; one that didn't feel the need to follow
a simple formula. Charlie Kaufman's dialogue is bold and realistic, two
things that can make a film more plausible and enjoyable. <br /><br />Jim Carrey gives the performance of his career while portraying Joel,
an ordinary man that falls in love with the outgoing (and sometimes
outspoken) Clementine (Kate Winslet). When their relationship takes a
turn for the worst, Clementine makes a trip to Lacuna Inc., a place
that specializes in erasing bad memories. When Joel finds out that
Clementine has had this procedure done, he decides to as well. However,
as the procedure commences, and Joel revisits all of his memories of
Clementine, he begins to realize that their relationship wasn't as bad
as it seemed.<br /><br />Thoughtful and emotional, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a
bittersweet romance that won't disappoint. One of the best films of
2004.
