The greatest thing about this movie is that there are really weird
science fiction kind of staff going on but the movie doesn&#39;t feel like
a science fiction movie or even a weird movie , it all feels natural.
Reason for this are : <br /><br />1)Honesty : the actual love story is one of the most honest ones , it
has its ups and downs like real life ,there are some serious things
they don&#39;t like about each other , they will never live happily ever
after , yet you feel like they might always love each other and its
heart warming. <br /><br />2)Acting :very natural , staying away from overacting , Jim Carrey
actually surprised me , he should have an Oscar nomination but
ironically you need to overact for that.<br /><br />3)Lightning and camera : i read that Michel Gondry didn&#39;t want to use
any lightning at all but they used some in the end , the camera also
reminds you that it&#39;s there , it&#39;s shaking a little , these even
sometimes make you feel like you are watching a documentary. <br /><br />While they tried to market it as a romantic comedy , i think this is an
anti-romantic comedy , a very sad and deep movie. with the things
falling apart in most of the time in the movie i felt like my heart was
falling apart. and with lines like ; &quot; Clementine: This is it, Joel.
It&#39;s going to be gone soon. Joel: I know. Clementine: What do we do?
Joel: Enjoy it. &quot; it connects everything to real life itself in an
upsetting but enlightening way.
