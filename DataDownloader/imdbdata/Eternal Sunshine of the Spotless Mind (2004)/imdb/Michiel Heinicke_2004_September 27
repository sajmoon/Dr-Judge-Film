2004_September 27 

2004 is a year filled with over the top sequels and downright crappy
movies. there are a few exceptions, and then there is Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind.<br /><br />You have to see it to believe it. It is a roller-coaster ride from the
beginning till the end. It shows that true love doesn't die, not even
if you erase your loved one from your memory.<br /><br />This is Jim Carrey's &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;. He managed to refrain from
pulling his trademark weird faces and behaviour. Only once in the
kitchen scene can he be himself for a little while. The script is what
you expect from Charlie Kaufman. A little surrealistic, tender and
funny. The other actors shine as well. Kate Winslett has never looked
this beautiful.<br /><br />I wish I'd meet a girl like Clementine....
