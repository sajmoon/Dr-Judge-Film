Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind came out of no where and blew my
mind. A friend recommended the movie to me and i was skeptical at the
premise. Jim Carrey plays Joel who tries to erase the memories of his
ex-girlfriend Clementine, played by Kate Winslet, because she erased
him from her memory. To me the movie sounded like a silly comedy movie
but it is in fact just the opposite. The tone of Eternal Sunshine is
rather dark and serious most of the time.<br /><br />I was hooked instantly with Jim Carrey&#x27;s narration. It was brilliant, i
instantly empathized with his character. At first you see Joel
depression caused by his break up with Clementine. Later in the movie
you see several of Joel and Clementines good and bad memories. Along
the course Joel realizes his mistake in erasing Clementine and
internally struggles with himself and the people performing the process
of removing his memories to keep his memories of Clementine.<br /><br />I felt deep empathy for Joel every memory sad, funny, happy or cruel i
felt it as Joel did. Jim Carrey is great in this role. His character is
just average Joe, a real easy person to relate to. Winslet creates a
unique but still believable character in Clementine. She played the
role great. Winslet and Carry&#x27;s chemistry was great.<br /><br />The shots were great but every so often the distorted memories got a
little to crazy, it was a little disturbing and kind of over the top
but maybe that was what the director intended.<br /><br />Anyone can like this movie. Those who like craft in their movies and
those who just like a good love story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind is a one of a kind love story with brilliant acting, great editing
and sound with a terrific plot.
