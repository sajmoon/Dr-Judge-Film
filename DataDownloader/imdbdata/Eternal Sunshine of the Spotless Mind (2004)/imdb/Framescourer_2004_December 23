Carrey is a esoteric choice for this film: he is the straight guy to
Winslet's (excellent) wild-child Clemetine. His comic ability has to be
suppressed almost throughout the picture - the DVD special features
help to point out those moments where he's improvising or caught
off-guard by Winslet/Gondry and they are conspicuous. However I did
sympathise with the character, and was convinced in my head if not my
heart.<br /><br />The Ruffalo/Wood/Dunst support is also very good indeed: I found
Wilkinson a little out of place, but only because he creates a
sympathetic character where more moral weakness seems necessary.<br /><br />The laurels however for Gondry and Kaufmann who have really created
something special with this movie. As in many great films, a rough test
is whether or not you enjoyed it or 'made the journey' without really
understanding what was going on. I often got lost but found that it
didn't really matter. It's a romantic comedy so give it a go - don't be
put off by the 'spiritual' title 8/10
