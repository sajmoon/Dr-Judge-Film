This is originality at it's finest. Aspiring writers are all jealous of
Kaufman's brain. The heart of this movie is Carrey and he does a very
credible, convincing job of playing his part. We all know Carrey as the
over the top comic who can't calm down. He is the opposite of this in
this movie. Winslet is as vivacious as ever but it is Carrey who truly
shines here. This is yet another movie that uses its supporting
characters to weave a tale. I will part with others in calling this the
best movie I have seen this year (in my mind, that still goes to The
Terminal) but I did enjoy it and felt that I was watching something
highly original. I hope the Academy will honor Carrey with an Oscar nod
for his work in this movie. In addition to a screen writing nomination
for Kaufman. 8/10
