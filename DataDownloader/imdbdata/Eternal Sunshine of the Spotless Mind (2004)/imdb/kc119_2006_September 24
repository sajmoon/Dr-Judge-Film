2006_September 24 
I first watched this movie in October 2004. My relationship of over 4
years had just ended a few weeks prior, so this film couldn&#39;t of come
at a worse time, or better time. I could relate to every word, and
every scene. One of the first thoughts i had when my relationship
ended, was wishing i could erase every memory of her from my mind to
stop the pain. Few films today are successful at touching the viewer
emotionally, and if anything, this one does TOO good of a job. So i
commend the cast and crew of this film for their excellent work. Jim
Carrey, Kate Winslet, Michel Gondry, Charlie Kaufman, Jon Brion, Ellen
Kuras, and the amazing editing job by Valdis Oskarsdottir.<br /><br />I recently watched this along with Kaufmans&#39;s Being John Malkovich as a
double header. Two films that remind me that originality in films is
still possible.
