this movie is to die for! it has the best original screenplay in a
while and come Oscar time this shouldn't come home without some man
gold, Jim Carrey is awesome in this movie and all those who despise him
for the cable guy and some other less than perfect movies, just pretend
he's Joel Barish, regular three dimensional guy who Carrey plays, you
shouldn't have to try too hard because he is great in this, along with
wonderful acting by the perfectly cast Kate Winslet and Elijah Wood and
very fine acting by Mark Rufallo, Kirsten Dunst (who was better than
normal, her voice wasn't as distracting) and Tom Wilkinson. this movie
shouldn't be missed unless you have a good excuse, you have no soul of
heart, you have no attention span, or your I.Q is below 50 then don't
see this movie
