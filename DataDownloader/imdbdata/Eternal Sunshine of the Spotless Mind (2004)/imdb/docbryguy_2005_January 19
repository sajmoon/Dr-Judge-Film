I just recently watched this movie with my 3 friends, all for the first
time and all 4 of us went out and bought the DVD the next day. It's an
emotional love story with an occasional comedic twist. It's a movie
that makes you think, but in the end doesn't make you over-think or
confuse you with the plot. It's definitely a movie you need to watch
more than once to fully figure out what is going on, but the movie is
worth seeing more than once. It's the type of movie to watch with a
girlfriend or boyfriend because of the romance that is exuded by Carey
and Winslett. I definitely put this movie in the top 10 of movies I've
ever seen. Absolutely brilliant.
