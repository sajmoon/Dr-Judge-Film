I haven&#39;t read any reviews for the movie but I am sure mine will sound
the same. Wow. Jim Carrey was excellent and so was Kate Winslet. Jim
Carrey has really showed what he started to in the Truman Show that he
can play non comedic roles. Not only can he play them but he is great.
Along with that the concept in this movie is great. Who wouldn&#39;t want
to be able to erase some memories or a person from their memory.
However, this is not the reason this movie is such a hit. Condry moves
in and out of Joels memories telling a story of both Joel(Carrey) and
Clementine&#39;s(Winslet) relationship and the reasons that have led them
to erase each other. What really gets the movie going is when Joel
decides not to erase Clementine and the interesting events that unfold.
While skipping from Joel&#39;s memories while he sleeps to what is going on
around him all the characters stories tie together. <br /><br />I do not want to reveal anything a preview will not but I do want
anyone who has not seen this movie know that you are 100% missing out
on a good movie experience that has many interesting events and does
not follow the typical Hollywood form of the money making movies today.
This is a story that makes you feel for Joel and Clementine almost like
you are involved in the whole thing. I watch this movie a lot. Which
says a lot as I have about 250 movies on DVD and another 60 on tape(and
these are movies I like not just any movie I see) . I typically don&#39;t
watch movies to often but this one grips you. So if you haven&#39;t seen
this movie take a 5 minute trip to blockbuster, best buy, or wherever
and rent/buy this movie.
