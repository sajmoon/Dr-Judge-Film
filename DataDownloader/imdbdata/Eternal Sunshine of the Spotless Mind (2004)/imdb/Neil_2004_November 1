&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; &quot;Adaptation,&quot; &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind,&quot; all great and all nothing like the run of the mill grist the
movie industry usually grinds out. Nice to see big stars willing to
take a chance on a script that can't have been easy to follow in
written form. This film is well-done, and Jim Carrey shows once again
he is capable of more than just delivering one-liners. The film world
needs more movies like this and less movies like &quot;Captain Corelli's
Mandolin,&quot; &quot;Reindeer Games,&quot; and &quot;Maid in Manhattan.&quot; Boycott the next
piece of crap that shows up at your local cinema (Gigli; Catwoman;
Coyote Ugly; etc.) and spend your coin supporting projects like this.
