Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) has just discovered his girlfriend Clementine
(Kate Winslet) went to some company to have her memory of him erased.
He&#x27;s so devastated that he goes to that very company to have the same
procedure done. During the process of erasing his memories of her, he
realizes he still loves her and tries to stop the procedure.<br /><br />Jim Carrey, playing against type, gives his best performance to date.
He shows his funny side but proves he can also be a good dramatic
actor. Kate Winslet is nothing short of wonderful. She glows as the
eccentric Clementine. The supporting actors all do very well, even when
they&#x27;re given little to do. The script by Kaufman is second to none. He
pens a classic and beautiful love story in the most original and
interesting way. No wonder he got the Oscar. Michel Gondry&#x27;s direction
is weird, to say the least, but it is imaginative and inventive.<br /><br />I think the message of this film is that no matter how many faults your
partner may have, you can&#x27;t help but love them for who they are. It&#x27;s a
message mostly everyone can relate to. And the actors and filmmakers
make it memorable along the way. Satisfyingly Sweet!
