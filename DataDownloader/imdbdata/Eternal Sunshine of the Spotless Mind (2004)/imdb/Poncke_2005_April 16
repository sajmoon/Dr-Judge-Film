Duderino's, is this the best movie ever or what. Its nice that movies
like this one, Butterfly Effect and Being John Malkovitch are being
made. Its really and truly amazing how you can visualize a story like
ESOTSM. Class A+++ work and thumbs up for the Director. And not to
forget Jim Carey which is one of my favorite actors. And again and
again he proves that he is one of the best actors of today. I really
find it amazing that he started as a comedy actor and proved himself of
being a great drama actor. The Truman Show was his first drama roll and
also that movie is a great movie.<br /><br />Never Look Back, The Future Lays Ahead
