Joel Barish(Jim Carrey),depressed and forlorn over being pushed out of
a relationship with his flaky but irresistible girlfriend
Clementine(Kate Winslet),decides he&#39;ll also go to get his memory erased
at an experimental procedure,headed by a kindly doctor(Tom Wilkinson).
During the process,Joel makes the realization that he,in fact,despite
the pains that Clementine put him through,doesn&#39;t really want to lose
those memories of her,and proceeds to fight the process as it is
happening to him.<br /><br />Director Michel Gondry co-wrote this story with none other than
existential re-arranger non-pareil Charlie Kaufmann,and the end product
is no less stunning or thought-provoking. Basically,this film is a love
story minus the rapturous wonder of BEING in love. It&#39;s a realization
of appreciating a relationship and what one gets from it,through the
good AND bad. This is a concept that&#39;s probably been danced around
before,but I have to believe it&#39;s never quite been examined THIS way
before.<br /><br />Jim Carrey and KAte Winslet are in rare form here,Carrey in particular.
Eschewing his usual,rubber-faced absurdity in favor of a straight
caricature,while it&#39;s not a complete departure for him(some examples:
MAn on the Moon,The Truman Show),it is somewhat out of form for the
one-time stand-up,and he is excellent here. Winslet gets a chance to
A)not be English and B)be a character that is probably somewhat
difficult to be lifted from the pages it&#39;s been written on. Wilkinson&#39;s
role as a doctor who may be more scrupulously at question here doesn&#39;t
APPEAR to be different than usual(try In the Bedroom),but he still
mines this one for effectiveness. The supporting turns by Mark
Ruffalo,Elijah Wood,Kirsten Dunst,Jane Adams and David Cros are
considerably less defined but(particularly in Dunst&#39;s case)nicely
workable into the fabric of this story.<br /><br />Difficult movie material to relate to any average audience to be
sure,but as another comment person put it,if you &quot;get it&quot; with this
film,this will be quite the positive movie experience.
