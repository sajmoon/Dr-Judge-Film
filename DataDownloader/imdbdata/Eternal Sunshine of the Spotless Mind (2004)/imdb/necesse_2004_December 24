seriously. after just being dropped from a weird relationship or
whatever you'd call it, the movie makes you figure. even if you're not
in my situation, i think you were - once at least. nevertheless: it
does make you think about what your former partners meant to you. <br /><br />i loved the movie. no doubt. <br /><br />i think you will too. i knew nothing about the flick before i saw it,
had no expectations at all. it might be one of the better movies i ever
saw. i think i need to see this in a month or so again - so i can
decide, for real.<br /><br />the story is amazing. i loved the earlier movies by kaufman, but at
first glance.., this is by far the best.
