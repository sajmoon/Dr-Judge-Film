After a lukewarm reception in 2001 with &quot;Human Nature&quot;, Charlie Kaufman
has
teamed up with director, Michel Gondry again for this romatic fantasy.
With
a name like Jim Carrey, this second collaboration couldn't go wrong in
terms
of box office success, and nor should it as this film is quite simply
brilliant.<br /><br />&quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; centres around the life of Joel (Jim Carrey) a shy,
mild
mannered man who is heart broken after splitting from his feisty,
impulsive
girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet). A short while after their split, he
meets her again while she is working at a library and he is stunned to
discover that she doesn't recognise him. He later finds out that the
reason
for this is that Clementine has had her memory of Joel wiped out
completely.
Dr Howard Mierwick (Tom Wilkinson) has performed an operation on her brain
after Clementine visited his clinic to forget Joel. Much to Joel's
distress,
he decides to do the same, but during his operation he revisits memories
of
Clementine that he struggles to let go of.<br /><br />If anyone was in doubt as to whether Jim Carrey can act, this is the film
that will put all doubt out of the way. He performs with sensitivity and
warmth, never once verging on the manic rubber faced lunacy to which he is
most well known for. Out of all the perfomances where he has stepped into
the dramtic role (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, The Majestic), this
has
got to be his best yet. Kate Winslet is also brilliant as his
unpredictable,
adventurous girlfriend.<br /><br />Kaufman's story of a man going into a surreal dream world is not too
dissimilar from his earlier work, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. You have off the
wall images such as Carrey re-enacting his 4 year old self along his
journey
in his head. The eccentricity of the story, which is Kaufman's trademark,
once again works excellently. When watching this you generally care for
Carrey and Winslet, in much the same way as Bill Murray and Scarlett
Johansson in &quot;Lost In Translation&quot;. Gondry's diection gives a bittersweet
flavour to the tale.<br /><br />The sub plots involving the supporting characters who are operating are
ingenius. Tom Wilkinson once again proves that he is one of the best
British
actors of his generation and he is backed up by great performnces from
Kirsten Dunst and a post-LOTR Elijah Wood.<br /><br />This is a lovely film and if you like originality with a sense of fantasy
with a love story, then I suggest you see it. It's one of those films
you'll
want to see twice.
