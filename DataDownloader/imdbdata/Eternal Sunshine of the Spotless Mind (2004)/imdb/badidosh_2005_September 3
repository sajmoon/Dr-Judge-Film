I really liked the idea of &quot;Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind&quot;
although, unfortunately, I haven't yet seen other works of screenwriter
Charlie Kaufman. The premise of memory erasure/loss may have been done
many times before, but what transpires in this film is an excellent
idea, a great insight into the human essence of memory and emotions.
The direction of Michael Gondry and the script themselves are great and
the film is even more amazing when coupled with great acting from Jim
Carrey and Kate Winslet.<br /><br />Joel Barish (Carrey) discovers that his long-time girlfriend,
Clementine (Winslet), has undergone an experimental procedure of the
Lacuna Corporation headed by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), in
which all of her memory of Joel is removed, after the couple has tried
for a long time to get their relationship working fluidly. Joel sets
for revenge and decides to undergo the procedure as well, to erase his
memories of Clementine.<br /><br />At this point the film alternately takes place between reality and
within Joel's mind as he follows his memories of Clementine backwards
in time as each recent memory is replaced. However, once the process
starts, Joel realizes he doesn't really want to forget Clementine, so
he starts smuggling her away into other areas of his memory where she
doesn't belong and that causes some changes about his memories as well.<br /><br />Most stories about love try to present a good story and, for all their
faults, always have decent intentions. But if the ultimate aim is the
human essence of love, then a lot of these films failed. &quot;Eternal
Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind&quot; does not fail in this regard, and it is
justified by the touched feeling I got from watching it.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman is a sterling writer, if this be the basis for that.
The direction is, as Michael Gondry has shown here, flawless and the
music perfectly matches the camera flow and character movement. From
its haunting introduction to the ebbing and flowing of the memory
scenes, the cinematography and the music are so in tune with each other
in giving the movie its brand of eccentricity.<br /><br />Despite the somber tone of the movie, Carrey doesn't seem out of place
here. Actually he is still a lot of fun to watch. His acting perfectly
captures Joel being lost between reality and imagination - subtly
shifting from the material world that is stored in his memory to
vignettes of abstractions while trying to save Clementine from the
process of having her erased permanently. Winslet has the natural
beauty and charm as Clementine. The supporting cast of Elijah Wood,
Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst all impress, too.<br /><br />Essentially, this movie offers one of the most stunningly inventive and
intuitive glimpses at the human emotional nature and its resistance of
fate that I have seen - a stunning portrayal of grief forged of a
failed relationship and the abrupt ending of it. If this film is about
anything, it is about someone about to go under, grabbing at the only
life preserver a person can ever see - one's memories.<br /><br />As I've said, the direction and acting extend this beyond mediocrity to
excellence, the main actors especially allowing the many moments of
reminiscing to speak for themselves. The mind is strength itself, and
it is shown through the flashbacks and tweaks at reality. It is human
mind and emotion depiction at its finest and that rarest of things - a
movie so good to be erased from memory.
