2004_October 8 

I was expecting this film to be the best film of 2004, but sadly I was
disappointed. Not by the superb performances, or the very original
screenplay, but by the sloppy directing of Michael Gondry.<br /><br />This film misses Spike Jonze who brought us Being John Malkovich and
Adaptation. Gondry's work on Human Nature is much more tidy, and more
of a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend that you see this film, unless of course you're a
die-hard Jim Carrey fan who thinks he's going to see Ace Ventura 3. (and
no it doesn't exist, I just got bored and felt like writing that.)
