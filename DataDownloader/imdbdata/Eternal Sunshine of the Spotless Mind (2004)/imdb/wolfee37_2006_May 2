Joel (Jim Carrey) is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine
(Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship
erased. Out of desperation, he contracts the inventor of the process,
Dr. Howard Mierzwaik (Tom Wilkinson), to have Clementine removed from
his own memory. But as Joel&#39;s memories progressively disappear, he
begins to rediscover their earlier passion. From deep within the
recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr.
Mierzwiak and his crew (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood)
chase him through the maze of his memories, it&#39;s clear that Joel just
can&#39;t get her out of his head.<br /><br />The film is imaginary, sad, and funny and it is wonderfully acted. I
have always liked Charlie Kaufman films but this one blows the others
right out of th water.
