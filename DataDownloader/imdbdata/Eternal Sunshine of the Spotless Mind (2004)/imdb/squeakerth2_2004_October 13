I just had to add a huge raving review for Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind. I think it's one of the best movies I've seen in a
really long time. Very creative, very original, it's one of the
greatest love stories of the deepest kind, but yet so much more. It has
an enticing storyline, excellent acting, and the visual presentation is
spectacular. <br /><br />I'll have to admit that in some ways I was a little reluctant to see
the movie. I haven't been a huge fan of Charlie Kaufman's work to date.
Don't get me wrong. I like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, but I
don't necessarily love them. Eternal Sunshine keeps the quirky
creativity that is trademark Kaufman, but the tone of the movie is so
much different. It's intelligent, but not condescending,
thought-provoking, yet entertaining.<br /><br />All in all, if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it without
reservation.
