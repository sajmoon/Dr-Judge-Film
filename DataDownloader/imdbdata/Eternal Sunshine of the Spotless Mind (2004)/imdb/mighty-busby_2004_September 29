This is a wonderful film. One of the most realistic relationships I
have ever seen displayed on the screen. Comedy bleeds throughout the
movie...you will spend as much time laughing as anything else. I do not
want to ruin the film if you have not seen it so i will do my best to
hint at my favorite scenes without destroying the wonder of the movie.
First my major complaint would be the final moments as the conclusion
is drawn further and further out to keep audience in suspense. The love
of the couple develops...appearing shallow at moments and deeply
profound the next. Decisions made by Jim Carey that he wants to change
midstream but not sure how to correct his decision so he must go deep
inside to reverse his decisions. At various points a character or two
either consciously or unconsciously become the villain with whom Carey
must fight with both hands tied behind his back. i wont tell you if
&quot;good&quot; prevails, but i will tell you that you must watch this movie.
