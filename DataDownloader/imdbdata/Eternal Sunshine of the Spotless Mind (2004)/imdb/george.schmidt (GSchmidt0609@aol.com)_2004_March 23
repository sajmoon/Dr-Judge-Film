ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004) *** Jim Carrey, Kate
Winslet, Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Jane
Adams, David Cross. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman once again baffles the
mind and logic of cinema with another patented loopy love story set on
end this time with a sad sack (Carrey) who discovers his ex-girlfriend
(Winslet) has had a procedure done to literally erase all memory of his
existence which prompts him into a spontaneous spiteful choice to do
likewise with unexpected circumstances to crop up, namely love is a
powerful thing to try to forget. Filmmaker Michel Gondry (who adapted
Kaufman&#39;s equally goofy &#39;Human Nature&#39;) manages to technically get the
feel for a second rate sci-fi appeal to the film with some unique
camera trickery but there is scarcely any believable chemistry between
the two principals (maybe that&#39;s the point? If so then it works) &#150; not
to dismiss their excellent turns here; it just felt like something was
missing to make it an instant classic.
