This is a real mind bender (no pun intended). I really liked the
premise because it opens up great implications for us all. How far are
we from the manipulation of specific brain centers? We can already do a
fair amount. The reality is that even if one can erase memories, we
can't curtail the &quot;butterfly effect &quot;of our actions. We have trod the
earth and the small or large changes we inspire, create something new.
Now project love and romance, and, given time, let it percolate. You
have Jim Carry and Kate Winslet being &quot;forced&quot; back together because
despite their minds, they never left. And if the memories were
inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to
influence. Pretty thought provoking. We are more than our memories--we
are part of the entire picture.
