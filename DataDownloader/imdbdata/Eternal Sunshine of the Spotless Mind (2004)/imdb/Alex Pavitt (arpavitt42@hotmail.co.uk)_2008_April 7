The teaming of whimsical director Michel Gondry and mind-bending writer
Charlie Kaufman was bound to end with the creation of a film that
refused to stick to normal cinematic boundaries, but still compelled
the viewer. However, Eternal Sunshine went beyond levels of wacky
beauty and intellectualism that even the most optimistic viewer
would&#39;ve hoped for.<br /><br />Starring Jim Carrey as Joel Barish, who wants to remove his impulsive
ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) from his memory after she did
the same to him, it focuses mainly on the importance of memory to
humanity, and how beneficial it is to keep even the worst memories. The
film is composed mainly of a journey through the psyche of Joel Barish,
as he watches as the team of erasers, Lacuna Inc, destroy all his
memories However, the main reason for watching is the beautiful, quirky
and tumultuous relationship between Carey and Winslet. The chemistry
between the two is unmistakable, with Carey leaving his ordinary comedy
role to play a timid neurotic who is too nervous to appreciate the joys
of life, and Winslet playing up her role as the extrovert girlfriend
that awakens Joel&#39;s senses.<br /><br />The two main characters play on every emotion that the audience can
bear; doing the utmost to ensure that there is no minute of film in
which our humanity is not being played like a violin. Each insult they
hurl during their relationship hits us hard, each tender moment is felt
as deeply. Gondry and Kaufman set up scenes of eccentric beauty
throughout, from Carey and Winslet lying on their backs on a frozen
lake, to a comically sweet &quot;baby Joel&quot; scene. And throughout this, our
beliefs on what memory is, and what it does, is poked and prodded,
examined whilst we watch and wonder ourselves what our own memory would
be like.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood provide fine support as
Lacuna staff with their own intriguing secrets. Wood excels especially,
a side plot involving his character falling for Clementine and using
Joel&#39;s identity to try to win her heart is a fine separation from the
main plot, whilst still adding more layers to Clementine as a
character.<br /><br />The universe that is created here, where people can be free to run
around their own minds, experiencing their lives all over again, is one
that simply should not be compressed into under two hours. The audience
wants more when the film finishes, more of the elegantly idiosyncratic
touches that are deftly moulded into the memory scenes for one, but
also more of Joel and Clementine, what is next for them in their
relationship. For without their engaging love story at the centre of
proceedings, this film will be no more than a series of fanciful but
emotionless tricks. With Carey and Winslet pitch-perfectly playing this
ambiguous relationship, emotion is one thing that this film certainly
isn&#39;t lacking.
