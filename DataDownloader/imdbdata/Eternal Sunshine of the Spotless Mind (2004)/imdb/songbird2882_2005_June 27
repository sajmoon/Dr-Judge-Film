This movie was a little confusing at first, and then about half-way
through everything made sense and an entertaining, worthwhile movie
suddenly became profound and very poignant. Kate Winslet was charming
and affecting, and even Jim Carrey was all right, though I generally
don't like him. All the acting was superb, and the dialog witty and the
movie had a nice progression. Not a good date movie, as after viewing,
I found myself delving deep into my own memories and questioning the
turning points in my life. It's intelligent and odd, but likable, and I
think even those who stray from the independent or quirky style films
will find a place in their heart for this one.
