What if I could offer you the chance to feel better about life? About
the painful times you may encounter. About the relationships you&#x27;ve
endured which were doomed from the start. About the stress on your
shoulders every day you wake to leave for work. I would probably give
you a DVD of Eternal Sunshine. When the credits appeared on my first
viewing, I didn&#x27;t feel anything. I just sat there in a numb like state,
trying to view life in a different way, and sometimes it worked. And
sometimes it didn&#x27;t. And then it hit me in a few days. I realised that
this movie had changed me.<br /><br />It makes you view life in an entirely different approach. Jim Carrey&#x27;s
mellow, sensitive narration throughout gives your state of mind a new
accomplice, more like a friend it&#x27;s never had. They both work at the
same time, you&#x27;re thinking about the image of yourself in his
situation, you witness his life through your eyes, and not his own. I
don&#x27;t want to write about the technicality of his performance, so long
story short: his acting is perfect. Each scene reminds me of a sequence
from &#x27;Magnolia&#x27;, medium length and bittersweet.
