ESOTSM is responsible for opening my eyes to some fundamental truths
behind love and relationships. Namely, a relationship is more than the
sum of its parts; love transcends the physical and that the definitions
are entirely up to you and your beloved. This film seems to have
serendipitously fallen together - a beautiful, accidental collision of
an intense script, gorgeous cinematography, playful and creative design
and editing, unique performances from some formerly typecast actors,
and a wonderful score. This film gives back as much as it demands from
the viewer, which few films do these days. Be prepared for some serious
reflection. Thank god that surrealism has found a new and more relevant
life in the hands of Michel Gondry. See this film alone and then see it
with someone important to you... it might change your life.
