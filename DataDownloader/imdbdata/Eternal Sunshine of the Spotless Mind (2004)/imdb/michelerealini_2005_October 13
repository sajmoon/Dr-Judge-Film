&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is a very interesting and
original movie. We can see that French director Michel Gondry directs a
very unconventional story, scenes are not shown in chronological
order... Gondry takes a solid piece and enjoys himself in
deconstructing it, he likes cutting the material in small pieces! Jim
Carrey tries to forget the failure of his love story with Kate Winslet.
A doctor helps him to erase the past from his mind, but at a certain
moment he tries to stop that process.<br /><br />The film works and has the style of semi-independent American films
like &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; of Spike Jonze: surreal, funny, with a
great dose of delicate madness... In fact we have the same
screenwriter: Charlie Kaufman.<br /><br />A good movie. It's also a pleasure to see Jim Carrey in non-weird
roles, he can act like any real good actor (he already demonstrated
that with &quot;Truman Show&quot; and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;).
