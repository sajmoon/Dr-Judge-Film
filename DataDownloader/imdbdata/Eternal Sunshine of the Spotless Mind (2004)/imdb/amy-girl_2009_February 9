Joel (Jim Carey) and Clementine&#x27;s (Kate Winslet) romance comes to an
abrupt end after their two-year relationship turns sour. But they
haven&#x27;t had a usual break-up, because Joel soon discovers that
Clementine has had him erased from her memory. Devastated when he finds
out, Joel decides to have Clementine erased, too only to realise too
late that he doesn&#x27;t want to forget her. &#x27;Eternal sunshine&#x27; is a film
that demands second-time viewing. The beginning starts at the end, when
the opening credits roll 15 minutes later Joel is in a flood of tears
having just discovered that Clementine has erased him. Clem and Joel&#x27;s
relationship is shown in broken-up memories of fierce arguments and
loving moments. It follows a moral meaning about relationships and that
although they have their tough moments where you wish you&#x27;d never met,
you really do love them despite it all. Jim Carey&#x27;s performance in this
proves that he is not just a comedy actor like some people think, but
can actually do really brilliant performances in serious roles. Kate
Winslet was Oscar nominated for this, but it really should have been a
win as she plays the impulsive, fun, emotional Clementine flawlessly.
The Oscar this movie did win was best screenplay which was completely
deserved because although it is extremely complicated on first-time
viewing. You soon figure it all out and it all makes perfect sense.
&#x27;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind&#x27; cannot be missed; it is truly a
masterpiece you won&#x27;t forget. It is a film about relationships shown in
a very different way, but despite what some people say it is not only
for people who can relate, it is a film that will appeal to lots of
teenagers as I have proved. A definite must-see!!!
