This movie was a surprise. I never expected it to be as compelling as
it is. I don&#39;t really want to say too much about this work, because
until you&#39;ve seen it for yourself, I&#39;d hate to ruin it for you. Suffice
it to say that this has some wonderful darkling twists, coupled with
superb (not brilliant, but very well done) performances, and marvelous
direction. It lacks character development in the beginning, but you
find out why that is, soon enough. I was genuinely surprised by this
story and the execution of this production.<br /><br />It is WELL worth your time to check it out.<br /><br />It rates an 8.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
