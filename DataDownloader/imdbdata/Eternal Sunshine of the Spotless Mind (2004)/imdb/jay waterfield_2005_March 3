Eternal sunshine is a brilliantly original film. It's diversity sets it
aside from other films about love. Kate Winslet's performance is
fantastic and actually diverts your attention from her surprisingly bad
acting in Titanic. Jim Carey's performance shocked me incredibly, as
his stereotypical comedy roles gives the impression that comedy roles
is all he can do. This is without a dought Kirsten Dunst's best film to
date, however she and the other young actors let the were the only
thing that slightly let the film down. The story was funny, but also
very compelling. It is definitely a film to keep you happy, if you like
the humour present. The comedy is extremely funny. Granted, the jokes
are an acquired taste, like the film itself, but if you like original,
brilliently directed films, you'll love this.
