The chemistry between Jim Carey and Kate Winslet carries this film. It
may bore some but if your in the mood to be taken on a memento type
psychological journey then you are in for a treat. I came in cold in
terms of the storyline, just hearing that Joel played by Jim Carey was
crazy. This was great as I didn&#39;t know what to expect and that really
is how the story pans out. The cinematography is depressing New York in
winter and this really puts you in the mind of Joel. Watching this 4
years after is was filed, made no difference. This could be released
today as still receive acclaim. I only wish there were more movies this
original and executed so precisely..
