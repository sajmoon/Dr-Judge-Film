Some films reveal the inner workings of relationships that ring true
and leave clich&eacute; at the door - such as Eternal Sunshine ES. <br /><br />First, this is a well acted film, not the pet detective, or dark cable
guy Carey, but truly a serious performance by Carrey and Winslet. The
film explore the underbelly of relationships, the insecurities, as well
as those beautiful memories that are reminiscent of different romantic
- and serious moments in my emotional development. I watched the film
with my wife of 15 years, and the film had the same effect on each of
us.<br /><br />Compared to other films where figuring out which way is up due to a
lack of memory, such as Momento, this movie leaves the viewer with a
warm feeling about the human condition. I would recommend the film as a
date movie, for a couple in their early twenties or older.<br /><br />I would also recommend the film to science fiction film fans, who
appreciate seamless technologies into today's time line, without the
gloss and action of Total Recall - which uses a similar &quot;technology&quot; as
the driving force in the movie.<br /><br />Second, the ending of the movie may have been shorter if this was a
French film, leaving more to the imagination, but as in most American
movies, or versions of European productions, it seems we Americans need
to have things spelled out for us. But after the movie was completed,
the ending did make some points that were fairly key to the movie. But
this was not a movie with a sappy ending, either.
