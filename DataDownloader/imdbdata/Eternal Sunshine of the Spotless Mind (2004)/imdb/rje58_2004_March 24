If you can relate to the underlying theme of love longed for, love given and
received, and love lost, this is a great film. If you have come to
understand that acceptance can -sometimes- be a great thing and not a
compromise or a 'settle for' - this is a moving film.<br /><br />As crazy and almost surreal as elements of this film are, it somehow remains
honest and real. That seems like a contradiction... life is contradictory,
isn't it?<br /><br />Carrey and Winslet both turn in superb performances, as do the supporting
cast.  An incredible film that most of the people who 'get it' will love -
but I suspect there will be more than a small percentage who won't
understand it or can't relate to it and they will (understandably) dislike
it.
