Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a compelling and sentimental
alternative science fiction film that oozes style and is full of
artistic quality. Charlie Kaufman writes a totally original film that
beautifully expresses the point of not appreciating what you have until
it's gone. The idea of memory erasure has been done before but never
has a film gone to such great lengths to explore the sub conscious mind
as this film does.<br /><br />The direction of the film is inspiring. The way Joel's (Jim Carrey) sub
conscious intertwines with his past memories is so cleverly done and so
subtle, that it requires absolute attention from anyone watching. It is
always a sign of effective film making when an audience actually enjoys
been made to concentrate and this is a credit to Michel Gondry as
director. Gondry had a clear vision when making this film and I believe
he expressed it exactly how he wanted to.<br /><br />The element that helps Gondry realise his vision the most in Eternal
Sunshine are the performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Both have
proved themselves fine actors on many occasions but this could
certainly be a career best for both of them, especially Carrey. Carrey
successfully shook off his 'rubber face' typecast with The Truman Show
but he still played his roles rather over the top. This is possibly the
first time we have seen Jim Carrey in such an understated role and it
is refreshing to witness. His character in the real world is an average
guy you can see around every corner, yet in his mind, he is a desperate
man, passionate to keep hold of Clementine (Winslet). As she always is,
Winslet is terrific. Her character is so multi layered and challenging,
but Winslet copes with her role and shows why she is considered such a
good actress. Clementine is such a different character; she is
spontaneous, aggressive, loving, insecure, blunt&#133;. the list of
personality traits is endless which makes her such an interesting
character to watch.<br /><br />The scenes in the real world involving Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood,
Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson all do a fantastic job of raising the
question of ethics. Wood's involvement is clearly inappropriate and
Dunst and Ruffalo's behaviour is irresponsible and disrespectful. The
fact that Joel is oblivious to what is happening in his apartment
reflects the blind faith people have when they are been operated on or
being cared for. Dunst is very good in her role as a girl brainwashed
by Lacuna Inc.'s ideals, hiding a secret crush. Her turn at the end of
the film is very convincing and does a great job at conveying moral
dilemmas of such practices if they ever were to take place.<br /><br />The music complements the film tremendously. It adds to the surrealism
of what is going on and also does well to highlight the film's softer
moments. Even the song by Polyphonic Spree, who I can't stand, fits in
well within this film. Gondry puts a lot of effort in to maintaining
the atmosphere and does a lot of this through the score.<br /><br />One of the most thought provoking films there has been in a long time,
Eternal Sunshine is a truly great film, starring two truly great
actors. It might not be to everyone's taste but for the target
audience, the film is near perfect.
