&quot;Eternal Sunshine of Sporless M&Yacute;nd&quot; is one of the best movies i have
ever watched, since the characters in it are normal,everyday people
that you could see around, however the lifetime they are having is
completely extraordinary. Normally, I pick up a movie to watch after a
good search (Since i don't have enough time due to my work, i want the
movie to worth it. ), but this time i picked &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot;
randomly and i think i will keep choosing randomly after this movie.
The idea of forgetting some particular things, -actually erasing them
-is something we all wish from time to time and this movie has hell of
a job expressing this emotion of us. I advice anyone, who wishes having
that deletion of memories, to spend some time with this movie, it is
worthy.
