I've been a Kaufman fan since he was writing for television, and was
blown away by Malkovich, like most everyone was. <br /><br />It's truly shocking this movie is 200 places higher rated than either
Malkovich or Adaptation among IMDb users (#35 on the top 250, compared
to #208 and #235 respectively). I thought this movie was great, though
not as inventive as his prior work. Actually, this movie is probably
the most conventional movie Kaufman's written besides &quot;Confessions&quot;.<br /><br />Also, a shout out to those who think Spike Jones directed this,
actually Michel Gondry did. Gondry has given us better crafted movie
than Spike Jones has with Kaufman's scripts. This movie's full of fun
visual gags. Still, I'd love to see what how Kaufman's scripts panned
out if he ever paired up with a director that didn't come from the
music video generation. <br /><br />As far as performances go, the best aspect of this movie is Kate
Winslet. The character that Kaufman gave her is spectacular, and she is
awesome as usual. Carrey's character just mopes a lot. In the end,
Carrey's performance in this movie is nowhere near his performance
in.... ta-da... Cable Guy. Cable Guy is his best and most underrated
work. Carrey was born to do goofy faces and over the top characters,
why not appreciate the movies where he's at the top of his game? It's
not exactly a subtle performance, but since when is subtle always
better? Would we ask the Three Stooges to do Hamlet?
