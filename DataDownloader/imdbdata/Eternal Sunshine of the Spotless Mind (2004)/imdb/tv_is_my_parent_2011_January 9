I can&#x27;t describe this movie. I can&#x27;t this describe the plot but i have
to say this is one big masterpiece. <br /><br />I think the writer has one of the biggest brains in the world. And
Charlie Kaufman (writer) won an Academy Award. That is not a
coincidence.<br /><br />I must say I&#x27;m surprised to see Jim Carrey in a drama movie and he
fits. Kate Winslet is awesome like always but i think she should has
win an award. <br /><br />Long story short, this is a unique, sweet love story. This is in IMDb&#x27;s
Top 250. Rent and watch it. Some people find this confusing,
though.9/10.
