All I can say is that I never thought Jim Carrey can pull off such a
performance, simply brilliant. I always hated him and this movie
totally changed my mind about him...<br /><br />Now, the movie is a little complicated and starts off slow, I had it
for a while and every time I watched the first 15 mins, I fell asleep,
BUT, if you have patience and let it go through the story, you will be
amazed towards the end. It is simply one of the best love stories I
have ever seen without any cheesy Hollywood romance.<br /><br />To appreciate it best, need to watch it at least twice. The first time
I watched, I really liked it... then it was on Cable the other day and
after watching it again I was just blown away. If you have EVER been
truly in love, you can relate to everything in this movie. Characters
are real, stories are true, love is portrayed as it happens and it's
just an incredible story. It also has some science fiction mixed in
which doesn't take away from the story and actually adds to it.<br /><br />Totally recommended, among the top 5 movies of the last 2 years!
