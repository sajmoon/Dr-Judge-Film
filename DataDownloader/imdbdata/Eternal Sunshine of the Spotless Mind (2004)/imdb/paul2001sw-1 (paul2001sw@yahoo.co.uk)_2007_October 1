Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman wrote the wonderfully surreal &#39;Being John
Malkovich&#39;, and he&#39;s at it again in &#39;The Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind&#39;, a similarly bizarre tale. To classify (wholly unfairly)
it as genre, it&#39;s a romantic sci-fi (and how many of those do you
see?), set in a world where disillusioned lovers can have their
memories of each other erased. There&#39;s plenty of natural material in
this concept, but unfortunately, Kaufman and director Michel Gondry are
arguably guilty of trying a little too hard: the middle section of the
movie takes place inside the characters&#39; brains, for no real purpose in
terms of plot: the film fills this logical vacuum with some evocative
cinematography, but its impact is lessened because the film-makers have
first licensed themselves to show anything they want. What they do get
right, in combination with the leads, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett, is
to show real (positive and negative) chemistry between the
protagonists; if anything, at times they appear almost too adorable,
but at least there&#39;s a spark. And although daft, the film is wholly
watchable and actually not bad at manipulating the viewer&#39;s emotions;
but perhaps Kaufman didn&#39;t need to make his script jump through quite
so many hoops.
