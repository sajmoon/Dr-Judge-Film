This is one of the best movies ever..it&#39;s just so touching and i find
it quite helpful..i mean it helps ppl to see how important
relationships and especially the memories in the ppl we love or loved
are for us.J.C and K.W are just great in this movie,they really make u
believe it is a real story even though it&#39;s a s.f one...i know ppl that
didn&#39;t understand what the movie was about so they didn&#39;t really liked
it but i think that it&#39;s just because maybe it is a hard movie to watch
just like vanilla sky where u don&#39;t watch the movie for 1 sec u kind of
get lost in the action and u just don&#39;t understand what is
happening...i do not really agree whit ppl that say it is a romantic
comedy...it&#39;s more like a drama..but..whateva&#39;..all that matters it&#39;s
just that it is a great movie
