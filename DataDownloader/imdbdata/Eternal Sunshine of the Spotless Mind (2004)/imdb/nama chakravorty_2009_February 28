&#x27;Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind&#x27; is the best of the year 2004.
An amazing, outstanding film.. I loved the movie from start to end. A
remarkable film in each and every aspect. Two Thumbs WAY Up!<br /><br />Director - Brilliant. Script = Awesome. Overall = Masterpiece.<br /><br />Performances: Jim Carrey is my all-time favorite actor, He&#x27;s an amazing
actor. Kate Winslet is excellent. Tom Wilkinson is very good. Kristen
Dunst excels. Wood tries hard to leave a mark, but we are not over your
act in &#x27;LOTR&#x27; series. <br /><br />&#x27;Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind&#x27; is one of my all-time favorite
films . I love and adore this film. Don&#x27;t miss this one even in your
busiest movie day.
