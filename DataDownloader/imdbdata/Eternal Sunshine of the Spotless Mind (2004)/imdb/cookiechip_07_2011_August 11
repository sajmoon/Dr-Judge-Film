Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a finely balanced piece of
film making. The combination of imaginative screen play (by Charlie
Kaufman) and acute directing (by Michel Gondry) is one that produces an
original, thought-provoking love story. Narrated in a non-linear
fashion, we are hooked in straight away with the meeting of our two
leads; Joel Banish (Jim Carrey) is a shy, and despondent gentleman who
has no love or excitement in his life. Whilst going about his daily
routine of going to work, he randomly has a change of heart and without
a thought jumps on a train to Montuak. He is greeted by Clementine
Kyskovi (Kate Winslet) a free spirit who is driven by her impulses and
feelings. During the early exchanges they both play off each other, as
if to show opposites attracting by a chance meeting on a train journey.<br /><br />However after the credits, we re-join at the moment the couple are
coming to the end of their relationship and in doing so find out the
principle idea behind the films plot. The fascinating concept of being
able to erase parts of ones memory if they so desired, which is no
doubt the question you will be asking yourself long after the film&#x27;s
finale. So we watch our lead male undergo &#x27;surgery&#x27; as it were, a
sci-fi process which the director has portrayed skilfully and
realistically.<br /><br />As the story continues, dipping in and out of Joel consciousness, we
are never lost as the Director shoots in a timely manner with scenes
that are allowed time to breathe. There&#x27;s a charming moment that the
director has managed to transcend through the screen, and its when the
two protagonists are lying on ice looking up into the camera as if we
are the stars. What I like about the directing, is the fact that the
deep premise of ESSM could have easily been produced in the same
confusing manner much like &#x27;Momento &#x26; Inception&#x27;, however the team have
kept everything rather simplistic (in comparison) and this is i
believe, to its advantage.<br /><br />Jim Carrey in a serious role hits the mark and possibly because he is
restrained from being the funny guy, he suppress a lot of his
excitement and natural mad acts that it actually fits perfectly with
how Joels personality is meant to be perceived. Kate Winslet is a burst
of colourful energy that even though crazy at times, the audience and
Joel are always drawn back to her because of her likability and
infectious character. The supporting cast makes sure the film continues
the high standard throughout with performances by Tom Wilkingson,
Kirstin Dunst, Ellijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo.<br /><br />A key message that is portrayed during the film and that a lot of
people will relate to is the old clich&#xE9; &#x22;you don&#x27;t know what you go
till its gone&#x22; none more so then Joel, who fights to keep hold of the
cherished memories. Just as there are bad times there are good times
and its both experiences that define who we are. If we erased moments
in life, how would it define who we are today..? Some questions are
left unanswered and perhaps this is the way it should be; open to
interpretation, take from the movie what you will. Yet, what Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is however; is an emotionally powerful
near perfect story telling, one that you should not miss out on.
