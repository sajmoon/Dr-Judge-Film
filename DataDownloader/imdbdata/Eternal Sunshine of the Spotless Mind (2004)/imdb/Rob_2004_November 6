Great film, lots of layers engagingly constructed, but one aspect kept
annoying me: the make out scenes between the two Lacuna characters at
Joels' apartment. Does that add anything to the film. To me it is so
highly implausible, the guy getting brain work done and the two health
technicians frolicking and getting stoned...is that supposed to convey
that such treatment (in the future) will be totally routine or was it
inserted for some cheap laughs. I suspect the latter. <br /><br />Also, is Patrick's telephone call crucial to the film, it seems as
though that is the trigger for Joel to start protecting his memories.
If Patrick didn't take the call would we have had a film at all?
