By now, if you are unfamiliar with the name Charlie Kaufman (in other
words, if you have spent the last three years in outer space), that is
undoubtedly a damn shame. Charlie Kaufman is unquestionably one of the
most extraordinary and one of the (if not the) most inventive
screenwriters in the game today. His previous projects, including Being
John Malkovich and Adaptation, have broken cinematic formulas and
expectations alike, and in doing so, both have become modern-day
unparalleled masterworks. Fortunately, with his newest effort, Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kaufman does not fall far from the level
of innovation he emanated with his first two features. Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind is a strikingly original story that blends both
romance and memory loss like no other. It is yet another eccentric and
aesthetic tale from one of Hollywood's most gifted writers that all
will surely find sharp, fresh, and cognitive.<br /><br />Not only has Kaufman pieced together a pioneering screenplay on an
often-adapted subject matter, but he has also concocted an aptly named
title that has the power to place viewers in a state of surrealism and
wonderment right from the get-go. The title of the picture is taken
from a poem entitled &quot;Eloisa to Abelard&quot; by Alexander Pope. This
historic elegy, which Kaufman also used in Being John Malkovich,
directly refers to the human brain's power of recollection. Reminiscent
of both Memento and 50 First Dates, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind deals with the loss of memory; however, Kaufman's script gives the
frequently used topic an appetizing twist.<br /><br />On a train to Montauk, Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) happens to meet
Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), a candid yet electric woman, who
more-or-less seems like she could complete Joel in every way. The two
form a relationship, and establish many happy memories together. Even
so, in due time, their connection comes to a halt&#151;Clementine becomes
bored with Joel and Joel believes Clementine is too dependent.<br /><br />Immediately after the breakup, Clementine chooses to have Joel erased
from her memory. She travels to Lacuna Inc. &#150; a company that
specializes in the futuristic service of memory erasure &#150; to seek the
help of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson).<br /><br />Once Joel discovers that Clementine erased him from her head entirely,
he reports directly to Lacuna for the very same service. However, once
the Lacuna employees, Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and
Mary (Kirsten Dunst), start wiping out Clementine from Joel's mind,
their service becomes a disservice; Joel becomes contrite and changes
his mind about the procedure. Even though Joel is unconscious during
the entire attempted erasure, he consciously tries to retain the
memories of his love for Clementine within the walls of his own head,
and attempts to hang on to at least a fragment of what they once had.<br /><br />There is no question about it, this Jim Carrey's finest work. He brings
a clear spirited depth to the part of Joel&#151;making Joel Jim's most stark
yet most respectable character role to date. Even though Eternal
Sunshine may not be one of Jim biggest money making endeavors (compared
to his comedies), it certainly puts him on the path of being perceived
as an actor who is capable of seriousness. At far as earning an Oscar
nod for '04, because of the film's early release date and the fierce
competition up for the Best Actor nominations, Jim will most likely be
gypped.<br /><br />In addition to Carrey's career performance, the remainder of the
ensemble cast fares equally as well. Kate Winslet serves up some of her
best non English-accented acting as the orange-haired and sporadically
veclempt Clementine. (Sorry for the Yiddish slang.) Her work here is
arguably better than anything else she has done&#151;with the possible
exception of her other near-astounding 2004 effort in Finding
Neverland. Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are as faultless as always,
and both Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood are as top-notch as expected in
their respective supporting roles.<br /><br />With his superb use of light (or more appropriately darkness) and his
watertight scene transitions, director Michel Gondry has crafted an
utter joy of a film that cleverly starts out near the end and then
wraps back upon itself by the conclusion. Overall, the quirky yet
visual genius of Gondry combined with the warped yet brilliant mind of
Charlie Kaufman has undoubtedly resulted in a beautiful and poignant
romance. The manner in which Eternal Sunshine blends its romance and
comedy gives the film a strong sense of undeniable individuality and
makes for an overtly pleasing picture. Eternal Sunshine has the
aptitude to tickle your thinking cap, sooth your sight, and hypnotize
your heart. Beyond any shadow of a doubt, Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind belongs in the absolute upper echelon of all that is
romantic and unique.
