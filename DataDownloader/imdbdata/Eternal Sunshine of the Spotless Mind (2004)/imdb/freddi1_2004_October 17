There is not much to criticize on this movie (I rated it 9/10), so here
are my two cents:<br /><br />a) A+ story from the man who wrote &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. The story is
not &quot;easy&quot; (&quot;like poor underdog gets great girl in the end and they
live happily thereafter&quot;), but if you keep up and follow the story, its
great. Its realistic, its fun, its never too technical (the movie
actually is about brain surgery here!) ... good mixture of everything!<br /><br />b) The cast ... if you wanna see a great main actor couple, go watch
this one, Carrey and Winslet are amazing. They are on a completely
different level than Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst, its hard to believe
that this is Mr Ace Ventura and Cable Guy together with Titanic woman
(I know, both did great movies since then, I'm just pointing out their
origins). Carrey will never lose his little craziness, but as this
movie showed, he is capable of much much more. When you see him
together with Kate Winslet as &quot;the couple&quot;, you doubt nothing they do
or say: They ARE Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski! Affleck, watch
this and see how its done!!<br /><br />c) Visual Effects: As this is a more serious (but still funny!) movie,
there is no place for alien blasters, explosions or space ships ... but
that doesn't mean that producers do not try to fit in as much FX as
possible (I'm not judging, I LOVE Michael Bay's Bad Boys :-)) But not
in this movie, the crew showed great respect to the storyline but
managed to fit in little gimmicks that help the viewer develop its view
on the characters. At no time of the movie you get the feeling like
&quot;ahhh thats sooooo unrealistic&quot; or &quot;nahhh take it away that doesn't
fit!) ... from minute 1 you are more like &quot;hmmm, actually this could
happen in the apartment above me!&quot; and &quot;great idea, that a FX that adds
an unforeseeable fun element&quot;. The changes of point of view (inside
Carrey real, inside Carrey dream, out of Carrey) lets the viewer
explore the characters and their surroundings without things getting
overwhelming (side story lines ...).
