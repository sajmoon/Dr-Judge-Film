I just watched the movie and I had to get to my computer to see what
others said. This is one of those movies that will float around inside
your head for days. I wont give anything away, but I was really having
a hard time understanding the movie until the last 20 minutes or so,
but then it all came together and it was simply brilliant. Like
standing in front of one of those 3d posters blurring your eyes until
finally the object you know is there magically appears. I don't know if
anyone else noticed a similarity to the movie &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; starring
Tim Robbins, but it did have some of that feel. I will definitely watch
this movie again. A masterpiece.
