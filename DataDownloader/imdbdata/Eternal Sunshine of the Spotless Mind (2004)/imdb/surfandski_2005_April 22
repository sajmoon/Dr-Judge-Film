You have to give it to Charlie Kauffman, his scripts are very, very
original, almost as if he is trying to outsmart himself (Adaptation,
Being John Malkovic, and now Sunshine...), however they always have
this quality of leaving you a bit empty, because he always starts so
strong maybe his endings lose a lot of the punch, or he just does not
want to deliver one. In any case, this is a good movie. The acting is
superb, Carey and Whinslet have a perfect chemistry here, and although
not much is shown, much is perceived. I think that looking at 50% of
the audience giving this movie a 10 is overrating it. What are you
going to leave for the Godfather, or the Quiet American? 7/10
