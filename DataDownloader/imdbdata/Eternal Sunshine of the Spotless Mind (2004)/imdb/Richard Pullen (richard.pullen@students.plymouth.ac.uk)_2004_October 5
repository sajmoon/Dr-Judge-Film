Yet another film scribed by the god of modern screen writing Charlie
Kaufman ('Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', Adaptation.', 'Human
Nature' &amp; 'Being John Malkovich'), you wonder what goes on it that
brain of his!<br /><br />Gondry masterminds a crazy bit of cinema that weaves around not just
the characters brain but your own! I think I'd have given this film 10
out of 10 if I'd fully understood but hey my brain was obviously not to
the task that evening!<br /><br />Carrey has proved YET AGAIN he is up to less &quot;Allllllllllllrighty Then&quot;
roles, &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, &quot;The Man on the Moon&quot;, (to a lesser extend)
&quot;The Majestic&quot; all are example of this... When will the world recognise
this totally?<br /><br />Winslet, Wilkinson, Dunst, Wood, Ruffalo are prove a great cast.<br /><br />WATCH-THIS-FILM.... With a clear mind!
