This film twists you brain and make you cry. The move is drama, love
story and sci-fi. Don't go and se this move for the sci-fi part, sci-fi
fans for then you got scrod. It's about really live thatisn't so easy
all the time but you can get try it if you help each order. Don't think
Jim Carry can't do anything else than comedy for here he has proved
you're wrong big time. It's very deep a great love story. Perfect
acting from Jim and Kate, a bit to match flashing from there to there
in the love story but overall a great move. If you want your women to
cry go and look this up at the cinema and don't forget paper. I almost
needed paper to weep tears from my ayes 'and for love of god I'm a
man'. What more can I say you have to se it to understand it! Ps. Sorry
if my English isn't so good. -Jankki-
