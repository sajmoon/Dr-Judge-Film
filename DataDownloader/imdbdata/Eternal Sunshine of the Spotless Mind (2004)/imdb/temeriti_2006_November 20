&#39;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#39; is one of those movies that I
thought about seeing, half wanted to see, but never did see until now.
I&#39;m very glad I finally did.<br /><br />From the first scene in the movie to the last, you&#39;re constantly
sitting there wondering, &quot;What the hell?&quot; It&#39;s an extremely bizarre
movie, completely unlike any other I&#39;ve seen before. Jim Carrey and
Kate Winslet have outstanding chemistry, and though drama generally
isn&#39;t Carrey&#39;s forte, he pulls it off big time here.<br /><br />Beginning to end, this film will make you laugh, cry, frown, squint,
and wonder what the heck is going on. But you&#39;ll enjoy every minute of
it.
