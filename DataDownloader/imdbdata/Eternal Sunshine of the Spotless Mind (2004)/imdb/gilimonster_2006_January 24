I loved this movie so much. It is not the type of thing I would
normally watch but I was on a cruise and it was late at night with no
activities and this was the only thing on. Needless to say, I was
completely blown away. I had never really seen Jim Carey in anything
except his movies like dumb and dumber and i thought he surprised me
with his performance here. I was expecting just another love movie but
trust me, it's much more than that. It's story is complicated and
overall good. The ending was a little sad, but i like that it didn't
have a clich&eacute; Hollywood ending were everyone lives happily ever after,
without giving it away the ending is open to interpretation. So in
conclusion GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
