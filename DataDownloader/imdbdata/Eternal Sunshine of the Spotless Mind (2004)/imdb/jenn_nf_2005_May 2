I just want to say that I'm a pretty average guy, who doesn't get too
emotional about stuff. But this movie really affected me. It was so
well written and performed that I couldn't help but be moved by the
struggle of Jim Carey's character to keep the memories of his
Clementine. A good movie should entertain, and a great movie should
make you think and reflect on your own life while entertaining you.
Eternal Sunshine forced me to examine my own relationship and made me
appreciate the ups and downs of our lives. The cinematography, the
score, everything worked beautifully in this film. This is probably my
favorite movie of 2004.
