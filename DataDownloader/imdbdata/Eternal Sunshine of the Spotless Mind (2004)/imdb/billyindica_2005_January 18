This movie was like a blend of science fiction and love, which are my
two favorite subjects.. Jim Carrey brought something very new for him
to the table, showing his true versatility. Carrey broke away from his
traditional silly, and outgoing nature in films, to play a shy and
quiet guy named &quot;Joel&quot;, Elijah Woods also was a big part of this film..
a stunning performance by Kate Winslet as &quot;Clementine&quot; only added to
the master piece of Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind... The name
alone drew me in, and after i saw that Jim Carrey was in it, I had to
give it a peep.. Trust Me, movies don't get that much better, this is
very entertaining...Loved it, and highly recommend it.. 9/10
