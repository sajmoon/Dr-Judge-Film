2004_October 6 

I'm a movie lover and I own 1000s of DVDs from all eras, so I like to
think I have an eye for a really great movie... So why am I scratching
my head after watching this and seeing over 49% of 12,000 voters giving
this a 10? I just don't get it.<br /><br />To be honest, I found the movie pretty average. It has some great
acting by Winslet and Carrey and the soundtrack is quite enchanting. I
suppose the storyline does touch the emotional nerves of anyone who has
been in love and felt pain from it, but nothing I haven't seen done
better in other (mostly &quot;World Cinema&quot;) movies. The direction and style
of the movie is nothing revolutionary (contradicting a point raised
quite often here).<br /><br />I was wondering was it something to do with the general reviews of the
film? One trend I've found on IMDb is that the vast majority of people
tend to echo what reviews have said about a film, even if they (deep
down) don't feel that way themselves about it? I'm not sure, I tend not
to read reviews until after I've watched a film.<br /><br />I gave the film 6/10 as I was feeling generous. It really doesn't
deserve anything more than this.
