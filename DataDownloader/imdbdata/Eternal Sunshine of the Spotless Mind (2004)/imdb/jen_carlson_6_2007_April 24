Amazing film that has changed and shaped my life. Highly recommended.
The impact of Winslet and Carry&#39;s performances is completely
unforgettable. If people have been through any sort of rift in a
relationship they will completely understand the film. Though I am sure
there are people who don&#39;t and with that in mind cannot fully
comprehend the movie. Kaufman is brilliant. The scenes shot in New York
(especially Grand Central) are amazing, and accurate. Montauk in the
winter is completely isolated. Everything was done correctly in this
film which is a relief. As well the film has a great soundtrack with
very diverse music. I love this film.
