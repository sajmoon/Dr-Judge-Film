What if your girl (by some kind of technical advances) would erase you
from her mind? What if you (in revenge) would do the same? This is the
starting point for a crazy story made by french director Michekl Condry
and co-written with by Charlie Kaufman (they had previously worked
together in that disaster called &quot;Human Nature&quot;). As in most o
Kaufman's scripts you can't figure out if it is such a complex and
perfect engine or only some pages stapled at random. Anyway, this time
he made it! The moral is quite clear: nobody's perfect, nor even the
love of your life. Her/his defects are his/her virtues as well; and if
you kill your couple in your head you're killing yourself too. When
relationships get so intense then your couple is part of you and you're
part of your couple.<br /><br />Kaufman and Gondry make us quickly identify with the main character as
his memories are being erased (and with them his own world, his present
and his future). They force us to fall in love with the girlfriend,
played by the so inspired (and beautiful) Kate Winslet; they let us
understand why that man is in love with that woman, how does it hurt to
lose her, and how impossible is to try to replace your soul-mate. Jim
Carrey, the long-suffering boyfriend, plays his most sober and austere
character, it seems like it is a part specially written for him (though
it is a dramatic character, he needs to resort to that hysterical clown
inside him in a few sequences). Guest-starrings are not that bad , but
they're nothing but filling (Hollywood stars-filling: Dunst, Wood...).<br /><br />So &quot;Eternal Sunshine...&quot; is quite confusing, the sense of narration is
completely lost here (as in most of Kaufman's works). But that's why it
is so amusing. Because of its nonsense, because of the absurd of it
all: the laughing, the tenderness, the tears... No one will be
indifferent about this movie: some will disconnect after 5 minutes, and
some will ask for more and more, even though they now exactly how the
story is gonna end. A little jewel from latest (almost)independant
American cinema.<br /><br />PD: Three hurrays for Spanish movies titles translators. They called
this movie &quot;Forget About Me&quot;... That's it boys! In your face! (God, do
they REALLY get paid for doing that?) *My rate: 7.5/10
