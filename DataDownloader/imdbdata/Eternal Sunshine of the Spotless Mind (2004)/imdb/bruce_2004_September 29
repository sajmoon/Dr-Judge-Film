look I rated this movie a ten, and deservedly, but it does bother me
just a little that the main characters would be quite so willing to
trust someone fairly unknown with erasing their brains... <br /><br />I don't get enough info in the film, as to why this organization is so
trustworthy in the eyes of the main characters.... and after you get
into the film... well things seem even more... you know<br /><br />i don't want to give the story away, so I can't say more...<br /><br />but watch it, don't you agree?<br /><br />other than that, I really enjoyed the film, and would recommend it to
anyone who has an open mind and a romantic heart... some things harder
to find nowadays!
