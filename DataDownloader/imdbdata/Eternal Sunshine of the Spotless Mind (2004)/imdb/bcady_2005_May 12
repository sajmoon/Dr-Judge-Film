The only redeeming thing about this film was the acting. Unfortunately,
most of the actors do a little too good a job convincing you how
pathetic their characters can be. I do not need to watch shallow people
at their shallowest to make me feel deep. I haven't seen such self
indulgent tripe aimed at wannabe intellectuals since Lost in
Translation came out.<br /><br />Anyone who gave this film a nine or ten needs to spend a little more
time at small theaters that play independent, documentary, foreign, and
art house films so they know the difference. If you happen to live in
the south Puget Sound area you should check out the Tacoma Grand
Cinema.
