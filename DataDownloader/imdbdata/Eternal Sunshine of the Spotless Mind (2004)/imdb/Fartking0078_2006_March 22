Jim Carrey has changed into a dramatic yet romantic character. Movie
may be confusing first or second time watching but soon you may catch
on to the order of time that things happened. Good story, good movie.
Can compare characters to real life people. I've watched it many times
and still enjoy it, I'm soon going to watch it together with my fianc&eacute;
on her birthday. Good movie for couples who have broken up and reunited
later, you may be able to compare these characters to how you were
before. I also thought it was great they took the title of the movie
from the line of a poem that also fits with the story of the movie. Two
thumps up.
