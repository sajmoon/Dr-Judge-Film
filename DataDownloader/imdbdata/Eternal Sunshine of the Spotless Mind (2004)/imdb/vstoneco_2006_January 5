This isn't really a movie review. It's more a reaction. After watching
this movie, I feel like running around screaming, &quot;You're missing the
point! You're missing the point!&quot; Perhaps I'm missing the point. The
film gets kudos for being clever and quirky and well-filmed, in a Being
John Malkovich kind of way. Clever, quirky, but there's a spiritual
barrenness underlying it. Shouldn't art be more than clever? Shouldn't
it reach deeper? Limericks are clever &#150; we don't call them art. The
underlying message in Eternal Sunshine isn't all that original. I am
tired of seeing movies about love and loneliness. How many movies have
we all seen whose basic point is that if you just reach out, take a
chance, find romance, this will fend off the ravening wolves of
loneliness at the door of modern life? <br /><br />In a culture that desperately needs a sense of community and
connection, peddling movies and songs about romance is like giving
cotton candy to a starving person.<br /><br />It isn't what we need! Finding romance is not the way to fend off
loneliness and alienation, a change in the culture is. If we all felt
connected to something that mattered, to other living things, to
communities we cared about, romances wouldn't be the be-all and end-all
of meaningful existence, it would be just one among many of life's
joys.
