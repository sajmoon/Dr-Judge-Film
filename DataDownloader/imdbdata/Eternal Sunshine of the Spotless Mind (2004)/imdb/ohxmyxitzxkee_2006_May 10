When this film first came out in 2003, I wasn&#39;t really that drawn to
it. I saw the film and was a little confused. But when I watched it
carefully on DVD, I saw the sly magical performances given by all the
actors.<br /><br />First off, Jim Carrey gave one of his best performances. He was
completely overlooked throughout award season. His performance as the
depressed, unlivable Joel Barrish was so dignified. It&#39;s great to see
an comedic actor try something different and succeed.<br /><br />Second, Kate Winslet is phenomenal. She creates a corky but intelligent
heroine who stole the film. I loved every single one of her scenes.
Winslet played against-the-type as Clementine Kruczynski and is
magnificent to watch. Definitely one of the most memorable characters
I&#39;ve ever seen.<br /><br />With that said, all the other actors were great as well. It&#39;s
definitely one of the great modern day films and one of the best
screenplays.
