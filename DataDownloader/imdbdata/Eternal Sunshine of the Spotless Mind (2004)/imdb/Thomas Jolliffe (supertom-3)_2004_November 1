From hot screenwriter of the moment, Charlie Kaufman comes this
superbly quirky and unique comedy/romance. It's a strange blend of
humour and drama with a science fiction premise. Basically after he
breaks up with his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet), Joel (Jim
Carrey) finds out that he has been erased from her memory by the lacuna
corporation. It's a technique that puts patients into a dream as the
relive memories of what they want erased and as they relive them they
are wiped out. Joel then decides that he wants the procedure because
the pain is too much.<br /><br />Kaufmans script is superbly imaginative, if far fetched and combined
with the imaginative visual stamp from director Michel Gondry (whose
music video background really helps) the film is highly unique. <br /><br />This film also has to be the one that gets Jim Carrey an Oscar
nomination. This is by far his best performance it is so subtle and
restrained with real pathos that he completely encompasses the
character and as such there isn't a hint of Carrey being Carrey. There
is no mugging or face pulling of any sort, no flailing of limbs at all.
It is a masterful performance of restraint and real accomplishment.
Kate Winslet similarly movies away from her image of Kate Winslet as
the effervescent Clementine. She is equally superb. She really does
portray the quirkiness of Clementine's personality superbly. There is
also great support from Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffulo, Kirsten Dunst and
Tom Wilkinson. <br /><br />This really is a film that is so far from your typical Hollywood
romance that it is immensely enjoyable and simplistic. The plot on
occasion near convulsion but it comes clear excellently and the way the
beginning links with the end is great stuff. ****1/2
