Let me get this off my chest: this movie is NOT perfect. It starts off
with a lot of stuff that seems more at home in a pretentious film
school project than a Charlie Kaufman flick. I didn&#39;t know it was the
great Kaufman who had written the script, and for the first 15 minutes
or so, I sat there wondering if the writer and director were George
Lucas&#39; kids or something, given a bunch of money to make a big-name
vanity movie, a la &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;.<br /><br />Well, if I were to watch the movie again now, I&#39;d understand that vague
beginning, because the film really IS beautifully crafted, heartwarming
and true to the concepts of love. But it takes a while to get that.
Compared to the other Kaufman flicks I&#39;ve seen (Human Nature, Being
John Malkovich) it fails in that respect: it doesn&#39;t convince me that
the wackiness is worth it from the get-go. I could have turned this
movie off in annoyance that the movie was trying to hide Elijah Wood
from me so ineptly (when in fact, I DIDN&#39;T know what the movie was
trying to hide after all). I would have missed a good movie experience.
