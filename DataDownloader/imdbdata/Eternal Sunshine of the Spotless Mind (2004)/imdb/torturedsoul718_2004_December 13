I just seen Eternal Sunshine of blah blah blah, when I started to
wonder if I would ever see a Charlie Kaufman movie that didn't bore me
to the point of wanting to rip out my own eyes. The guy has no talent.
Put the pen down and step away from your typewriter, you are under
arrest for attempted murder, this movie almost killed me to watch! And
Jim Carrey should stick to comedy, don't ruin your career over this
douche, it's just not worth it. To sum up, story sucked, concept
sucked, acting sucked, direction sucked, lighting sucked, the boom mic
guy sucked, etc... Don't waste your time with this wannabe-film and
pick up something more entertaining that wasn't written by Kaufman,
you'll thank me later. Rating: -10 out of 4 stars.<br /><br />-Sometimes it's appropriate to swear. -Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth? -I do...You bastard.
