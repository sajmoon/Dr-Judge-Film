Jim Carrey is known for his roles in screwball comedies, and it seemed
as there was no way to get an actual clean break off from his normal
goofy persona. It may have seemed that way, but this movie proves
otherwise. What we have here is a mature film, with some funny moments,
but instead of a stupid Carrey performance, we have a deep and moving
performance, in a very strange and original, but nonetheless deep and
moving picture. <br /><br />Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) leads a fairly mundane and boring life until
he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet). He and Clementine click right away
despite their contrasting personalities. One day when visiting her and
work, Joel finds she has no recollection of him, and discovers she had
her memory erased of him from a clinic. Because of his depression over
her, Joel decides to do the same thing. During the procedure, Joel
realizes he wants to remember her, and must take her to places in his
memory where she can&#x27;t be erased. Meanwhile, during the operation at
Joel&#x27;s apartment, we meet the doctors working on him. Stan (Mark
Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) are the somewhat incompetent
doctors, as they care about their own needs more than that of Joel, and
Stan ends up inviting over Mary (Kirstin Dunst), the receptionist at
their place of work. Joel jumps from memory to memory causing confusion
by the younger doctors and a call to older Doctor Howard (Tom
WIlkinsin) and secrets about the people performing the operations come
out.<br /><br />For a movie that takes place mainly inside one guy&#x27;s mind, this manages
to be a very emotional film. Joel is a really likable character, and
his progression throughout the film and in his memories is quite
interesting. Kate Winslet plays a good opposite to Joel&#x27;s introverted
ways, and her performance as Clementine, and as merely a memory
concocted by Joel is also excellent. All the performances are great,
and what makes them great, is despite some stupidity even in the
doctors, they&#x27;re still portrayed as people, not just morons. They are
just as deep as our protagonist, and have just as much baggage on the
brain.<br /><br />The direction is phenomenal. The jump from memory to memory and the
erasing of the memories gives us a huge feel of what Joel has gone
through and takes us through all kind of interesting settings. In
contrast, we have Joel&#x27;s apartment where our co-plot is going on with
the doctors, and the apartment in so many scenes gives a feeling of
intimacy with the surroundings. The memories Joel has are so well done
and even eerie at times, but also very sad and lonely when need be.
Director Michael Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman really molded
some brilliant contrasts, and some lovely and thought provoking
characters.<br /><br />Overall, this really is destined to be a classic, or if not that a
highly regarded cult classic. It&#x27;s an emotional, beautiful movie, with
Jim Carrey showing that he deserves more roles in dramas after pulling
this off. Nothing&#x27;s ever been quite like this, and chances are, nothing
will again.<br /><br />My rating: **** out of ****. 108 mins. R for language and sexuality.
