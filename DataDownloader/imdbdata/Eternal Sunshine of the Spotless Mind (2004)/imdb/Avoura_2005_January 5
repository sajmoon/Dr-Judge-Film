I agree with what John Ulmer wrote in his review on this website. I
cannot say much more. This was a fantastic experience that most people
would miss out on, as they are unwilling to try something new. This is
certainly new and exciting and unusual.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like was the swearing. If the swearing were
cut out then it would be much better. I only rate it a 9 because of
that, otherwise it would be a 10.<br /><br />And, when I saw the beginning, not much made sense, until I watched
through to the end and it all made sense. So if you start watching this
and are thinking it does not make sense, then watch through to the end,
and maybe see it again. I plan to watch this again.
