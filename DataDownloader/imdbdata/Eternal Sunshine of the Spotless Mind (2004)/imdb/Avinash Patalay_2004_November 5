A thought provoking film so very convincing that makes you believe that
the technological advancement might see the memory erasure concept
light of the day. <br /><br />Boy meets girl - fall in love hopelessly (that is Jim Carrey and Kate
Winslet). They love being in each others company and have ball of time
together. After a while the relationship turn sour to the extent that
the Kate walks out of relationship, while Jim still latches on.<br /><br />Jim discovers that Kate has undergone the process of memory erasure to
remove all the traces of Jim in her mind. In anger Jim decides to go in
for the same. What follows is an insight into the Jim's mind and the
process of memory erasure. The relationship of Jim and Kate is depicted
backward (obviously - removing the latest memory first and moving back
to the root!) and how each bit is removed one by one. As it progresses
further, Jim discovers that he is undergoing erasure process and
regrets it. Now he tries to evade removal of Kate from his memory,
which was hilarious in my personal opinion.<br /><br />Its also worth mentioning the way memory erasure is depited on screen
which is quite convincing. <br /><br />Jim Carrey is fantastic and his performance is worth mentioning. Kate
lives to her character of being impulsive. Elijah Wood character was
manipulative and fetish but okay. I was expecting more depth to Kirsten
Dunst's character. Wilkinson was okay. <br /><br />After you have erased someone from the memory, what if you bump into
the person you loved? How would you cope if you discover that you have
undergone memory erasure process? And most important - given a chance
to re-live the same situation will it lead to the same circumstances?
Watch it - and it echoes in your mind for a long time to come. 9/10<br /><br />How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the
world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r
accepted, and each wish resign'd
