Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett star in this unique film, as two people
who meet and slowly fall in love. However the relationship is somewhat
rocky, and slowly begins to deteriorate. After one particularly nasty
row, Winslett decides to have Carrey erased from her memory.<br /><br />Amazingly it turns out that there exists a procedure that allows her to
do just that, even though everything else points to the film being set
in the present day. The futuristic machines that facilitate Carrey and
Winslett's memory loss seem somewhat out of place in this thoughtful
drama about the pitfalls of relationships, and the film seems intent on
enlightening us about how the memory-wiping technology works. Better
they had glossed over this, and allowed it to remain a mystery.<br /><br />The film also devotes some time to examining the lives of the people
who carry out the procedure, who to be honest are pretty incidental to
the main plot. These sections aren't particularly enlightening, as they
just seem to mirror the problems that Carrey and Winslett are
experiencing.<br /><br />Carrey is a revelation in this film, showing that he is capable of far
more than just energetic mugging in dubious comedy vehicles, and gets
his career firmly back on track, while Winslett finally puts Titanic
behind her, delivering an assured performance.<br /><br />Overall this is a thoroughly absorbing and original work, which invokes
bizarre technology, and is so bonkers at times that you occasionally
forget that it's basically a simple film about relationships. It's
superbly thought provoking, and only slightly marred by its tendency
towards science fiction.
