this is my favorite movie of 2004 and definitely one of the top in my
all-time favorite lists! <br /><br />Eternal touched a certain part of you, your heart that most shows never
did. or rather could never did. it shows the fragility of a
relationship. people want to erase bad memories of a failed
relationship yet at the same time, cant bear to part with the good
ones! how so can that be done? how can you erase bad memories and saved
good ones only? Carrey and Winslet did a perfect job acting as Joel and
Clementine respectively. Arguably one of their career best so far. its
a pleasant surprise to see the man behind &quot;The Mask&quot; playing such a
quiet and introvert role. Kate, on the other hand, brought Clementine
to new heights as the bubbly and brutally honest lass who you love and
hate.<br /><br />Eternal is a definite marvel, a feat in itself. its rich and flamboyant
yet fragile. it brings the audience to such a personal level it hurts.
especially when both cant seem to escape from the erasure.<br /><br />well-done!
