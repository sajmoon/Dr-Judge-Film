Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a clever, imaginative and
bizarre movie. Basically the story is Josh(Jim Carey) wakes up like any
other day. Instead of going to work Josh jumps on a train where he
meets Clementine(Kate Winslett). At first Josh is quiet and shy and
cannot start a conversation. Clementine makes the first move and from
there on the relationship blossoms and they fall in love. After they
knew each other for a while Clementine is behaving strangely towards
Josh. She cannot remember who he is, because her memory of Josh has
been erased. When Josh knows what she has done he is very cross and
angry. So Josh decides to go to the same doctor and have her memory
erased from his brain. The next part of the movie is very strange and
weird. I'ts hard to figure out what is happening.<br /><br />It grabs you right away and sends you on an amazing journey through the
memories of Josh. It has so many twists and turns especially when
Clementine is talking to Josh and suddenly vanishes. This happens
several times. The reason is Josh is slowly erasing Clementine from his
brain and these memories actually happened in reality but now gone
forever. Josh wants to keep the memories when they were in love and
remember the good times they shared together, but he cannot because all
around him. The scenery is disappearing and gone forever in his mind.
When Josh has finally erased Clementine. He finds her and tries to
begin their relationship again. At first she does not come to terms
straight away. Josh persuades her that we had good times together and
we can start a fresh. Clementine and Josh make up and can start their
lives together in the real world. I would recommend you watch this
movie, it is uplifting, unique and different from most films you would
enjoy.<br /><br />I would recommend 'Mulholland Drive' &amp; 'Donnie Darko' both these films
are similar to 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'.
