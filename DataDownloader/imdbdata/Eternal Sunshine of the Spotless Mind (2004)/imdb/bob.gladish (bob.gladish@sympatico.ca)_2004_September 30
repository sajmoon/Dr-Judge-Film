2004_September 30 

I can see the majority of casual moviegoers not liking this movie, as
it's a little oddball in the early going, and difficult to get used to;
but even those who can only appreciate conventional Hollywood pap will
probably be won over by this one.... if they give themselves a chance
to get into it. The second half of this movie is an absolute delight -
I love the way the story unfolds. The interaction of the cast, the
sheer buoyance of the script, and the nice ending completely won me
over. Jim Carrey deserves an Oscar nomination, as he entirely abandons
his usual goofy persona. Mark Ruffalo is beginning to really impress me
with the scope of his abilities. This is basically a six-character
ensemble cast, and man, do they ever rock with this script! &quot;Oscar&quot; is
written all over this one, especially for Charlie Kaufman.
