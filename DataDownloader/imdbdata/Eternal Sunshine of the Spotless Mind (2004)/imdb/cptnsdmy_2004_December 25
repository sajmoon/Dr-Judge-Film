Quite how they came up with I'll never know, but I would like to meet
their dealer. Jim has now proved he is Oscar-worthy and many who have
seen the film would have already given him their vote. His role is
played with such stark emotion that it's difficult to fathom how he
managed to invoke the frame of mind I imagine must have been required.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is also apparent as something I could never her being. Her
part is overflowing with feeling and heart, while at the same time
exuding a gritty realism that makes her interplay with Jim's character
that much more intense.<br /><br />The storyline is related with perfect structure and the gradual slope
approaches the ending with meaningful delivery.<br /><br />The film is technically perfect and cannot be faulted in any other way.<br /><br />...
