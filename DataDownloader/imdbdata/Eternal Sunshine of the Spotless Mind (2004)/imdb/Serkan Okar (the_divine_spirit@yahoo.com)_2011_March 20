Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a rare movie with an
intelligent script that studies the pain of romantic relationships and
breakups. It&#x27;s quite philosophical and requires thinking. The editing
and storytelling styles are unusual which could be challenging to some
viewers.<br /><br />In order to understand some of the philosophical ideas behind the
script, one needs to be familiar with existentialist philosophy and the
ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who pioneered
existentialist philosophy. Nietzsche believed that pain is essential to
human experience. People should not numb their pain. Instead people
should use their pain to cultivate their character. He likened the pain
to the roots of a plant; the deeper they go, stronger the plant will
be. In short, pain builds character.<br /><br />The other concept of Nietszche that stood out to me in the screenplay
is the eternal recurrence of events. Nietzsche suggested that events in
the universe could be repeating themselves in endless cycle which he
called &#x22;eternal recurrence&#x22;. Charlie Kaufman probably named the title
of the screenplay after this concept. We all know that he knows about
Nietzsche as he is quoted a couple of times in the movie (the lines
from &#x22;Beyond Good and Evil).<br /><br />The other existentialist concept is the world is what you make of it.
It is how you see it and it matters more how you see it than it being
an independent reality. If someone erases you from their memory, that
doesn&#x27;t take anything away from the goodness of memories themselves. If
they mean so much to you and still a part of you then that&#x27;s all it
matters. Well enough with the philosophy...<br /><br />This is the story of romantic couple, Clementine (Kate Winslet) and
Joel (Jim Carrey), who go through a breakup. Joel finds out that
Clementine had a procedure done to erase all memories of him and their
relationship. He decides to go through the same procedure and remove
her from his memory. However, during the procedure he comes to a
realization. This realization is the wisdom of the movie. It offers a
great message inspired by the aforementioned philosophical ideas.<br /><br />I think Eternal Sunshine is a great movie and a rare cinematic art. If
you love literature, philosophy and intelligent film-making, the
chances are you will like Eternal Sunshine.
