The title says it all.This movie has Jim Carrey written all over
it.&#x27;Eternal Sunshine&#x27; shows Jim Carrey play an altogether different
character which you may have never seen before.The acting by Kate
Winslet is simply brilliant no wonder she received an Academy award
nomination.The elements of the film are very well put together having
many funny and quite bizarre moments.<br /><br />Kudos to the writing department who put up such a brilliant script so
that the actors get enough screen time to display their on screen
brilliance. Definitely a big milestone in film making.&#x27;Eternal Sunshine
of the spotless mind&#x27; is surely not to be missed.
