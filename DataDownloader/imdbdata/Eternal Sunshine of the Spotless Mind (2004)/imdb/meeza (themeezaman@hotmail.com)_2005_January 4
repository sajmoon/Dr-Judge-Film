I am eternally grateful that I am in the conscientious state of mind to
review the phenomenon of an avant-guarde film that is &quot;Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind&quot;. Not even the memory erasers of Lacuna can wipe
my retrospection of this grand pelicula. Wait a second! What is
happening? the Lacuna memory-wipers have snatched me! There has been a
misunderstanding! I said i did not want this procedure done to me,
Lacuna! Do not do this! What I meant is that people who are trepidated
by &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; are being babies and they
belong in &quot;la cuna&quot;! Help meeeeee! <br /><br />Joel (Meeza) Memory Erasing Phase #1: This innovative flick stars Jim
Carrey as (man, what was his name in the movie? I think it had
something to do with me!) Oh yes! His name is Joel! Man, that is my
name! Joel is timid &amp; sequestered (not me!), he drives a gray Toyota
(me!), and wants to erase the memory of his last romantic relationship
from his mind (always me! except the sex scenes! might need those for
future self-help exercises!) <br /><br />Joel (Meeza) Memory Erasing Phase #2: That Titanic actress with those
titillating tits co-stars as Clementine. Oh my darling, Clementime!
What is her name? I can't &quot;win&quot; since I am &quot;let&quot;ting the Lacuna
technicians erase my memory. That is it! &quot;Win&quot; &quot;Let&quot;! Kate
Winslet!!!!!!!! Yes! Clementine is the impulsive eccentric who first
opts for the Lacuna procedure in order to erase her memory of her
romance with Joel (which most of the girls I have gone out with have
also opted to do). <br /><br />Joel (Meeza) Memory Erasing Phase #3: Living screen writing genius
Charlie Chaplin has written another clever script that clearly is
unforgettable! Wait! His name is not Charlie Chaplin! It's Charlie
something! (I start to cough repeatedly). &quot;Man&quot;, I must stop
&quot;cough&quot;ing! That is it! &quot;Cough&quot; &quot;Man&quot; Kauffman!!!!!! His name is
Charlie Kaufman! Yes!!!!! Eat your heart out Lacuna! <br /><br />End of Memory Erasing! <br /><br />OK, I had my fun! I think I should stop these memory erasing puns
before all of you erase this review very soon! To sum it all up, Carrey
and Winslet's performances were exceptional and will be embedded in
your cerebral cortex for days! That is no case of brain damage! Not to
far off are the remarkable supporting acting contributions of Kirsten
Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, and Elijah Wood. They all play the
Lacuna technicians who are in no doubt Lacuna Lunatics. Jon Brion's
musical film score scores high points as the best film score of the
year! Last but not least, we cannot forget the directorial brainyman of
&quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot;. That would be French Director Michel Gondry! He had
a &quot;Gondre&quot; task to achieve in directing a Kauffman script and he was
able to do it masterfully! &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; take
on: fervency, anamnesis, subsistence, loneliness, and exigency cleaned
house with originality to make this film spotless in cinematic
magnanimity. <br /><br />***** Excellent
