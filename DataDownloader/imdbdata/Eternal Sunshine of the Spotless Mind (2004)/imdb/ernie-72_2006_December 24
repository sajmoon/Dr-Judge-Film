I think this is my favourite film of all time, though lots of my
friends disagree. It has something, you need to see it more than once,
and if you have to have experienced love, then lost it you will know
what I mean. The cast is fantastic, but the story is everything. I
don&#39;t think anything comes close to this. It&#39;s one on it&#39;s own. To
those who say it&#39;s too high in the top 250, I say it&#39;s way better than
the &#39;Godfather&#39;. I include no telling of the story, it tells itself.
The two main actors ARE the story.I would like to say more. like I saw
it when it came out but it saw it on DVD, It&#39;s a film you&#39;ll want watch
again and again. I would say this film is underrated so much.
