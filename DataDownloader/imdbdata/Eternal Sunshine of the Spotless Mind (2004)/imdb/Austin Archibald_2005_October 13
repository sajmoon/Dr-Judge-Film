This comment is to save those people who haven't seen it yet, from its
false advertising... I have NO IDEA why this movie is rated #33 on
IMDb! That just shows how weird people are. Maybe I wasn't all that
interested in the characters and their interaction or development, but
rather it was awkward, confusing, and such a waste. I didn't like the
characters AT ALL, and there wasn't really any good chemistry between
them. They were miserable together, and they ended it, and then they
chose to give it another shot, even if it will be miserable again! Now,
I give them the credit for going along for the ride - but relationships
aren't supposed to be like that. There are actually good relationships
out there, but this superficial world seeking for pleasure in temporal
and destroying substances is indicative and portrayed in this movie.
It's interesting that they needed alcohol to make things romantic,
always. It shows a lot about their character, and the character of
those people who loved the movie! I just couldn't wait for the movie to
END! This movie is really terrible. It made me dizzy and confused. I
had NO GOOD feelings come out of it, and felt I had wasted 2 hours of
my life. It isn't entertaining, uplifting, or edifying AT ALL. Really,
Don't Waste Your Time With This Movie.
