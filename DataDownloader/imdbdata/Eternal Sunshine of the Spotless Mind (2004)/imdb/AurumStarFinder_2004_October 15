It's very rare to see something that moves completely. In recent
history the best films are ones that shock you and open your mind to
new thinking. It's rare to see a film which doesn't need to shock you
but is truly special.<br /><br />For those of you reading this who think that this is another Jim Carrey
movie, complete with idiotic gaffs, slapstick and stupidity through and
through, be surprised. Jim Carrey has already proved, I believe, to be
more than a comedian when he did The Truman Show (which I really must
see in full). But even that had Carrey's traditional moves, and from
what I saw I would never believe that he could pull off anything like
Joel Barish. This man should do more stuff like this. If he doesn't it
is a waste of talent and those who have been paying attention to my
previous comments will know that from me that's quite a compliment. In
my eyes this man has finally become an actor. I think that's reason
enough to see this.<br /><br />Here we have two people: Clementine is an external representation of
what Joel is on the inside. They're stuck in a hate-love relationship
which has given them the happiest and the worst moments of their lives.
Yet, Clementine decides, on a lark, that she would rather never
remember anything about Joel and so erases him from her memory. And,
almost in revenge, Joel does the same thing to her. And regrets it
quickly after he realises that his good memories far outweigh the bad
ones, and so tries to take his decision back.<br /><br />Accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack and great acting from Jim Carrey
and Kate Winslet, you'd be a fool not to see this.
