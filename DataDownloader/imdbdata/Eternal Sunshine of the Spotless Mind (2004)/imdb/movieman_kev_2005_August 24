Joel (Jim Carrey) is heartbroken when he finds out, via finding a
telegram mailed to a mutual friend, that his girlfriend, Clementine
(Kate Winslet), in a moment of supreme anger and frustration, went to
have a procedure to have all of her memories of him wiped clean. So he
decides to do the same thing, only realizing while the process is going
on that he truly doesn't want to forget her. This is a beautiful film
dealing with love, loss, grief, acceptance, anger, and the shades in
between, that I almost gave up on watching (I tried to get into it
before, but due to the unbearable slowness of the beginning I had
turned off a little after the opening credits rolled). I'm so very glad
that I gave it another chance, as I found it to be an extremely
heartfelt,honest, and rewarding film. All the performances are pretty
much spot-on and this is without a doubt Jim Carrey's best performance
ever in a film, hands down. I truly can't fathom why a lot of viewers
found this movie to be hard to comprehend, as I found the movie pretty
straight forward in it's simplicity, despite the roundabout way it
choose to present itself.<br /><br />My Grade: A- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Disc 1)Commentary by director Michel Gondry and writer
