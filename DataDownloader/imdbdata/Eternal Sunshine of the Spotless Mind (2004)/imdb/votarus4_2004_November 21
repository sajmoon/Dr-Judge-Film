(Spoiled...) Like the rest of Kaufman's self-absorbed hallucinations,
Eternal Sunshine fails to jump the &quot;who cares&quot; hurdle. What an
overwrought mess of a movie. As far as that
mind-surgery-memory-deleting helmet goes, why in tarnation was Jim
Carrey's character--a self-described uninteresting bore--so very
talented at resisting the program? No mental giant, he would have
succumbed immediately. End of movie. But no! We replay this deja vu
game of meeting forgotten lovers into infinity, while every character
gets thrown into stylistic outer space: Comedy for some, tragedy for
others, sex farce when Mr. Kaufman runs out of ideas. Actually, apart
from Sunshine's tangled structure, there are no ideas. Not once are we
given useful, relevant information about anyone who inhabits the film.
Carrey and Winslet's megawatt dual-presence is wasted inside of a
situation that resembles a hamster cage, not a story. Only Tom
Wilkinson, as the memory-deleting helmet inventor, seems to grasp the
danger of what's happening. Kaufman, however, surrounds him with a gang
of assistants who are giggling morons. What a sad, confused, irrelevant
film. I was reminded more than once of the forgotten French mind-game
films of the sixties. Marienbad, anyone?
