Prepare to bite your lip if you're watching this with friends. I caught
myself getting choked up a few times in this movie. With it's Bang-on,
completely convincing acting, innovative writing of completely
realistic relationship scenarios and reactions to them, and effective
cinematography, sequencing and effects, I felt as though this movie was
speaking directly to me. Almost every review I've read have been very
positive, but I HAVE heard this movie called pretentious and even
clich&eacute;d..<br /><br />Clich&eacute;d, NEVER. A movie about erasing part of your brain, running
through your memories and meeting someone for the 1st time twice is
over done? Come on, we know that isn't true.<br /><br />Pretentious, personally I cannot see it; indy-ish, actual
substance-based movies do not automatically = pretension. When you've
got a cool idea that's well executed by all parties involved, that's
just a good movie - period. Perhaps these people just can't relate; I
can't lie - I find movies like the English Patient and Shine
pretentious, mostly because I can't relate.<br /><br />Anyway, a VERY moving and skillfully constructed movie. Go out and buy
it!
