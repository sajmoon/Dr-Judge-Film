When you meet someone for the very first time, how do you know that
you've never had an encounter with him or her before? Your memories can
do so much for you, unless they are taken away. The motion picture
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind devours this theory and amplifies
it to a new level.<br /><br />An on your toes 'thinker,' Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet light up the
screen, with a little help from Winslet's character's hair color.<br /><br />Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) have a breathtaking
relationship. From Barnes and Noble bookstores to icy ponds in the dead
of winter, they have been through it all-together. Until one day, Joel
stops by Clementine's workplace and finds her unaware of him being more
than a customer passing by. The plot thickens when Joel finds out that
Clementine has her memory of Joel erased forever in a secret process.<br /><br />Seeing that the title of the movie came from a poem written by
Alexander Pope (1688-1744) and the opening credits don't even make an
appearance until twenty minutes into the film, this motion picture sure
has its eccentricity from any other of the sort.<br /><br />This picture has space for many large names. Jim Carrey (How The Grinch
Stole Christmas, Bruce Almighty) uses his personality to portray his
character extremely well. Alongside Carrey, Kate Winslet (Titanic, The
Life of David Gale) shocked me, to be honest. After Titanic appeared on
the silver screen in 1997, she seemed to settle down until The Life of
David Gale took the screen. As a major incentive to seeing this movie,
the cinematography is spectacular. Transitioning from one scene to the
next or from the past to the present may boggle your mind. The camera
work adds extra enjoyment to the movie and really adds to difficulty
and effect.<br /><br />Concerning the film rating of R, there is mild language, drug use and
sexual content. This is a mild R compared to others out there. You will
be pleased with the decency of this film in a rating department. There
is not a lot of foul or uncouth language with diminutive drug use and
sexual content.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, this movie was put together and conveyed really well.
A rental in my book and an 8 out of 10 stars, I'd suggest grabbing a
bag of popcorn and a friend for an evening of satisfaction towards this
movie. Props to Michel Gondry for a first-rate film and a good quality
use of my two dollars.
