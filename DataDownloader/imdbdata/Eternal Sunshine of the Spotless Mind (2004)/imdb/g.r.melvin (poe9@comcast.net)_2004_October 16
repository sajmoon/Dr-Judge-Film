I feel the need to add that the soundtrack is particularly haunting. we
all know that soundtracks can be spotty incoherent slapdash mixes that
serve only as a marketable product that accompanies a film (like a
teeshirt does a concert). but there are some beautiful sounds here. the
producer,Jon Brion (who hosted other marvelous film faves as Magnolia
and Punch-Drunk Love) (He was in a fairly fun band,The Grays in his
early garage days) knows how to charm you and float around in yr head.
Along with his personal work, this soundtrack highlights a fine cover
of the Corgi's one hit wonderful &quot;Everyone's Gotta Learn Sometime&quot; by
BECK. if you liked the movie...
