The idea for this film was one of the most original I have seen in a
long time. The excellent visual effects, NOT done by computer I might
add, enhance the film with a very strange and dreamlike quality.
Eternal Sunshine is filled with great acting, and the whole story is
truly excellent. Contrary to popular belief, Jim Carrey is a great
drama actor. Kate Winslet also did a great acting job as a free spirit.
I have to say it is also probably the best love story to come out in...
who knows how long. It's about time movie-making was put in the hands
of people who can create such a movie as Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind. Eternal Sunshine is a MUST SEE for anyone who truly
enjoys cinema and originality in movies.
