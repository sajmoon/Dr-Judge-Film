Interesting film that I couldn't help comparing to the 70's
relationship defining film Annie Hall. You see, I find it right on that
this relationship film is defined by its era... peoples brains are
treated like computers. Certainly a film worth watching although
neither lead character is very likable and Annie Hall seemed a whole
lot more like real life. Didn't get too many laughs out of this one
either, must mean Jim Carrey did some good acting. Totally illogical
and seriously flawed (the relationship was obviously tailored to fit
the sci-fi premise...children or a decade together would have really
have mucked up the process) -7 out of 10.
