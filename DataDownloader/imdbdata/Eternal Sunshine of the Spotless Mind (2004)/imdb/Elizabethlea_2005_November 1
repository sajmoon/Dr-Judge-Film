Ususally I hate romance movies, but... <br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind beautifully filmed and directed,
the special affects appearing REAL rather than computer generated. The
acting is brilliant. The script is well done, with just the right
amount of swearing in context to believe the characters. The plot is
humorous, dark and touching.<br /><br />Kate Winslett and Jim Carrey portray people who are very flawed, in a
very flawed relationship, trying to work out their differences in an
unconventional way. Smaller roles by Elijiah Wood and Kirsten Dunst are
also done very well. <br /><br />I loved this film because you really believe the two main characters
could be someone you see walking down a busy street. And the way they
seem to slip in and out of reality is masterfully achieved. Most of all
I loved the ending, but I'll let you find out what that is... <br /><br />All in all I really loved this movie!!
