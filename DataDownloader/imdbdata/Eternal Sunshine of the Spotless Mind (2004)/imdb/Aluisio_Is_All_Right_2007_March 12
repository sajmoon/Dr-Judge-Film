&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (cool title taken from
Alexander Pope&#39;s poem &quot;Eloisa to Abelard&quot;) is one of the most original,
hilarious and oddly moving films about love and all its phases. Thanks
to Charlie Kaufman&#39;s flawless, much deserving Oscar-winning script
(co-written by Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth), and Gondry&#39;s
spectacular visual talent, ESOTSM became a one of a kind masterpiece.
Take Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s gorgeous &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;, which features
the overwhelming sensation of falling in love among chaos and
depression, and go deeper, when the perfect couple don&#39;t feel so into
each other anymore and their ugly side is evident, and you can have an
idea of what expect from the V-Day card created by the same mind who
gave us &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and &quot;Adaptation.&quot;.<br /><br />Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) discovers that his beloved Clementine
Kruczysnki (Kate Winslet) underwent a bizarre procedure to erase him
from her mind, and decides to do the same. But only after the
physicians start to erase his memories, Joel realizes he loves Clem so
much that he wants to remember both the good and bad times they had
together - so our hero has to run with Clem from the doctors (inside
his mind!) and struggle to stop them before everything&#39;s gone. Sounds
crazy? It is. It&#39;s also extremely funny and poignant. Who never wanted
to forget the one who broke our heart? What if you could really do it?
Now, the hardest thing to know is whether it&#39;s worth it or not. A
discreet Carrey and a garrulous Winslet are fantastic as the leads, and
the supporting cast (Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah
Wood, David Cross and Jane Adams) is equally brilliant.<br /><br />&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; is compelling for those who
have just had their first heartbreak, AND for those who consider
themselves experts in matters of the heart as well. It seems that (at
least to me), when it comes to love and relationships, the more we seem
to understand them, the less we really know about them. After seeing
this movie, I realized I shouldn&#39;t worry that much... everybody&#39;s gotta
learn sometime. 10/10.
