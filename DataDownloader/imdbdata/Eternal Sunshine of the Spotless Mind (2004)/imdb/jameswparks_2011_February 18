Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was just a real joy to watch. The
film literally kept me on edge the entire time. It is a rather complex
movie, with twists, turns, surprises, and subplots, but they all come
together very nicely.<br /><br />Basically, two people are seeing each other, and the breakup is bad.
Ever have a really bad breakup, and you wish you had never known the
other person? Well, in this movie, it&#x27;s possible with a revolutionary
memory erasing system.<br /><br />To avoid spoilers, I won&#x27;t go much further, but basically the
characters decide, while in the middle of the memory erasing procedure,
that he still has feelings for her.<br /><br />Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, and Kirsten Dunts make up an A-list cast, for
an A+ movie. It has also been recently released on bluray, so now is
the perfect time to give this movie a chance.
