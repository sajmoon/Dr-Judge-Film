Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a mouthful as far as titles
go, however that narrow sense confusion is intentional none the
less.What then ensues is a pondering, thoughtful film between two
opposites which leaves you with a sense of perspective,appreciation and
quiet happiness. This film stages excitement, love, personal thoughts,
bitterness, contempt and all the other emotions from a relationship
that didn&#39;t go all the way. Most of all however this film focuses on
reflection over time and instills optimism in one as well as a bit of
regret.<br /><br />What you have the pleasure of observing is an uncharacteristically
mature performance from Jim Carrey as Joel Barish, a shy and lovelorn
thirty something with whom a sense of relation and understanding
develops. Alongside Joel you find Celmentime Kruczynski who is
quirky,unstable and admirably performed by Kate Winslet in a role which
more than demonstrates but merely confirms her ability as a major
actress.<br /><br />This is a people film, a life film and one that should be viewed on the
basis that it has the power to change the way you perceive matters,
ultimately, for the better.<br /><br />9/10
