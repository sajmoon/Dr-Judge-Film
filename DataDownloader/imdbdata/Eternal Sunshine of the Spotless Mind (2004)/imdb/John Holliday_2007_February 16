Anyone who has been in a relationship for a significant period of time
should see this movie. Without going to deep into the psychological
aspect of human nature with regards to monotony (i.e. relationship
patterns), this movie was incredible. As a &quot;tough guy&quot; type young man
who (after thinking about it) had not cried in years, I found tears
streaming down my face as this movie ended and that perfect song began
playing. I immediately called my girlfriend of 3 years, and spent the
remainder of the evening putting things in perspective in my mind. So
often we begin to focus on all the little BS in life, and allow it to
stress us over and over. No matter who you are in the US of A, you&#39;re
life is not that bad! Opportunity and beauty is everywhere.<br /><br />Change your hearts people. Look around you.
