When I first saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wasn&#x27;t
expecting to love it, let alone like it. What a surprise when I saw it!
I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and
packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don&#x27;t mind me saying so,
it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.<br /><br />I especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot.
The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which
is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short
of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn&#x27;t have the best soundtrack/score I
have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more
moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.<br /><br />I was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an
almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but
neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script
which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing
very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.<br /><br />I have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind&#x27;s performances either. As good as the supporting performances are
especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the
real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in
some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty
showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show
show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here,
but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real
star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress,
Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.<br /><br />Overall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant
helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10
