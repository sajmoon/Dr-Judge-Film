This movie was very original, which is why I thought it was OK. I
didn't think the concept was anything that great though. It's basically
a romance. But instead of showing the two meeting and falling for each
other in the conventional way, it's all shown in memories as they are
being erased. In the film, there is technology that can erase memories.
Joel learns his ex-girlfriend, Clemetine, had him erased, so he goes to
have the same procedure done to him. But, during the procedure, part of
him doesn't want to lose all the memories. So, most of the latter part
of the film shows things that Joel and Clementine did together. And
once Joel realizes he doesn't want her erased he begins dragging
Clementine throughout his memories and trying to hide her. It's rather
weird, but the way it's shown makes sense.<br /><br />The side plot involves the employees from the memory erasing place.
Mary finds out something about her and the doctor and it changes the
way she feels about the procedure. And somehow Joel and Clementine meet
again after their memories were erased and start hanging out together.
Then each gets an interesting piece of mail that leads to the
conclusion.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Kate Winslet received so many acting nominations. I
didn't think any of the actors did anything exceptional.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: I give it props for originality, but it's not a great
story. But, I do recommend it if you want to see something new.
