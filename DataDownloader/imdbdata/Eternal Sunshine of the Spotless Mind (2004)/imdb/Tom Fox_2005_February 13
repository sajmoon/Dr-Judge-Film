Perfection in film making. Actors, film work, plot, all perfect. Other
movies released in 2004 pale in comparison. The only shame is the fact
Eternal Sunshine did not receive the exposure deserved. This movie will
certainly become a cult classic. <br /><br />I'm not a person who typically enjoys the &quot;love story&quot; but Eternal
Sunshine treats the viewer with intelligence and respect. I regret not
having seen this movie until the DVD release.<br /><br />I've not seen a movie this good since American Beauty. Why must we
suffer through yet another Spiderman rather than quality work such as
Eternal Sunshine?
