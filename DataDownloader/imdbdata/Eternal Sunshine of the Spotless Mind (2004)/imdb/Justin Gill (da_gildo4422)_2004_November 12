First of all i'd like to get some things in the open... - I do NOT like
Kate Winslet at all, but she was perfect - Do NOT turn this movie off
before you watch at least 45 minutes of it, it may start slow but it iw
worth the wait and in the end, you'll understand it's unique beauty. -
Jim Carrey is gaining respect with each role he takes<br /><br />Secondly, i debated turning this movie off after about 20 minutes
because it was just kinda boring BUT it had HUGE potential.<br /><br />I was skeptical<br /><br />Then confused<br /><br />And now I'm amazed<br /><br />if you enjoy a move that makes you think, and if you have any
relationships in your past that you remotely regret, you will LOVE this
flick.<br /><br />One of this years best.
