When I saw the film I said Is genial, the best of all is the screenplay
is so original and the performances of Jim Carrey and Kate Wislet, The
script is great is an original idea, this picture will be one great
candidate in this Oscar edition. The music the cinematographer and all
in definitive the best performance of carrey after Truman show and we
can consider now that Kate winslet is an actress serious and she is
able to do anything or any role, Tom wilkinson kristen Dunst and Elijah
Wood are correctly too, and Michael Gondry worked so hard I'm sure and
for that this is a great picture Thanks so much Charlie Kaufman you are
one of the best original scripter of the moment
