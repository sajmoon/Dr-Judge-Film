Eternal Sunshine is weird and sad. However, it is funny in a strange
way, and the concept of the whole thing is very interesting. I have
only seen it once, but I certainly think it is one of those movies that
you can't watch once and get every detail. It is very complex. Also,
the cast is great. I love Jim Carrey as a comedian, but it is
refreshing to see him in a role where he doesn't contort his face every
five minutes. Kate Winslet is very goofy at times, especially at the
beginning, but she can also become serious on the fly and I respect
that. I like the fact that Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are in this
movie. They are great actors. This is a thought-provoking movie and it
is genuinely enjoyable. Certainly worth a watch.
