Some of the other reviewers will drone on about the inherent struggle
in modern man between the rational and the irrational. Some of the
other reviewers will try to impress you with their understanding of
this film as an indictment of our unthinking society married to the
yearning to immerse oneself in those same undifferentiated
drinking-pot-smoking- carefree ways. They see it they story of two
people doing they best they can in play and love in our crazy inhuman
world, a world with water everywhere but not a drop to drink.<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers will even tell you that this film is a work
of modern art, citing the schizophrenic direction, the anxious
performances by Carrey and Winslet, the brilliantly weird-incongruous
sound work, or the Kaufman-trademark wordplay. <br /><br />I instead am stressing an overlooked aspect of this film:<br /><br />IT HAS KIRSTEN DUNST DANCING IN HER PANTIES BOOOOHH YEAAAAHHHHH GAME
OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10.0!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
