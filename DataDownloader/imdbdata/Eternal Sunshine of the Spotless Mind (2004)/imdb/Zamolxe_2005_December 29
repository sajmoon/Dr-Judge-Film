Another one from Charlie Kaufman, about as good as Being John
Malkovich, not quite as good as Adaptation. <br /><br />The story is more cohesive this time, but Kaufman again throws too much
useless stuff for the movie to have that much substance. In the end
everything is reduced to a fundamental &quot;truth&quot;: &quot;We cannot be separated
by our memories, because we ARE our memories&quot;.<br /><br />Still a thoroughly original movie with good performances, especially by
Kirsten Dunst in a secondary role. If Kaufman would be able to infuse
his scripts with more feeling it would be for the best. <br /><br />Overrated perhaps, but still a good watch.
