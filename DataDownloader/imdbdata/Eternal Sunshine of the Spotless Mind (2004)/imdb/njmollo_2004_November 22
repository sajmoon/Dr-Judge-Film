Carrey gives a fantastic performance in this film. Winslet is
wonderful. She is the most gifted actor of her generation. I suppose
you could call this an &quot;actors film&quot;. They are given the time to
express and perform; but it is more than that. <br /><br />Scenes are emotional, intense, desperate and funny which smacks of the
team effort. The lighting is excellent. The editing sharp, detailed and
clean. The direction is inspired and inventive.<br /><br />The script is complete with all the elements that make this a great
film. Maybe a Classic? The best film I have seen this year. <br /><br />Americans can make good films if they try. This proves it.
