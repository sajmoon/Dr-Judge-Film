When one comes out of first viewing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind, it is almost hard to know what to truly think of it. The film
takes you on such a bizarre, mind-bending adventure that the first
impression is not the one in which really matters. Like many other
films from this director, Michel Gondry, it is a film that tends to get
better with age.<br /><br />The film&#x27;s premise is one of the most original I think ever used within
a film. The thought that someone could erase specific memories from
your mind is at times something any human wishes they could have done.
Who wouldn&#x27;t want to forget a traumatic experience or bad relationship?
Still what this film does is make you think about life, love, and
memories in a way in which no other film in history has ever made you
think.<br /><br />The film was superbly directed by Michel Gondry, who also co-wrote this
Oscar winning screenplay with ace screenwriter Charlie Kauffman. I
truly believe that this is both filmmakers best works, but the film
truly shines thanks to its cast, in particular Jim Carrey, who seems to
be playing the only straight man in a comedic story. It is bar none his
best dramatic performance to date, and any fan of his work should check
this film out.<br /><br />Overall Eternal Sunshine is a totally unique experience that even after
a few viewings I still don&#x27;t know what to truly think of it, but time
will tell where this film truly stands.<br /><br />I give Eternal Sunshine a 10 out of 10!
