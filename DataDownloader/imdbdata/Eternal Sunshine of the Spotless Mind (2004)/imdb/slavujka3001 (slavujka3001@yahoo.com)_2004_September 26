I was simply amazed after i have seen this movie. I haven't seen such a
good movie in a long time. It is an ultimate Hollywood commercial
production GETAWAY! Jim Carey has outdone him self in this role. He
proved that he can act, and brilliant too. I wonder why he always
played as a comedian?! Winslet is a standard movie diva. She simply
can't fail. I very much liked the question that this movie poses... If
you ever wanted to erase your ex lover from your memory (i guess a lot
of people wanted sometimes) would you do it so simply? Bad memories
come along with the good memories. Would you like to erase them too?<br /><br />I think thats the whole point of this movie. And it's beautifully
presented. A real lesson for movie makers!
