are the ones we want to forget.Clementine Cruczynski has been cleared
of all the memories she has of Joel Barish.After he learns this he goes
to Dr.Howard Mierzwiak and asks him to erase Clementine from his
head.During the process, while he&#39;s walking down the memory lane he
wants the whole memory erasure project to be canceled.He finds out his
love for Clementine is too strong.But is it too late? The Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is not your typical romantic
movie.It&#39;s no wonder since Charlie Kaufman was writing it.He can come
up with an eccentric film like this.Michel Gondry is the director.There
are some science fiction elements in this movie.That&#39;s one of the
reasons this movie is as interesting as it is.Jim Carrey, who we know
mostly as a comedian gives a fantastic dramatic performance as
Joel.It&#39;s a little tragicomic when he goes back to being a little child
in his memories and he cries.That&#39;s so heartbreaking yet amusing with
his mommy and those bullies there.Kate Winslet with the changing hair
color is brilliant as Clementine.Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my
darling Clementine.Sorry, just couldn&#39;t help it but that&#39;s such a
wonderful song that we also hear in this movie.The fantastic Tom
Wilkinson plays Dr.Mierzwiak.Other great performances include Mark
Ruffalo, who plays Stan.Elijah Wood is Patrick and Kirsten Dunst is
Mary.David Cross and Jane Adams play the roles of Rob and Carrie.This
is a movie I recommend for all those who are into original films.This
is a movie not to forget.
