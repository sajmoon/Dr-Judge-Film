This film made me love the characters, (always a good thing) and made
me love the writer, Kaufman, even more. Being John M was is one of my
top favorite films.<br /><br />When you think about Clem and Joel during the day, what they may be up
to these days, that's says a lot about one writer can do. There
actually may be only one writer alive, Kaufman, with other writers,
Cheyevky, being dead. There's a few others I haven't mentioned.<br /><br />Is the movie so good because It has strong characters or because the
theme is so neat? I could go on about the study of memory itself, but
Isn't the film really a bitter, romantic comedy and not a science
story?<br /><br />One problem with being too rooted in plausibility, is that the story
becomes routine, like a trip by air to Hong Kong. Whereas that theme
might have been exciting in 1890, it ceases to be currently. So, Watch
out for events needing explanation or plausibility. That's quite
overrated.
