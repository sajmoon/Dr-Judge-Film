I didn't see this movie for years because I thought it would be
something like 50 First Dates (which I found dull). Far from it. Like
Being John Malkovich - I think - Eternal Sunshine... revolves around
the existential notion of the self-creating individual. What comes to
mind is the story &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; by Kafka, where a man finds himself
transformed into a cockroach one day and finds how his life or he
himself turns out to be totally inadequate. The story plays upon the
&quot;what if..&quot; - things would be so great if I were somebody else, what if
I were John Malkovich, or if a part of me I don't like could be erased,
like in Eternal Sunshine... Existentialism holds that it's ridiculous
to think you could be somebody else, as there would be no you anymore.
The self-responsible, self-creating individual cannot take shortcuts
without failure, as we can see in the case of Joel, who chooses to
delete all of his memories of a past girlfriend, only to find that he
really needs them. Most of this movie takes place in his mind. Like
&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and &quot;Adaptation,&quot; &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind&quot; feels like a European movie shot in Hollywood. It's just
a great movie, with extremely good, natural performances (Kate Winslet
rightfully received her Oscar nomination for this role). Just go and
check the Awards and Nominations list. This is romantic, and a comedy,
and food for thought at the same time. You'll find yourself coming
back.
