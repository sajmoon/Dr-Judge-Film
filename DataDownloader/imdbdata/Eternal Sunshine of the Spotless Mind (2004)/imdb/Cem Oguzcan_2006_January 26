Wow, where should i begin? This movie is one of those films which makes
you question your life, your existence. If seen with the one you love
it makes you wanna just embrace her/him and never let go. it is a story
of true twisted and unusual love involving two complete opposites yet
we end up with a perfect match. I know this sounds lame, but Gondry and
Kaufman made something thats so over the top that is almost the
undeniable definition of movie making.<br /><br />Kate Winslet, one of the most talented actresses ever, is again
marvelous yet with a role that is very unlikely of her previous ones.
Jim Carrey once again proves that he can do some serious acting along
with his comedy influence at hold. I guess it would only be fair to say
that Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey have switched roles for this once.
Kate Winslet as Clementime Kruczynski draws a portrait of a sensational
impulsive girl while Jim Carrey as Joel Barrish is a timid young man
looking basically for companionship.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman is the clear explication of what talent is, not only
with e.s but also with his other screenplays.(e.g being john malkovich,
adaptation) He grasps the audience by heart and gives them the
experience of a lifetime Congrats, two thumbs up(if not less)
