&quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot; is one of the rare films that actually overcomes its
flaws completely and makes itself into a great film without dishing
everything out to the audience. There&#39;s no real format to the film. It
jumps from place to place, often confusing the viewer for a moment, but
creating a unique and rewarding experience.<br /><br />The acting in the film is great across the board. Jim Carrey gives a
very good, but not quite Oscar-caliber turn as Joel, a quiet writer
whose dull nature destroys any true fun in his relationships. Kate
Winslet plays Clementine, an impulsive and energetic woman whose hair
color is constantly changing as her relationship with Joel does.
Winslet is really the shining star in the film. She is beautiful,
vibrant, and full of life, bringing an edge to the film. It&#39;s truly a
shame she wasn&#39;t put in the Supporting Actress section of the Oscars,
where she could have had a win. Elijah Wood is annoying as usual, but
he&#39;s playing an annoying character so it&#39;s passable. Tom Wilkinson is
very good as the doctor behind the whole experiment that is the basis
of the film, and Kirsten Dunst is surprisingly fantastic in a small
role as the doctor&#39;s secretary. The plot itself is fantastic, truly
delving into the mind and memories of Joel. Carrey is a little over the
top at times, but he still moves through the film well with help from
the leading lady. This is an extraordinary, Oscar-nomination worthy
film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a smart film that
is also funny and dramatic at times.
