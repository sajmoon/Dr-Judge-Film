This movie pleasantly surprised me. I am not the biggest fan of Jim
Carrey. He never won me over with the comedic talent, I definitely
found him to be very Andy Kaufman, you either loved him or hated him.<br /><br />This movie did, however, let me see a different side of him. It was a
very relatable side, and I'm glad I saw the movie, even though I told
myself it was going to be terrible. <br /><br />Everyone involved did a wonderful job, and I like how it never strays
from the plot of the movie, in any of the characters - through Kirsten
Dunst, to Mark Ruffalo, to Elijah Wood. It just goes to show that
you'll make the same mistaks no matter if you go back and change them.
