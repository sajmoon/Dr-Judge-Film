Even though unfortunately this movie was not as brilliant as the other
and earlier written Charlie Kaufman movie &#x22;Being John Malkovich&#x22; it&#x27;s
still a great and unique watch. Still not entirely fair that this movie
always have been given more credit than &#x22;Being John Malkovich&#x22;, fore
this movie is surely not without it flaws.<br /><br />It above all things is a Charlie Kaufman. It&#x27;s not necessarily a Michel
Gondry movie, not necessarily a Jim Carrey movie, or not necessarily a
Kate Winslet movie. It&#x27;s a movie that really has a typical trademark
Charlie Kaufman style all over it. A real accomplishment and what other
movie writer can say a thing like that as well. This movie also earned
Kaufman his first ever Oscar, while he already got nominated two times
before in the past.<br /><br />&#x22;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#x22; takes you along for a ride and
takes you to a strange world, in which you know more than halve of it
isn&#x27;t for real. It&#x27;s a dream like movie but not as far off as I
probably make it sound right not. It&#x27;s a perfectly accessible movie for
all type of audiences. Don&#x27;t be alarmed or scared off by it&#x27;s art-house
kind of reputation. The story is at all times perfectly understandable,
even though quite some strange things are happening in it.<br /><br />It&#x27;s an unique movie for sure, that also has a unique love theme in it.
It&#x27;s refreshing that it doesn&#x27;t handle it romantic aspects in a
formulaic way, though it also needs to be said that it&#x27;s also thanks to
Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet&#x27;s performances that its main story and two
main characters work out so well for the movie and therefore also its
romantic theme.<br /><br />It&#x27;s again one of those roles in which Jim Carrey shows that he can
really act, without trying to be or look funny all of the time. Too bad
a lot of people still don&#x27;t see this. The movie also features some
other great and well known actors beside Carrey and Winslet, such as
Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a great movie with some great movie-making tricks. It&#x27;s a true
visual movie, with an almost constant dream like atmosphere. A lot of
old fashioned techniques are being used, which are all still better
looking than modern special effects and are therefore more effective,
especially for this type of movie, as well.<br /><br />My complaint with this movie is though that its story and the way it&#x27;s
progressing is quite predictable all. It&#x27;s not really the story that
offers the movie with its most unique or greatest moments, though the
writing in general still remains great, as weird as that might sound.
Hopefully you will understand what I mean by this when you watch the
movie yourself.<br /><br />Certainly a great and also definitely unique movie to watch. Especially
for the Kaufman fans.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
