OK, I'm not going to bash this movie because it did have it's merits.
It was just an interesting concept that didn't work for me. Character
development was nil which makes us apathetic about their relationship
which makes for a rotten love story. Not a funny movie although
probably not meant to be. Whats left? An average drama I suppose. Let's
face it, two hours of dream sequences had a lot of us bored &amp; restless
regardless of how clever the concept may have been. I really liked
Winslets and Carreys performances. The rest of the cast was expendable.
Overall a 7 out of 10. Coulda been a contender(on my list). I feel as
if critics jumped on the bandwagon on this one for fear of being pass&eacute;
or out of touch. Maybe with all of the Hollywood garbage out there now
a carnation such as this comes out smelling like a rose. Worth a watch,
that's it. The ending reminded me of Jerry McGuire(good film , bad love
story). Two people settling for mediocrity.
