2008_February 10 
After almost 20 mind-numbingly incomprehensible minutes that seemed so
much longer, it comes as a shock to realize that what one is suddenly
seeing floating across the screen is (after 20 minutes, remember) the
&quot;opening&quot; credits of the movie. This can mean only one thing - and it
isn&#39;t good news: sweet Jesus, there&#39;s still an entire movie to come.<br /><br />I confess that I&#39;m not entirely enamoured of Jim Carrey. I&#39;ve seen him
as a weak part of a good movie (Bruce Almighty) and as the strong part
of a weak movie (The Grinch Who Stole Christmas). Either way, he
doesn&#39;t turn my crank. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever watch a movie just
because the star was Jim Carrey. To be honest, in &quot;Eternal Sunshine
...&quot; I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s strong or weak, but it really doesn&#39;t matter
because the story is absurd, disjointed and not really all that
interesting. It had potential. The whole &quot;erasing negative memories&quot;
had a vaguely Orwellian tone to it that intrigued me (which is why I
rented it) but in the end it failed badly. When I find myself hoping
(even yearning) for a movie to come to an end, I know it&#39;s been a
disaster.<br /><br />The most intriguing thing about this movie is the following statement
right off the DVD jacket it came in: [&quot;Eternal Sunshine ... is] a
memorable film that the Wall Street Journal calls &#39;a romantic comedy
unlike any other.&quot; I can&#39;t argue with that - it is &quot;memorable&quot; (no
matter how hard I&#39;ll try to, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to forget
it) and it is &quot;a romantic comedy unlike any other.&quot; Give thanks for
small mercies - this truly is one of a kind, and, in truth, there must
never be another like it. 1/10
