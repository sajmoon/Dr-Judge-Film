Without having any knowledge of what the film was about, I began to
watch it. A man met a woman, strangely fast, they fell in love... Oh,
no, is that all?<br /><br />Surprisingly, there was a totally different story behind that.
Gradually, it was shown in front of me, so real that I was deeply into
it. Love, hate, happy, sorrow, inspiring, depressed, every feeling were
around me and the painful of losing was hard to be driven away. Love
and ignore all his shortcomings, get boring, hate and ignore all his
merit. People are doing this all the time and many just aren't aware of
it. If only they can drill deep inside their mind, they will find that
hate can also become a beautiful memory.<br /><br />This is life. What shall we do? Face it and enjoy it.
