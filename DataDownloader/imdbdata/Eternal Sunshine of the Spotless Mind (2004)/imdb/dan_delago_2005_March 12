We are not worthy Charlie Kaufman! This is what good creative film
writing is all about folks. Kaufman is a genius. This film finally
shows his merits and that he can carry a movie to commercial success
without compromising too much on artistic merit.<br /><br />I wanted to review this film because I just bought it on DVD and saw it
again. It's amazing how many things I missed in the movie the first
time I viewed it on the big screen. This is one of those films you can
see again and again and still get something new and refreshing from it.<br /><br />I also have to credit the French director who collaborated with
Kaufman. His name is Michel Gondry. If it were not for his artistic
vision and surreal cinematography expertise, this film would not
translate well to a mass audience. It really shows you how important it
is for creative minds in Hollywood to work as a team.<br /><br />Now for the acting. A drum roll please. Kate Winslet, I love you! Your
portrayal of Clementine deserved an Oscar. It was so raw and energized.
It was spontaneous and that is what attracted Joel to your character.
They complimented each other so well. Seeing Jim Carrey as this
introspective, reticent character was haunting and that is why it was
so real.<br /><br />I do not want to give away any of the plot because I believe everyone
should see this film. We have all been jilted by a lover once in our
lives and that is why the romance between Joel and Clementine rings
true to the heart universally.<br /><br />There is a seen that takes place between Joel and Clementine at a beach
front house that is so moving it almost brought me to tears.<br /><br />I hope everyone has an opportunity to view this movie and enjoy it for
the pain and pleasure you will feel when you experience it.
