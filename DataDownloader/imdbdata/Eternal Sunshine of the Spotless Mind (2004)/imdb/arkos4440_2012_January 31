I&#x27;ve always found this movie fascinating for a number of reasons, but
it&#x27;s only been recently that I&#x27;ve discovered just what it is that draws
me into this crazy story. I think what sold me on this film is the way
it straddles and selects themes from many different genres. Overall it
seems mostly to be a romantic comedy of sorts, though even this could
probably be debated. But while mostly centering on romance with a
comedic touch the movie seems to carry a strong message, which it
conveys with events that seem to resemble psychological thrillers and
maybe even sci-fi at a stretch.Because it uses so many elements of so
many genres it is an interesting movie to look at from an analytical
standpoint. It brings together many motifs to tell a compelling story
that draws upon an entire range of emotions, making it very engaging to
watch. Overall I really enjoyed it.
