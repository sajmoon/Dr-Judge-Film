This is a very clever film, where you have to think hard, particularly
for the first half. The acting (and effects) are excellent. Because of
the complexity of the plot, it was only in the second half that I began
to (understand) and felt increasingly involved with what was going on.<br /><br />Brilliant scenes on the beach, flashbacks, imagining childhood, running
from erasing memories and at the doctor's. Another part of the film's
brilliance was to make the science fiction of memory removal become
totally believable. And the progression of the plot never lets up, with
constant addition of new aspects right up to the end. <br /><br />In contrast with some films where reality and fantasy are intentionally
confused (which I generally find annoying) this film gives sufficient
clues to help the viewer to identify the scenes which are reality from
others that are flashbacks or imagination.<br /><br />A lot of lessons on relationships - particularly the ultimate value of
memories, even if they are painful.
