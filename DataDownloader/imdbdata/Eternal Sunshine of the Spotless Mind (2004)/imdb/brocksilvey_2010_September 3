Michel Gondry&#x27;s fabulous head trip stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet
(superb) as members of an on-again off-again relationship who take part
in an experiment that allows people to delete memories from their
heads.<br /><br />The question the film obviously asks is: would you get rid of painful
memories if you could, or are those memories as much a part of you and
your growth as the pleasant ones? Gondry finds a dazzling visual way to
represent the deterioration of his protagonists&#x27; memories, and for all
its cerebral sleights of hand, the film carries a big emotional wallop.<br /><br />Winslet is dynamite and should have won the Oscar for which she was
nominated.<br /><br />Grade: A
