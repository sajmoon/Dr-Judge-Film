&#x22;How happy is the blameless vestal&#x27;s lot! The world forgetting, by the
world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray&#x27;r
accepted, and each wish resign&#x27;d.&#x22; - Alexander Pope <br /><br />Michel Gondry&#x27;s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliantly
heartfelt and complicated tale that delves, rather flawlessly, into the
labyrinth of human emotions and the pain often involved in trying to
make a relationship work. Charlie Kaufman, the main writer behind
Eternal Sunshine, often allows his ingenuity and talent to infuse the
film with perfectly subtle touches of emotion and humanity. His
understanding of relationships and the variety of complexities involved
is often wondrous to behold. <br /><br />One day, Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey), after falling in love with
Clementine (Kate Winslet), finds out that she, due to her recent
unhappiness with the relationship, had Joel erased from her memory
through a procedure carried out by the Lacuna company. Eventually,
Joel, himself, wants the same operation, in order that he can forget
Clementine as well. Through this procedure, the film delves into Joel&#x27;s
thoughts and past, chaotically revealing his memories as he eventually
attempts to outrun the erasing of them, after realizing how much the
lovely moments with Clementine rather largely outweighed the upsetting
ones.<br /><br />The cast, from Kirsten Dunst to Jim Carrey, is superb in the portrayal
of their characters. In one of his more dynamic roles, Jim Carrey
presents Joel Barrish as a complex and three-dimensional character, and
seems wholly convincing and sympathetic throughout. Clementine is
played absolutely brilliantly by Kate Winslet. Her on-screen chemistry
with Carrey is thoroughly entrancing and poignant. The entirety of the
supporting cast deliver a subliminally nuanced and engrossing blend of
emotions as well.<br /><br />The apparent surrealism deftly blends with the realism in a way that
allows the viewer a more complete view of the tale. This subtle
relationship between the director, the writer, and the screen is
enhanced and brought to life with the assistance of the exceptional
cinematography and the seamless transitions and edits. <br /><br />The feelings and expressions throughout the film cast a picture so
hauntingly realistic, it&#x27;s difficult not to see some aspect of a past
relationship unfolding on-screen. The engaging and creative ways Gondry
and Kaufman explore Joel&#x27;s memories and dreams is humorous, chaotic,
touching, and heartbreaking all at once. <br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is a consistently moving and
thought-provoking film that remains my favorite film of all time.
Simply perfect.
