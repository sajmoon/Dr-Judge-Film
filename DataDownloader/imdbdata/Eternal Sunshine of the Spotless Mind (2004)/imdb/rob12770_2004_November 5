OK, I'm a smart guy, BA Hons,.pc tech, but what the hell was this film
about ?? OK, so it kind of comes together at the end..just..i love jim
carry especially the truman show and the majestic.<br /><br />but blah bl;a of a mind thing was just too confusing, i sat through 90%
of this with a confused look on my face , i was gonna turn it off a
couple of times but i saw it through to the end..I'm sad that i don't
like this movie enough to recommend it , but i cant, its just too bad.
it does have the redeeming quality that its different from most movies,
its kinda like ..vanilla sky or something mad like that,..oh and its
not a comedy in case u where wondering. 3 out of 10 (for being
different and good acting)
