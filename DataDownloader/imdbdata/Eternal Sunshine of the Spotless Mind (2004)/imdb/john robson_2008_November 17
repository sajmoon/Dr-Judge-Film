I was just crusin through the top 100 films and Eternal Sunshine popped
up in 56 place, how? I remember I had to watch this film 4 times as it
knocked me to sleep every time.People saying this film has meaning is
complete dribble. What did I miss? It&#39;s not interesting it&#39;s just a
load of lovey dovey strange, pointless film. I just didn&#39;t get it. Help
me out here, how can you like this. There must have been a lot of
friends and family involved in rating this film to get it into the top
100. If you really liked this movie you have seriously got to get a
life. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Pokerdot Jumper would have been
more interesting. FFS GAL
