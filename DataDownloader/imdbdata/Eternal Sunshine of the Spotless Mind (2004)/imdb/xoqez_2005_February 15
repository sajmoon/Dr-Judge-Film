This Film is the only film ever to make me cry.<br /><br />As you watch this film your emotions will be played with. I found I
connected with the Director's view on the file rather than the
characters themselves.<br /><br />The film deals with the problem of breaking up with someone and a
company delete this from your mind. What if you could not remember
anyone you went out with?<br /><br />The question is asked by Joel 'Can this cause brain damage?' the answer
is 'It is technically Brain Damage' but I think the sociological damage
is more severe that any damage from the treatment.<br /><br />Anyway this is a must but make sure you in the mood to sit and take in
the movie.
