I absolutely LOOOOVED that movie.. I got the DVD from a friend of mine
over the week-end I was so fascinated and touched by it, that I watched
for about 7 times in those two days.. Its my new favorite movie. I love
it... if you have not seen it.. its a MUST! Jim Carey has a film role
which he never played before... same with Kate Winslet.. those two
actors are incredible. the story is great... its just fun to watch! I
was really impressed by the idea of the film and how it got realized..
its really breathtaking. I wish Id be having such a love affair, as the
two main characters did.. they could erase each other from their
memory, but while erasing they realize what kind of love they feel for
each other.. its really touching and brilliant. Thumbs up!
