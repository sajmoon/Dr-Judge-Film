Charlie Kaufman writer and Jim Carey as lead, I had high hopes going in
to seeing this film. I was not disappointed. This movie met and greatly
exceeded my expectations. This is a hauntingly beautiful movie about
relationships and experiences. Jim Carey and Kate Winslet deliver
superb performances as a likable couple that I could relate to. They
are supported by a wonderful cast of colorful characters that add
different textures of love, relationships and experiences. What makes
this film stand far above the rest is its original plot of &quot;what if
memory were erasable&quot; and the filming effects that take on the journey
of the protagonist as he experiences this first hand. This movie has
some spectacular moments that anyone who has been in love will be
touched with a sense of connection to the characters.
