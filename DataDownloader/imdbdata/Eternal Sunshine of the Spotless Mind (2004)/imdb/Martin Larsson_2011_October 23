This is a movie which I really want to like, and a movie which I&#x27;m sure
I would have liked if it wasn&#x27;t for one small flaw: The character that
Kate Winslett plays is just, through and through, a horrible person and
I couldn&#x27;t care less when Jim Carrey&#x27;s character decides to remove her
from his memory. That is, the whole movie seems to build upon the
internal conflict that the main character feels once the memories of
his former girl friend starts to vanish. However, it&#x27;s like watching a
movie where someone&#x27;s trying to get rid of her love for Hitler. I feel
zero conflict.<br /><br />For the record, I&#x27;ve seen this movie five times. I really want to like
it, but I can&#x27;t. If they just would have made the female lead likable,
I would have given it a solid nine or ten.
