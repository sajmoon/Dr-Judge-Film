It's too far in between that we are blessed with writers, directors,
and actors that can tell a story that really bring YOU into the film. I
was captivated by every scene of this film. I don't want to spoil it
but the actors were SO convincing. They made you feel as if they were
really going through all these experience. It felt like I was really
watching someone else's life. It was THAT real. <br /><br />Jim Carey and Kate Winslet were amazing in these roles. I believe this
to be Jim Carey's and Kate Winslet's best dramatic performance by far.
I'm not comparing them to any other actors because they simply put
themselves in their own category. Jim Carey will soon be realized by
all to not just be a great comedian but a great dramatic actor. Buying
this movie right now.
