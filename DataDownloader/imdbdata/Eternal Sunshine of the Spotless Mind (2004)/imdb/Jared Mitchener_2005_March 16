This movie is one of a kind. The idea that one's bad memories can be
erased is enough seed of an idea from which to harvest comic material
for a small miniseries, and this movie is like the highlights all
scrunched into 2 hours. The action is non-stop, the suspense is
ever-present, the cinematography is so fresh, and the acting is purely
enthralling. You will find yourself so captured by the story that you
will forget that you are watching a movie. Movies like this take our
subconscious spirits on a joy ride and leave the rest of us to try and
catch up. The catching up only comes well after the movie is over, as
the smiles take days to wear off. After watching this movie, I
immediately KNEW that it was in my top 25 of all time, and that it
would stay there forever. Other movies with similar bizarre plots will
come close, I'm sure, but this one is so original as to only be
compared with the likes of 12 Monkeys, Vanilla Sky, Brazil, and a small
handful of others. Enjoy!
