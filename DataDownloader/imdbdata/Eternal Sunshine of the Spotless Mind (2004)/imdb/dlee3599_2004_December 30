I just saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for the first time
last night on DVD. And I loved it. But I have a burning question. It
appears to me that Stan the technician deliberately left Mary alone
with Doctor Howard in Joel's apartment. I cannot understand why Stan
left the apartment. Did Mary ask Stan to leave so that she could be
alone with Dr Howard? Were Stan and Dr Howard sharing Mary? I am
confused as to why Stan left the apartment, knowing that Mary and Dr
Howard had had a previous relationship, albeit knowing that Mary had
had her memory erased of the event. Can anyone help me clarify this?
Thank you for your assistance.
