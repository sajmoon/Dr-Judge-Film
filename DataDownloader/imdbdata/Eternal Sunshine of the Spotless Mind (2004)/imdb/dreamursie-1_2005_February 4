i love the cleverness of this movies script &amp; the old school special
effects are kind of refreshing. no digital wizardry or crappy CGI.its a
deep love story with a slight sci-fi twist that i think we can all
associate with...wanting to totally forget a relationship that turned
out bad. i feel that kaufman is a clever , original , funny new voice
that I'm glad is getting heard , and even though i the movies
themselves may not turn out as good as their scripts are written,i feel
its really nice to see these quirky little movies that are so far
removed from the stale, boring, bloated crap that the rest of Hollywood
insists on shoving down our throats.
