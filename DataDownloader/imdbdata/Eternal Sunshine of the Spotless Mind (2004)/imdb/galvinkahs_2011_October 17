Let me first say this is a fantastic movie. Very original and
interesting. I loved the choice of music through out the entire movie.
This is by no means a romance movie. Although the center of the movie
is about a relationship of a guy and a girl, it is much more of a
gender neutral movie that anyone can appreciate. It is a movie that
makes you think quite a lot so stay away if you do not want that.
Otherwise a good execution of a great plot and idea. My only negative
about the movie is that it took me a bit after I finished the movie to
completely understand it. It left me confused until about twenty
minutes after when everything clicked. I liked it a lot even when I was
a little confused, but once I fully grasped everything, the movie then
became one of my all time favorites.
