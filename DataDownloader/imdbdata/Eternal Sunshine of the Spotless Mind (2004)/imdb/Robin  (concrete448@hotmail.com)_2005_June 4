This movie is like a good book- once it's finished, you need to think a
while and then see(read) it again. The plot line is definitely the
strongest aspect of the movie. Not just being great, but complicated as
well, while things like love and humor are everywhere in this
screenplay, makes this movie so damn good.<br /><br />And....WOW...look at Jim Carrey- He plays drama. At first I was kinda
scepitcal, but now I can see how good actor Jim Carrey really is. Very
well played.. he even has few chances to do his famous facial
expressions in the movie.<br /><br />Kate Winslet.. well, let's just say that I have new favourite actress.
Yaay. She suits the role so well. So well...:) Tom Wilkinson also
played very well in the movie.<br /><br />So what can I say- usually I'm not a fan of romantic movies, but this
one just got into my heart.
