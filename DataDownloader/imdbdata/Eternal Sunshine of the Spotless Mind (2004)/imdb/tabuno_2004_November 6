Charlie Kaufman again creates an amazing universe (&quot;Adaptation&quot; and
&quot;Being Malkovich&quot; that is presented in an equally amazing fashion by
director Michel Gondry. Jim Carrey offers more of his amazing acting
talent, though it is difficult to separate his past acting persona and
his quirks appear in bits and pieces that unfortunately (but only
slightly) distract from the continuity of the movie. Carrey continues
to build upon and demonstrate that he wasn't a one time comedian actor
and he has built up an impressive resume of quality work of a great
overall actor (Majestic, Man on the Moon, The Truman Show, even The
Cable Guy). Kate Winslet offers up a deep, compelling character of
amazing depth and reverberation. Even the supporting cast of Kirsten
Dunst and Elijah Wood provide great, against type performances, a true
reflection of their devotion to their craft. Together, this movie ranks
among the best...in its script, its approach to film-making - an amazing
experience from which one can learn a lot about relationships and the
need to love oneself and to love unconditionally with openness. Nine
out of Ten Stars.
