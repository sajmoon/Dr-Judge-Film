Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the boldest, most heartfelt
and creative film of 2004. Kate Winslet is the only actress who could
play Clementine so well...she deserved every acting award under the sun
for her performance, and Jim Carrey is fantastic as well.<br /><br />I'm so glad Charlie Kaufman won his Oscar for this remarkable
screenplay. This film will be an all time classic...and it will be
studied in film schools around the world (it already has been in some)
Jon Brion's score is so beautiful and subtle...and has wonderful
variations from whimsical and playful to romantic, and excitement as
the memories are being erased in the more thrilling sequences.<br /><br />This film is a masterpiece and Michel Gondry is a great artist.
