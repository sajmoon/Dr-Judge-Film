I don't care if this movie is on more than 50 critics top 10 lists. It
was, in my eyes, a horrible film. One of the worst films I sat through
in a long time. I actually felt I wasted 2 hours of my life I can never
get back. I also know 9 other people who rented this mess and hated it
just as much. The video clerk called this movie a &quot;stinker.&quot; I know I
am in the minority here. But I stand by what I say. I would never watch
this movie again. Jim Carrey cannot do drama. In fact, he is not much
of an actor. He's just a modern day Jerry Lewis. When he attempts to
express anguish, he puts on his typical rubber face expressions. I know
I am gonna get lots of flack for saying this. But I hated hated hated
this movie. It was weird in a bad way, totally stupid, and a waste of
Kirsten Dunsts talents. For those of you who praise this film, more
power to you. I'll never ever watch it again. I thought it made the
&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; films look like Oscar winners. Seriously. Alful,
pointless, and enternally boring. I give it a huge thumbs down and a
zero rating.
