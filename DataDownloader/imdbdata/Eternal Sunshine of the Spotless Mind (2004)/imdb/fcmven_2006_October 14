First, it&#39;s important to make clear the correct plot where a couple is
trying to erase each others record from their memories but they keep
finding each other every time and falling inlove, eternal sunshine of
the spotless mind, or falling inlove, a simile.<br /><br />While you see the movie the story goes parallel to the thinking
process. Complex at first and enlightening most of the time the picture
combines memory, soul and virtue and all the complex heritage of
growing up in family. It lets the viewer take the movie out of the
screen and leave the cinema with the movie.<br /><br />Carrey delivers a superb performance that made him avoid the &quot;Oscar&quot;.
His humor mixed with sadness and all the complexity of the character
made me understand that he is a great actor (before, Truman Show made
the audience give a serious look at this actor) and performer.<br /><br />Kate Winslet, again, delivers a full featured character, a &quot;girl&quot; from
town, this &quot;Shakespeare&quot; actress can do it all.<br /><br />The supporting roles are excellent, specially with a shiny Kirsten
Dunst that returns to her kinky yet insightful characters.<br /><br />A great insightful crazy and round film that has to be watched several
times.
