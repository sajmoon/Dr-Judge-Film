I was just commenting on the TRASH that is &quot;Fun With Dick and Jane&quot; (do
not even consider watching it) and I decided to come and be sure that
this movie was getting the praise that it deserves. Yeah, for the IMDb
community. <br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a wonderful movie. It has a
great script, an interesting story, it's not predictable, and it's
wonderfully acted by all. <br /><br />That's it. No, it is not your usual Hollywood crap. You will not feel
like an idiot after you watch it, like you might after watching &quot;Fun
With Dick and Jane&quot; or &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; or other such fluff. <br /><br />Watch it with someone you love.
