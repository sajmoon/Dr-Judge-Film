This is well crafted and executed, both in its filming and story.<br /><br />Watch this not just for its cool &#x22;what&#x27;s going on&#x22; perspective (&#xE0; la
Memento) but for the storyline and what it says about people.<br /><br />This affirms my take on Jim Carrey, that I like watching him in serious
roles much more than comedic ones. If you don&#x27;t care for his comedy,
don&#x27;t worry.<br /><br />Very slight spoiling here: The last lines (not quoting them to avoid
any actual spoiling) say much in a few words. Eternal Sunshine has the
kind of plot line to happily set us up toward a reveal or twist; it
does an unusually good job of setting us up for lines that makes us
think and consider life. Well done. Worth watching.
