I was somewhat shocked to see that some people really thought this
movie was crap. To me, it's certainly the best movie of the year and it
belongs in my top-five of movies of all time.<br /><br />SLIGHT SPOILAGE AHEAD!<br /><br />When taking a closer look at the bad reviews it seems the main problem
is that some people try to &quot;understand&quot; the film, or they see it as a
sci-fi movie. Indeed, if you see it as science fiction, it's pretty
unoriginal. Erasing memories, it's been done before, quite often even.<br /><br />The point is, this movie should NOT be seen as a sci-fi movie. It's not
about erasing memories. It's about feelings. It's said explicitly in
the movie, they erase EMOTIONS, not memories. So what we see in Joel's
mind are not merely things he remembers, they're things he FEELS.<br /><br />So don't try to make sense of what you see, just FEEL it. Let the movie
swallow and carry you.<br /><br />This movie is about emotions, about love, about relationships and about
the doubts and fears you experience as a young couple.<br /><br />I gave this movie a 10/10, which doesn't happen often*. DEFINITELY
RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />Coren<br /><br />*There are only two other movies which convinced me to give them a 10,
those are &quot;Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;.
