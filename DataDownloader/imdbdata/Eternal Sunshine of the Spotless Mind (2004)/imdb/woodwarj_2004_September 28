i saw this movie in march when it originally hit theaters. it is now
the day of its DVD release and my stomach still fills with butterflies
when i think of this movie. it was by far the best cinematic experience
of my life. the chemistry between the characters, especially
joel(carrey) and clem (winslet), is unforgettable. <br /><br />whenever people ask if it was a good movie, i can only reply &quot;it was a
mind f***, and it was the best sex of my life&quot;<br /><br />let this movie take over your mind and body for and hour and a half,
you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />10/10
