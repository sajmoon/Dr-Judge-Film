I have to admit I went into this movie feeling a bit skeptical
considering I really hadn't heard much about it. But my love for Jim
Carrey is what made me even consider it...and I was extremely impressed
with what I watched.<br /><br />Jim Carrey gives such an incredible performance that you can truly feel
what his character is going through, and they say if an actor can do
that, then they have done their job. Well he was outstanding.<br /><br />This movie actually made me think of all the &quot;what ifs&quot; that I have
allowed to past throughout my time, and I love when a film can do that
for me.<br /><br />It captivated me and I think that if you've ever been in love, then you
have to give this movie a chance. It is totally unlike anything I've
ever watched and through these characters no matter how big or small,
you will find a piece of yourself, and you don't even have to look
hard.
