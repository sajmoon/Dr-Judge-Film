&#x27;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#x27; is a film full of unique ideas,
characters, situations, and philosophy. It is one of the most alive
films I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s a film so full of life and love and graceful
quality. It is a film that is as ripe and as fresh as any of the best
romantic comedies. It is, at times, incredibly funny. At other times,
it&#x27;s just simply heartbreaking. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;ve been in
love or not, because you will get something personal out of this movie.<br /><br />The film basically is about the human desire to want to erase
unpleasant memories. In the case of this film, it is Joel Barish(Jim
Carrey) who wants to annihilate the horrible memories of his
ex-girlfriend, Clemintine(Kate Winslet). The film takes this premise to
it&#x27;s highest potential by placing the viewer in the mind of Joel as his
memories are being wiped out. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play their
parts as perfectly as any on-screen couple has. While most of their
scenes together are harrowing and unpleasant, they are full of truth
and clarity. Jim Carrey has that subtle pacing of how to react to
things in a nondiscriminatory way while Kate Winslet comes across as
more authentic and blunt as she can be without going over-the-top. They
both do fantastic. <br /><br />The bulk of the film takes place in Joel&#x27;s mind, as a matter-of-fact,
and while this premise may sound like it is stretching credibility it
still manages to achieve that rare feeling of nostalgia, chance, and
hopefulness that we all have in our lives. The idea of losing these
sorts of memories is a terrifying idea, but Michel Gondry, the director
of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, knows this and has
strategically added a serious flaw in the film, not to make the film
weaker, but to make the film funnier. Enter Patrick, Mary, and Stan,
three people whose job it is to do the mind erasing. Throughout the
course of the film, the character of Joel repeatedly regrets going
through with the procedure and tries to escape the brainwashing. This
causes these three people who are working on him to encounter technical
problems with their equipment and even causes Joel to enter into a
waking life state in which he is wide awake but his brain is completely
asleep while his mind is being fried. <br /><br />The problem with this is that it is only natural for someone to regret
this sort of procedure while it&#x27;s happening, so these three people
should be used to doing this. Michel Gondry knows this and he knows
that the audience knows this because he adds in a level of self-parody
on top of all the mayhem. This is such a risky think for a director to
try and pull off. Add to that the fact that the film is in
non-chronological order, the character choice of Clementine getting her
brain erased first, and a borderline manic subplot involving a secret
love affair between two of the doctors and a love affair with of the
doctors and Clementine and you have yourself a very complicated
sounding film. <br /><br />If you haven&#x27;t seen the film yet, what I am telling you will go right
over your head. Trust me when I say that this film is a lot easier to
swallow than I&#x27;m making it sound. All of these elements are developed
and played out very carefully and delicately, but not to the point
where any of it becomes second nature. This is a real work of art. It
is Michel Gondry&#x27;s masterpiece, no question. The screenplay by Charlie
Kaufman, as usual, is beautiful in it&#x27;s simplicity. Michel Gondry
really brought it to life though, and that is something of a miracle.
Michel Gondry has the mind of a child. He&#x27;s so full of life and love
and his mind is so open to infinite possibilities. He has taken all of
that, and, with the writing of Charlie Kaufman, crafted this beautiful
and touching masterpiece of film-making, and I can&#x27;t thank them enough
for making it.
