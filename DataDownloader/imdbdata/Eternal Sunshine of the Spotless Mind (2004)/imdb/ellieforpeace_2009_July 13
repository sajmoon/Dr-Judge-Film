I belong to the same group as Woody Allen and Nietzsche. I wouldn&#x27;t
want to belong to a club that would have me in it. This attitude
pervades my life. It includes clubs, relationships, and movies among
other things probably. For example, I hesitated to give this, my most
favorite movie in the world four stars. I thought, since it is an
enjoyable movie, one I enjoyed, I can&#x27;t give it four stars. I wanted to
give it three and a half. But I just watched it for maybe the twentieth
time, and I absolutely had to give it four stars.<br /><br />Four stars does not mean it is perfect. This film is not perfect. I
can&#x27;t describe many movies as perfect. But there are many flawless
parts of this movie.<br /><br />Let me start over with the recapitulation. This movie starts with Joel
Barish (Jim Carrey) writing abysmally about Valentine&#x27;s Day on a snowy
beach after he skips work for no reason and falling in love with a
woman he has just seen. Oddly, she introduces herself to him,
Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), and though she is immediately
strange and exotic and Joel is introverted and boring, they hit it off
immediately. For the first twenty minutes. And then there&#x27;s a snapback.
You&#x27;re ripped from the plot and you realize that you haven&#x27;t seen the
opening credits yet, and you watch them as Joel sobs in his car.<br /><br />And the movie starts in on this crazy plot with purposeful amnesia,
love, and all sorts of other human things.<br /><br />This is a Charlie Kaufman movie, and if you don&#x27;t know what that means,
then you don&#x27;t know indie movies (but that&#x27;s okay. Just make sure you
get to know Kaufman). He is a crazy, insane genius screenwriter (see
Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche, New York) and his mind is
a wonderland. Michel Gondry is a French genius, a director who doesn&#x27;t
seem to direct, but lives within the movie (see The Science of Sleep,
Be Kind, Rewind). Both of them are perfect in the film, and it is great
that they were the two to make the commentary on the DVD.<br /><br />Kate Winslet gives the performance of her life in this movie. She
disappears. Clementine takes over. There is no trace of Kate Winslet,
or Rose from Titanic, or Marianne from Sense and Sensibility. She is
fantastic. I cannot praise her performance in this movie enough. Jim
Carrey also disappears. You forget Ace Ventura and every movie he ever
made. This is his best performance ever. The other &#x22;stars&#x22; of the movie
in its subplot are Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark
Ruffalo. They are all amazing, with perhaps the exception of Mark
Ruffalo, who is simply fitting. But even he fit wonderfully. (Side
note: This movie features my favorite actor and actress, Tom Wilkinson
and Kate Winslet)<br /><br />This movie is affecting. That&#x27;s it. Affecting. It&#x27;s modern. It takes
place NOW, although it could take place anytime. But it&#x27;s odd for great
movies to take place NOW. So often they are placed in another place or
time, but this movie is here and now, in your face, so relevant, and it
has the feel that it could never be irrelevant. The effects are sparse
and perfect when the come, subtle, and helpful, but not a focus at all,
the way they are supposed to be.<br /><br />The music is quite good an fits well. It is quirky and playful in a
movie that is often just that.<br /><br />More than anything, this movie is a good friend. After seeing this for
the twentieth time or so, I can quote nearly every line. I can laugh. I
couldn&#x27;t laugh at it the first time. Now it is hilarious, a real
situational comedy. Yet, it is more touching each time. It&#x27;s like a
fine wine that only gets better with age.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone. Children, old people. Young
people in new relationships, old people who have been married fifty
years. Everyone.
