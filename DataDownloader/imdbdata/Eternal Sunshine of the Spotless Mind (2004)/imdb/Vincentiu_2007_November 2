A fight against fear, love and shadows. Story of a special desire and
ordinary traps. Grey images and gestures in a cold world, after a small
miracle.<br /><br />It is the best character of Jim Carrey. The tension, the bones of
dream, the colors of Utopian search, the figure of another Orpheus and
the final victory are pieces of every man universe, with insignificant
elation, angst or desire of self- destruction. The past is the same of
every person, as temptation to create another place, time and gestures
like pieces of memory. It is a subtle poem about sacrifice and error.
Story of an old myth with another words, with same nuances. Story about
games, looks and labyrinths, about desire and sense of existence, about
lies and trust. About the selfishness and about repentance. About new
day and its warmth.
