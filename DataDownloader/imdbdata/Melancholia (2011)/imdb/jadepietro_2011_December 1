This film is not recommended.<br /><br />Seeing a Lars van Trier film is like sharing a mix of &#x22;awe&#x22; and &#x22;aah,
no!&#x22; moments simultaneously. You are satiated with its energy and
overstuffed with its message.<br /><br />The director usually follows this format: 1. takes a bleak view of the
world and its many injustices 2. showcases a heroine who becomes a
victimized tool and will be punished by society 3. runs a half hour too
long for its own good.<br /><br />His films oscillate recklessly between reality and absurdity. His
vision is cynical and depressing. But his strong use of imagery and
progressive ideas somehow propel the moviegoer through the cinematic
experience.<br /><br />I am sad to report that Melancholia is again one such film, although
now the audience becomes the victimized tool in this case. It is pure
van Triers in formula mode, full of anxiety and fury, signifying
nothing new. It is yet another one of his films about death, despair,
destruction, loneliness, isolation, annihilation, emancipation,
anticipation, hopelessness, confusion, madness, sadness, fear, and
loathing. Succinctly put, it&#x27;s the feel-bad movie of the year!<br /><br />On the day of her wedding, Justine has larger issues to deal with other
than flower arrangements, bridal parties, and menu choices. ( Besides,
her sister will take care of those details. ) It seems that on this
blessed day of celebration and spiritual bonding, the world may be
coming to an end. A nearby planet ironically named Melancholia is set
to collide with Planet Earth. It&#x27;s hard to put on a happy face when
life, as we know it, is about to be obliterated. Naturally, tensions
are high and everyone is at their wit&#x27;s end, but please, let&#x27;s have
some more hors d&#x27;oeuvre first.<br /><br />The blushing bride is Justine ( a gutsy and perfectly modulated
performance by Kirsten Dunst ) and her handsome groom, Michael (
Alexander Skargard ) are at the reception, along with her sister,
Claire, ( Charlotte Gainsbourg ) and brother-in-law, Jack ( Kiefer
Sutherland ), who is footing the bill and becoming preoccupied with the
impending catastrophe, meaning the upcoming collision, not the recent
nuptials.<br /><br />Melancholia is divided into two parts: the first entitled Justine, the
second called Claire. The former section deals with the
manic-depressive Barbie newlywed and her odd behavior on her wedding
day and the latter portion of the film focuses on her caring and overly
tolerate caretaker sibling and both of their odd behaviors. Melancholia
works up the angle of duality, with each sister&#x27;s contrasting
personalities and their separate reactions to the gloom and doom
controlling their every move. But we&#x27;ve seen this role reversal in
other film many times before and handled more effectively elsewhere.<br /><br />Let me add that there is a great film in the beginning minutes of
Melancholia, when Wagner&#x27;s prelude to Tristan and Isolde plays over a
montage of tableaux and slow motion images. If only the director would
have stopped there! That portion is masterly done. But it&#x27;s the other
two hours of interminable angst that one had to wallow through
listening to ill-defined characters, stilted dialog, and long SLOW
plodding plotting. One begins to wish for the world to end more
quickly. Talk about injustice!<br /><br />Where the film totally succeeds is in its stunning and exciting
visuals. Melancholia excels in its surreal and macabre imagery that is
pervasive throughout the film. Special mention goes to the stunning
photography by Manuel Alberto Claro and some of his many memorable
images that lodge in one&#x27;s mind: birds gently falling from the sky, a
bride floating downstream in a very Ophelia-like pose, a grieving
mother clutching her child as she trudges through an ominous landscape,
sudden electric charges emitting from Justine&#x27;s fingertips and her
immediate sense of wonder and calm. <br /><br />Aesthetically the film is well worth seeing, but dramatically, it goes
off course, orbiting in an endless void. So, this film may or may not
appeal to every moviegoer&#x27;s taste. For me, Melancholia creates a black
cinematic hole. Van Trier zealously thrives within his ultimate
darkness, living in his own unique cosmos. He may keep churning out
artful films so that critics may become more enraptured with his
excessive style. To me, this director is sadly adrift, lost in space.
