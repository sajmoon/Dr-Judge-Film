Lars Von Trier starts the film with near static tableaux mostly
involving Kirsten Dunst in a wedding dress. Unfortunately, the high
gloss style resembles nothing so much as a luxury car commercial &#x96; you
know the type that use stylized interpretations of &#x22;precision&#x22; or
&#x22;power&#x22;. After the first six minutes or so that these images take up,
you will think about buying an Acura until you realized you can&#x27;t
afford one). The remainder of the film presents an extended
interpretation of concept of melancholia as Dunst struggles with the
sadness she feels dealing with her wedding day and her put-upon sister
played by Charlotte Gainsboug. Von Trier eases understanding of the
film by using the high-stylized car-commercial cinematography when he
is speaking metaphorically and that horrible shaky-cam style so common
these days when the action is literal. Also, he helpfully calls the
planet on an earth-collision course &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; so you realize it is
a symbol of the Gainsboug&#x27;s character attempts to avoid the depression
that her sister struggles with. These pedagogical touches are helpful
as this is not a straight-forward three-act story arc film. The
shaky-cam story development portions drag and suffer from serious
script deficiencies. The car-commercial dream-like portions are
gorgeous to look at particularly a scene where the moon and the errant
planet Melancholia compete in a cloudy night sky for dominance. Also, a
scene with Dunst naked on a luminous hillside also does not disappoint
visually. In short, not a great film to see sober but if you treat it
like a Kenny Loggins laser light show at your local planetarium and med
up beforehand, it makes for a good two hours.
