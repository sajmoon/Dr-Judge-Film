This is one of those films that you walk away shaking from. If you&#x27;re
the kind of viewer that has no idea what that might mean, then I
suggest not &#x22;wasting your time&#x22; watching this; this film was not made
for you.<br /><br />This is the kind of film that requires an eye from one filled with
empathy and understanding. To understand Justine&#x27;s behavior in the
first part, and to be able to pin-point the passive-aggressiveness and
the avoidance of the party-goers, you must have experienced something
similar before. Lars Von Trier has quite an eye for true human
behavior, and has decided to present it to us in the face of something
we cannot imagine: the death of us all.<br /><br />For anyone wondering why we must sit through the first half of the
film: Justine is majorly depressed. When you first view the film, you
figure that this is all there is at play, just her depression. She is
suffering from a major depressive episode at the time of her wedding,
and it&#x27;s not simply because of everyone in attendance projecting their
expectations upon her. Every single person at the party is attempting
to ignore their imminent doom and put on a happy face for the benefit
of others. Justine chooses to do nothing for the benefit of others,
because in the face of doom, she begins to lose sympathy and empathy
for the people trying to continue on around her. She is being
realistic, while her family dramatically tries reconcile their own
inter-personal problems, perhaps simply in order to help them ignore
the grave reality facing them.<br /><br />It is truly a beautiful display. I praise the first half of this film
alone for the unbelievably realistic portrayal of depression, and for
the lack of understanding the people around her actually have. They beg
her to be happy (for their sakes alone), but she knows she can&#x27;t be,
and she grows weary of entertaining them.<br /><br />The second half of the film presents to us our own actions in a time of
doom. &#x22;Fight or Flight&#x22; washes through Claire, who frantically tries to
flee or hide in any fashion she can from the reality looming overhead.
Justine accepts her fate, and cannot lie to herself or her sister for
the sake of comfort, because no matter how pretty you dress it up, a
planet is about to obliterate any semblance of existence.<br /><br />If you have an empathetic and realistic eye, you should watch this
film. It&#x27;s brilliant. If you&#x27;re a general film-goer who is looking for
entertainment, I don&#x27;t think this is the film for you.
