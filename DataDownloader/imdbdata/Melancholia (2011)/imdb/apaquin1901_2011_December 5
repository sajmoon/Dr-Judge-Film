Lars Von Trier has become somewhat infamous over the decades of his
illustrious career. His films have been labeled misogynist,
misanthropic, and manipulative, as they often chronicle the downfall of
a young, beautiful woman. None of that, though, applies to his newest
film Melancholia - perhaps that&#x27;s why Von Trier himself doesn&#x27;t like
it. Melancholia is his tamest and perhaps most subtle film yet: there
can be no emotional manipulation when we already know the Earth will
die, and the obnoxiously overt symbolism in Antichrist is missing here
and is replaced by a startlingly intimate, human character study. For
those reasons, because it&#x27;s so confined to the real world, to human
relationships, and we can see ourselves in it - it may be his most
daring and stunningly powerful achievement to date.<br /><br />Melancholia is split into two chapters, titled Justine and Claire.
Chapter 1 details Justine&#x27;s (Kirsten Dunst) wedding party, organized by
her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). We immediately get the sense
that something is off with Justine, and soon learn she has a past of
battling depression which resurfaces at her party. The first chapter
ends with Justine destroying her life, at which time we transition into
Chapter 2 and learn that something is coming that threatens to destroy
all life. A previously unknown planet, named Melancholia, is coming
towards Earth, and despite Claire&#x27;s husband&#x27;s (Kiefer Sutherland)
assurances that it will simply fly by, Claire and Justine know it won&#x27;t
- and it doesn&#x27;t.<br /><br />Melancholia has huge promise, but is not perfectly executed. The two
chapters lack congruity and as a result, &#x22;Claire&#x22; drags quite a bit.
Von Trier is also guilty of letting his old habits seep into the film
occasionally in the forms of awkward, unnecessarily primal scenes,
clunky, oddly formal dialogue, and hammer-to-the-head symbolism. His
lack of self-restraint, though, thankfully isn&#x27;t enough to taint his
successes. Even when he gets it wrong, Von Trier is one of the best and
most unique working directors, and while Melancholia missteps a couple
of times it remains another notch on Von Trier&#x27;s belt. Few directors
have the eye for satire and brutal humor that Von Trier does: &#x22;Justine&#x22;
finds the dark comedy in serious family matters and as a result is
every bit as acidically funny as it is mellowing. Von Trier never loses
focus of his characters, though, and he allows the comedy to act as a
backdrop for a harrowing study of depression, rather than losing
control and having it maim the seriousness of Melancholia&#x27;s core
themes. And while Chapter 2 may drag, it builds itself back up again to
one of the most satisfyingly stunning, overpowering and draining
finales in cinema history. <br /><br />Melancholia relies heavily on the use of Wagner&#x27;s Tristan and Isolde
prelude, which permeates the film at all the right moments. The movie
crescendos along with its musical theme, ebbing and flowing with
oceanic power, alternating quiet calm with astonishing darkness.
Melancholia feels alive, it has a pulse, and in spite of Von Trier&#x27;s
occasional blunders, watching it is a beautiful, awe-inspiring
experience. It&#x27;s almost like a poem in its unpredictable shifts in
tempo and tone, layered with subtext, addressing and expressing the
human condition in a way that other art forms can&#x27;t - what Melancholia
lacks in fluidity, it more than compensates for with its haunting
imagery, meaningful symbolism; it is truly an artistic achievement.<br /><br />The film would not be as successful, though, without a transcendent
performance from Kirsten Dunst. Dunst has shown glimpses of her
potential throughout her career, and finally here she is given a role
that lets her show the world what she can really do. Depression this
extreme has rarely, if ever, been captured in film, and she tackles it
bravely and relentlessly. We can see the light slowly burning out in
her eyes, we can feel the disdain, hatred and shame all communicated in
a single glance. It seems that in every scene, Dunst reveals yet
another layer of a deeply complex character until she is the most naked
- emotionally and physically - that she&#x27;s ever been. Her descent is
simply stunning to watch. She receives excellent supporting from Kiefer
Sutherland, John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling, Stellan Skarsgard, and most
notably, her on-screen sister Charlotte Gainsbourg. Their sisterly
dynamic is tangible and deeply explored; Gainsbourg and Dunst make up
one of those all-too-rare pairings that is exhilarating to watch just
for their chemistry together. Gainsbourg&#x27;s outward emotionality is the
perfect match for Dunst&#x27;s cold incisiveness, and it&#x27;s thanks to these
two that the film expresses its themes of duality so well.<br /><br />It&#x27;s true that Von Trier stumbles a couple of times (one sex scene in
particularly seems forced, out of place, and, well, Von Trier-esque),
but it&#x27;s also true that this movie wouldn&#x27;t have worked in the hands of
a lesser director. In Melancholia he has created a near-masterpiece and
a uniquely rewarding experience, a science-fiction film where the
characters and not the science take center stage, a drama that grows
organically from its characters and not from ridiculous writing.
Melancholia is equal parts bitingly funny, traumatic, haunting, and
overwhelming, and is an experience that should not be missed.
