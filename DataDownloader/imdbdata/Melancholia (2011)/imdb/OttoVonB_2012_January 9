I do not mean Nostalgia as a reference to the surreal Andrei Tarkovsky,
though given von Trier&#x27;s most recent exercise, you&#x27;d be forgiven for
expecting to see any of that here. I mean nostalgia for the days when
von Trier embraced his gift as a prankster, and his films had bite. <br /><br />His various cinematic exercises - the vow of chastity in Dogma 95, the
hyper-elaborate stylization of Europa, the abstractness of Dogville -
all had a self-consciousness the filmmaker complemented with an acerbic
wit. You were either confounded or in on the joke, even when at its
core lay a powerful, sometimes lyrical emotional core (Dancer in the
Dark comes to mind, as does Breaking the Waves). Antichrist drew
parallels to Tarkovsky by its visuals, yet with none of its humanism.
It was hopelessly dark, far more than Melancholia, though ironically
the latter is about the impending apocalypse. Much-publicized stories
of the filmmaker&#x27;s impending depression should have been a warning.<br /><br />In comes Melancholia, and here things begin to fall apart. The humor is
gone, except for a few odd moments during the first act wedding
ceremony (John Hurt gives the film its fleeting heart, conveying in a
glance more honest emotion than Dunst does throughout the film). The
hopelessness is there but without intent, without fear or suspense,
without empathy for the characters, we can not feel for anything that
happens on screen.<br /><br />And so, we are left with this frustrating experience, our heart rising
at moments of fleeting perfection whenever John Hurt or Stellan
Skarsgard are on screen, our hopes sinking at every tried stylistic
tic: the pointless slow-mo, the nth repetition of Wagner&#x27;s overture,
and the bad effects.<br /><br />In a nutshell: you can find something better to do with these 2+ hours
of your life. If you&#x27;re in for an arty portrayal of family strife on a
cosmic background, try the far superior Tree of Life, release the same
year and premiered at the same edition of the Cannes Festival. The only
interesting question Melancholia poses is what Von trier will do next.
Will he bounce back in new exciting directions, or is this just one
more stage of an inescapable downward spiral?
