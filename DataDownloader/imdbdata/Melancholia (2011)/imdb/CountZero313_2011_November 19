A family wedding goes badly awry when the bride gives in to her
depression, while global catastrophe waits in the wings.<br /><br />As a Lars von Trier fan, I came with great expectations. The opening is
self-consciously derivative of Festen, but that only upped my
anticipation. The awkward exchanges and stilted dialogue at first seem
part of the overall theme, but then it quickly becomes clear that they
are part of a larger failure of vision. Kirsten Dunst simply mopes her
way through the film, and because we have never seen her do that, it
gets labelled &#x27;fresh.&#x27; The exchange of hostilities between John Hurt
and Charlotte Rampling in their wedding speeches comes off as two
actors having a bad day at an improv session. Keiffer Sutherland has
garnered praise for what is the most convincing performance in the
film. But as he plays a man trying to hold a large event involving
various personalities together, I think his motivation comes less from
the fictional wedding and more from trying to keep the film itself on
track. There is a puzzle to be pieced together - an 18-hole golf course
has a 19th hole; of the three siblings with British parents, two have
American accents and only one British. But these seem random quirks,
rather than part of an overall treatise.<br /><br />The director apparently battled his recurring depression during this
film. It is an awful condition and he has my sympathies. We have all
worked with people suffering from depression. We recognise their pain,
but what we don&#x27;t do is pretend that they are capable of putting in a
good shift at work while they are ill. For some artists depression has
been a catalyst to great work, but for the vast majority it is a
debilitating condition. This film is a meandering, centerless failure
from a filmmaker capable of so much more. I hope he gets back on form
soon.
