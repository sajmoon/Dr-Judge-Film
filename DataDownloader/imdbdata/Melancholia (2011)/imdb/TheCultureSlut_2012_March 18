Melancholia contains some of the most beautiful visuals I have ever
seen. EVER. But what starts as an interesting idea falls to pieces
about 20 minutes into the film - mostly thanks to the craziness of miss
Dunst. <br /><br />Seriously, she is absolutely CRAZY in this film. Dunst aside, the set
up for the film is really cool. I loved the idea of being alone and
isolated with a family during an apocalyptic event. But this film could
have been SO much cooler... <br /><br />I know that in movies I&#x27;m supposed to have a suspension of disbelief.
OK, so a large planet pops out from nowhere and is heading for a crash
collision with Earth.... OK. Cool. I can accept that. Sounds
interesting..<br /><br />What I can&#x27;t accept is when a character simply does not behave the way
we expect her to. I couldn&#x27;t figure it out, no matter how much I tried.
I have never been a big fan of Dunst before ( I thought she was OK in
the Spiderman films and The Virgin Suicides) but in this film, I could
not come to accept her. I&#x27;m not sure it was her acting or her annoying
character that turned me off, but either way, I think I only enjoyed
the parts of this film where she died.
