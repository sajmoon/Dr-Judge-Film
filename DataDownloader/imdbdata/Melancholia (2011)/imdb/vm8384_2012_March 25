Title pretty much says it all, if you want to blow your brains out
watch this movie. Or perhaps perhaps save yourself some pain and just
skip the movie and put a gun in your mouth.<br /><br />Trying to watch this I repeatedly got an image in my mind of the
director staring in the mirror and wanking at his on &#x22;vision&#x22; Would
rate this -2 stars if possible.<br /><br />OK the site says it review must be 10 lines long, not much more to say,
movie is just so negative and boring. The directing is horrible,
languishing over the most trivial scenes forever, OK I get the point, I
got it in the first 5 minutes. This director has done good work in the
past, what happened here.
