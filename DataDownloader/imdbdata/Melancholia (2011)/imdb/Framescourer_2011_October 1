2011_October 1 
A disaster movie of sorts, in which the purported catastrophe is laid
out in an interesting opening dream sequence. This is, itself,
underscored by the overture to Wagner&#x27;s opera Tristan and Isolde. The
scenes stylised in the opening recur in more realist versions
throughout he film - the music is regurgitated at almost every possible
opportunity.<br /><br />The reason I&#x27;m making an issue of this is that it&#x27;s not totally clear
at what point von Trier decides that he&#x27;s telling a story at face
value, if at all. Divided into two parts, the first (named &#x27;Justine&#x27;,
the Kirsten Dunst character) concerns a bride at her wedding reception.
The torturous awkwardness of bitter family and distracted bride
undermining an expensive and meticulously prepared event is punctuated
by Justine wandering off in moments of depression - the Melancholia of
the title. This is also the name of the planet, although it is only
vaguely referred to.<br /><br />The event ends in a highly equivocal fashion. Was it staged for some
other reason than for the couple to marry? There are no answers
forthcoming as the film moves straight into the second part (named
&#x27;Claire&#x27;, the Charlotte Gainsbourg character). This, some time after
the event, seems more concrete as Claire and her husband, son and
sister Justine bring the issue of the planet into the foreground.<br /><br />It&#x27;s possible that the film is all about Claire - von Trier&#x27;s previous,
Antichrist was also Gainsbourg-centric - with the &#x27;Justine&#x27; act a
projection of her fears in a subconscious situation. That&#x27;s a stretch
and if it&#x27;s the case, von Trier has mishandled it.<br /><br />Rather I suspect that this is a two-part tableau of von Trier working
through his own thoughts about this existentially challenging
situation, confronting the value of depression in the context of
disinterested cosmological possibility. It&#x27;s certainly indulgent
filmmaking, the emotional bubbling represented by the excessive use of
Wagner&#x27;s prelude in all sorts of mangled edits (it is perplexing that
after all that he decides to use the hitherto unheard prelude to the
third act of the same opera during the credits). The biggest signpost
towards this compositional onanism is the script, which is dreadful. I
quickly got bored of the now-dated post-Dogme95 shaky-cam too, although
there are some wonderfully composed and rendered shots in the film, it
would be a shame to throw out with the bathwater. 4/10
