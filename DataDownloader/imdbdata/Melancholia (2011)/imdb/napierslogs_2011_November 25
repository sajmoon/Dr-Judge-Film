Justine (Kirsten Dunst) suffers from depression. Claire (Charlotte
Gainsbourg) drives herself crazy over fear of the end of the world.
&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; just might prove to be the end of the world. The film
just might prove to be an example of some of the best filmmaking in the
world.<br /><br />It&#x27;s an end-of-the-world movie, like a disaster movie, but unlike any
that has come before it. It&#x27;s not about the impending disaster but
rather how two unique individuals handle it within themselves.<br /><br />The characters that Lars von Trier has created are fascinating
creatures. Perhaps a little more extreme than most people you would
meet but they are whole in their response to life. Justine can&#x27;t seem
to find a way to be happy even though it&#x27;s her wedding day. Claire is
extremely anxious about a planet that is in a crash course with the
Earth. They are sisters and the dichotomy between them is enormous but
provides such an interesting platform for us to view the end of the
world from.<br /><br />The third character was Claire&#x27;s husband, Justine&#x27;s brother-in-law,
John (Keifer Sutherland). He&#x27;s supposed to be the sane one. He&#x27;s rich
and successful and just has to find a way to manage the insane women in
his life. I thought I had a handle on him, but turns out that I didn&#x27;t,
just as he may not really have a handle on things himself.<br /><br />I would say that the film is much more about the characters than the
story. But, it&#x27;s also about the visual presentation. The colours, like
the poster with a lost Kirsten Dunst standing in her wedding dress in a
background of green, are brilliant and striking. The opening shots of
the film are of the sisters on the final day. They are very bizarre
representations of the sisters and their actions, but in the end, they
leave us with visual cues of what they were feeling.<br /><br />The film is about melancholia, in all of its forms, and with some
simple but effective metaphors. I never felt too sad for the sisters,
but perhaps I connected more with John and I just wanted to find a way
to help them. That feeling, whether it&#x27;s a form of melancholia or not,
will stay with you.
