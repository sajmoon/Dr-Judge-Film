That planet that looked like a flat moon should have hit Lars in the
head. Was it a planet or a meteor? It looked as fake as the rest of the
movie. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay for the ticket. Seven people in a huge theater
should have given me some kind of indication that the movie would leave
me scratching my head, saying &#x22;Duh...&#x22; At the beginning I was thinking,
&#x22;Oh no, another movie like District Nine. That totally sucked.&#x22; And the
only reason I&#x27;m giving Melancholia two stars is for the ending, which
should have happened sooner, like thirty seconds into the film. I
didn&#x27;t like the way it ended, I just liked that it ended. Even my
review is too long, and I&#x27;m making up stuff I don&#x27;t want to put here.
The movie ucked.
