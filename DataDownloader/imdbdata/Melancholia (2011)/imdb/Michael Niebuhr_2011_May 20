Trier takes us for a ride. It&#x27;s a slow ride, taking in the beauty of
the cinematography. It is at once a beautiful movie, while at the same
time focusing on the absence of real love between the characters - and
in the world. The movie hints at a correlation between the lack of
love, and the threat of impending doom that&#x27;s present throughout.<br /><br />I speculate that every viewer will take something slightly different
away from the picture, because the movie is designed to make you think
about us humans and our behaviors toward each other, as well as enjoy
the work of wonder that the movie is. What you end up with is dependent
of what you take to the movie in the first place. Trier&#x27;s movies are
usually adept at making you feel. In this movie you are left to your
own devices. There is no inherently good person to root or feel for.
There is only the state of the world. And the future of the human kind.
Can you be bothered to feel for us?<br /><br />Truly Trier-esque (10/10).
