Melancholia, the title of this film. It&#x27;s an interesting title. I
pondered the meaning of the title, but then realized it was just the
name of the planet destined to collide into Earth and destroy the whole
movie. <br /><br />Pros: -It was a spectacular, spell bounding movie. Stunning,
captivating and simply preposterous.<br /><br />Cons: -The entire first half of the film was a boring. It was so
boring. I was bored. I closed my eyes and dozed off. When I woke up it
was the second part. <br /><br />-The second part was kinda boring too. I was bored. I went to pee
during this part. I just couldn&#x27;t wait any longer I was so bored. <br /><br />-Kirsten Dunst get naked!<br /><br />-This movie was scientifically improbable. It was boring.<br /><br />-The science behind this movie was boring.<br /><br />-Lars von Trier needs to find a better outlet for his manic depressive
behavior.<br /><br />-This movie was boring.<br /><br />-The kid was evil. And he was boring.<br /><br />-Claire&#x27;s husband was always dressed up and he was boring.<br /><br />-The mom was a bore. The dad was actually not boring, but he died.<br /><br />-Everyone died, so you know there&#x27;s no sequel, which is a good thing.<br /><br />I loved this movie, but it&#x27;s definitely not worthy of a 10 star rating.
NO WAY, it was just a little too boring. I fell out of my chair
sleeping. It was a blast!
