If you thought it was hard to hold the camera still back when shaky-cam
was in vogue twenty years ago, you should see this bomb and get a load
of a camera man who appears to be coming off a four day drinking binge.<br /><br />Add to the dizzy camera work a boring plot and...you know what...
forgetaboutit, I&#x27;m not even going to spend time slamming this piece of
crap. See something else. See anything else. See that terrible movie
&#x22;Drive.&#x22; Don&#x27;t waste your time on this movie. Life is too short.<br /><br />Gainsbourg&#x27;s father was a real character and she&#x27;s fine too. The acting
was okay all around. These were real actors! So sad! Do these people
have no work at all that they have to accept roles in this lame and
boring story with the camera that predictably bobbles and follows the
hand from the plate to the mouth and back to the plate and over to the
little boy and back to mom and... give me a break! A 100% shaky-cam
movie does not build tension. It&#x27;s insulting to the viewer.<br /><br />Time better spent watching re-runs of Marlo Thomas in &#x22;That Girl.&#x22;
