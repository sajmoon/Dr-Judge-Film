I&#x27;d have to be on Prozac to get through watching this movie. If not
number 1, than this is in the top 5 of the most boring films of all
time. The first 45 minutes could have been totally removed and cut out
and you wouldn&#x27;t have missed anything. A total 2 hour waste of time and
if you paid, your money also. If I had actually paid to see this, I
would have been extremely angry &#x26; asked for my money back. Luckily
someone else paid for it on Pay Per View or I would have refused to
pay. As far as the Reviews on IMDb, There is no way to explain this
unless they came from people involved in the movie. This is just a bad
mistake of a movie and the director, &#x26; writer should be held
accountable. There, I&#x27;ve made my 10 lines so this can be posted.
