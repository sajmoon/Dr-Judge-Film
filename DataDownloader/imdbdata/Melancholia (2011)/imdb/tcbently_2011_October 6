A large planet is on collision course for the Earth but no-one seems
particularly concerned, least of all Justine who is late for her
wedding reception at her sister&#x27;s large country house. No one listens
to TV or reads the newspapers.<br /><br />Lars von Trier&#x27;s film seems to be the antipathy of a disaster movie. No
one suffers from hysteria for very long and the closest you get to a
mass exodus is Justine&#x27;s sister Claire trundling along in a golf cart
for a hundred yards, until the battery gives out.<br /><br />I guess this is part of the charm; everything is certainly very
beautiful in Justine&#x27;s world. Then in the second half, there is an
abrupt change of pace. The wedding guests leave the mansion and
eventually the house is just occupied by Justine, her sister and young
nephew. They peer at the looming planet through a twisted piece of
wire, to gauge how close Melancholia is coming.<br /><br />I loved the acting, particularly Charlotte Gainsbourg as Claire, in the
film but it is an unusual mix of genres. However, events unfurl at such
a refreshing slow pace that it would seem churlish not to like
Melancholia a little.
