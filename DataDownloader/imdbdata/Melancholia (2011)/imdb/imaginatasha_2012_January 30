Choosing to spend my time watching this poor excuse of a film was the
most ill-advised choice of my adult life. I think that spending 2 and a
half hours staring at a blank wall would be a more pleasant experience
than watching this film again and it is my genuine belief that in those
2 and a half hours, I could conjure up a more inspiring story in my
head. This art house drain of time and money is NOT worth your
attention. The storyline is non-sensical and cannot be categorised as a
science fiction. The performance of the planet was more awesome than
the unlikeable characters than Von Trier has tried so hard to give
&#x27;depth&#x27; and &#x27;&#x27;emotion&#x27; . The characters are completely hysterical and
unpredictable. Thank goodness Von Trier gave us the premonition at the
beginning of the the film so that we knew they would die. If this
turned out to be false, the experience would have been that little bit
more bleak.
