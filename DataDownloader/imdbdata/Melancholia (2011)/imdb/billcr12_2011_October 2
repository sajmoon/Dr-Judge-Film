A bewildering film by Lars Von Trier starts with an endless wedding
reception scene which reminded me of the equally pointless one in &#x22;The
Deer Hunter.&#x22; Justine(Kirsten Dunst) as a new bride seems bipolar;
laughing and kissing her husband one minute &#x26; then brooding in a
bathtub the next. The husband exits the great estate early and Justine
takes off only to return in an almost comatose state shortly
thereafter. Her sister Claire(Charlotte Gainsbourg) is married to
Jack(Kiefer Sutherland) and they live in an enormous house with horses
and Jack spends most of his leisure time looking through a large
telescope studying the planet Melancholia as it nears a brush with
earth. While pondering the end of the world as we know it, Justine
bathes naked by the night light of Melancholia for no apparent reason.
There is no explanation for Dunst &#x26; Sutherland&#x27;s American accents and
Gainsbourg&#x22;s &#x26; her fathers&#x27;(John Hurt) British ones. The family&#x27;s
strange behavior continues to the end as they await possible doom. I
see this movie as a two hours plus version of &#x22;The Twilight Zone&#x22; in
need of some editing by Mr. Von Trier.
