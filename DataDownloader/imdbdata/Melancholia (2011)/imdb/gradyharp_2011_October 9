Lars von Trier is a master in creating films that jar the audience into
a different level of perception. His films (Dogville, Dancing in the
Dark, Europa, AntiChrist, Breaking the Waves) explore the use of stage
sets as though we were in the legitimate theater instead of a movie
theater, uses the camera in a fashion that makes allows the viewer the
feeling that we are overhearing or secretly observing of the characters
the actors are portraying, writes stories that seduce us to think
vertically instead of horizontally, and paints his films with music
that is unexpectedly poignant to his story. Such is the case with
MELANCHOLIA, a film that is yet to be released, one that likely will
have a small audience in the art film houses, but at the same time for
those fortunate enough to see this work of cinematic art it will jolt
into the realm of possibilities about the end of life as we know it.<br /><br />The film opens the way it ends: a planet named Melancholia hidden by
our sun circles into the earth&#x27;s atmosphere and collides with earth.
The extended opening sequence is carried out is gorgeous pictures that
reveal a tranquil stage set as the strange collision takes place - all
to the Prelude to Wagner&#x27;s &#x27;Tristan und Isolde&#x27; (beautifully played by
the Prague Philharmonic with some arranging from music director
Kristian Eidnes Andersen). The two hour film is dived into Part one:
Justine and Part two: Claire. Once the action begins we discover
Justine (Kirsten Dunst) - in full bridal regalia - and her husband
Michael (Alexander Skarsg&#xE5;rd) attempting to manipulate a wedding
limousine to the mansion where Justine&#x27;s sister Claire (Charlotte
Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) and their little
son Leo (Cameron Spurr) have been waiting for hours to begin the vastly
expensive wedding party. Present at the party are Dexter (John Hurt)
this discombobulated father of the sisters, the girl&#x27;s vitriolic mother
Gaby (Charlotte Rampling), Justine&#x27;s boss Jack (Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd), a
new speech writer for Jack&#x27;s company Tim (Brady Corbet), Michael&#x27;s
parents (James Cagnard and Deborah Fronko) and the wedding planner and
assistant (Udo Kier and Jesper Christensen). The party is tense and we
slowly realize that Justine is &#x27;distracted&#x27;: she seems to be suffering
from a form of melancholia and spends her time at the party unwisely (a
physical encounter in the garden with Tim, napping, and always at odds
with Claire and John, and eventually wandering off to be alone, away
from Michael. There is a new star in the sky that the people dismiss
but that some say is a planet headed in a collision course with the
earth. In Part two we find Justine being returned to Claire&#x27;s home,
disheveled, and the relationship of the sisters is more fully explored.
There is an air of anxiety - the time of the predicted collision is
approaching and the manner in which all observe what follows is at once
terrifying and eloquently meaningful.<br /><br />The entire cast is brilliant. Many viewers may find this film a
preposterous apocalyptic vision, many will see it as an overly long and
self indulgent artsy piece by von Trier, but the beauty of the film is
not only in the visual aspects and the musical aspects of the
production but in the intensely realistic view of a truly dysfunctional
family - and perhaps that is the driving force of the collision of
relationships as we currently view them that merely marry the metaphor
of Justine&#x27;s melancholia with the incipient act of the strange planet
Melancholia&#x27;s collision with earth. Do we care to mend our existence,
or do we passively wait for the consequences of now? <br /><br />Grady Harp
