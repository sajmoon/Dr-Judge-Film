No, I have seen worse.<br /><br />But this is not even worth watching. These are two hours of my life I
will never get back. The rating of 7.4 is way overblown. This is why I
give it such a low one... in order to put it back where it really
belongs: as closely to zero as possible.<br /><br />Dunst is not a great actress, and Gainsbourg is not any better. And I
do not understand why Sutherland accepted this role. As for the
director, is reputation seems exaggerated and it must be because among
the inner circles of cinema he must have a lot of connections and
support. I can&#x27;t believe I watched that movie.
