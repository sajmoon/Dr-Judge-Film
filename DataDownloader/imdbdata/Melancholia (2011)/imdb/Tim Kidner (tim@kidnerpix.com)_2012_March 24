I have a terrific respect for von Trier - and love most of his films,
though some aren&#x27;t worth the celluloid they were shot on.<br /><br />Melancholia had quite a hype and pedigree before I got my DVD. I waited
with baited breath. The opening sequences were visual nonsense which
did not impress me much - I knew it was going to settle into the film
proper and couldn&#x27;t wait for that to happen.<br /><br />Almost a replica scene to the Dogme classic, Festen, there&#x27;s the get-
together after the wedding, in the mansion, with awkward speeches and
prickly confrontations. Except we have a collection of
French/Danish/British/American actors all playing leads and all
claiming to be relatives, all speaking English in their own accents.
Not terribly convincing.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst should feel that she&#x27;d been given a juicy and involving
role, one that her career needed, in the same way that Natalie Portman
had with Black Swan. The scenes of her being tired and emotional and
then doing, shall we say, stupid things, reminded me of my favourite
von Trier, Breaking the Waves, where Emily Watson&#x27;s character similarly
displayed destructive behaviour.<br /><br />These scenes with her screen sister Charlotte Gainsbourg were
sensitive, touching and true and whilst living up to the film&#x27;s name
were heartening with their vulnerability and the quality of acting.<br /><br />Not wanting to spoil matters regarding the possible impeding doom, via
an unseen planet, named Melancholia (why name a planet after a negative
emotion?), I&#x27;ll skip quickly over what happens after. Except that I
found much of this enthralling, almost exciting and very intriguing. A
lot of nonsense, some of it, but that&#x27;s the nature of sci-fi - and
trying to mix it with a deep emotional drama.<br /><br />There&#x27;s a lot that doesn&#x27;t work in Melancholia but a great deal that
does. Superbly different to anything that von Trier, or indeed anyone I
can think of, has done before. Dunst and Gainsbourg acted brilliantly
and opened themselves up fantastically. &#x27;Antichrist&#x27;, von Trier&#x27;s
Gainsbourg starring, controversial and frankly nasty previous film now
just a distant, unpleasant taste in the mouth.
