He, I mean Von Triar, is as brilliant as he is irritating. Some part of
me tells me he&#x27;s having the last laugh at my expense. But then, this
film is hypnotic in so many different ways and not all bad. The images
will stay with me even if I don&#x27;t particularly want them to. Kirsten
Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg are sublime, like Thulin and Ullman in
&#x22;Cries And Whispers&#x22; Unfortunatele, their journey comes from the mind
and more unfortunately from the pen of one of the great self-promoters
of the last 20 years. Enough with the hand held camera, please! The
device is not a style anymore but a show of laziness. I have to grant,
however, I wasn&#x27;t bored, I was rather transfixed by the unavoidable
planet enveloped in Wagner&#x27;s Tristan and Isolde.. Kiefer Sutherland
plays the selfish coward, with chilling conviction while Charlotte
Rampling and John Hurt are a delight in a much to brief appearance. If
you love movies you must see this, I think that&#x27;s part of Lars&#x27;s con.
