I had high hopes for this movie. Great cast, director with a great
reputation and an intriguing concept on paper. But the film was a
disappointment, to put it lightly. It&#x27;s frankly a pretentious, terrible
film about terrible people. The characters were unlikable and the film,
when it wasn&#x27;t boring, was extremely infuriating. I&#x27;m still unsure how
I managed to stay awake through the first half of the film. I&#x27;m not
sure I should go into further detail for fear of beginning a curse-word
riddled rant, but ultimately I left this film feeling angry and
disappointed and I, personally, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this horrible film
to anybody.
