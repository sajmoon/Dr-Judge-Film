For the first time in almost a decade we finally get a true Lars Von
Trier film. While Manderlay and Antichrist served only to shock and
disgust, Melancholia actually says something. It&#x27;s not Von Trier&#x27;s best
film, though it has the potential to be one; I didn&#x27;t feel it as
strongly as I did Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark or Dogville,
but it shares a lot of their characteristics, most obviously a
suffering central female character. Unlike the heroines of those films,
though, Justine doesn&#x27;t get trodden on by the men surrounding her, and
in fact controls her own story throughout most of the film. Melancholia
doesn&#x27;t feel as misanthropic as Von Trier&#x27;s previous films - there&#x27;s a
certain affection for humanity that wasn&#x27;t there before. Strangely
enough, despite the subject matter, it turns out to be his most
positive and hopeful film since The Idiots.<br /><br />Melancholia&#x27;s flaws mostly amount to the fact that it feels incomplete
and indecisive, in contrast with Breaking the Waves or Dogville that
were stretched to the limits of the viewer&#x27;s endurance. Melancholia is
filled with half-ideas and intriguing but undeveloped characters, like
the ones played wonderfully by John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling.
There&#x27;s also a lack of decision stylistically. It uses the Dogma 95
aesthetics for portions of the film, and dismisses them for others; but
unlike the impressive and haunting contrast created in Dancer in the
Dark between the reality and the musical scenes, this time the switch
doesn&#x27;t create any interesting effect. I almost wish Von Trier did
without the music and slow-motion for the more dramatic scenes and kept
them naturalistic too, just to see what kind of effect that had.<br /><br />All that aside, I liked Melancholia and I probably enjoyed that more
than any other Von Trier&#x27;s film before; if you&#x27;re a fan you should
definitely watch it, if not - make sure you brace yourself for a pretty
depressing experience, though not as depressing as you might think.
Special credit should go to the actors, who went above and beyond and
surpassed any expectations I had from them, especially Kirsten Dunst
and Kiefer Sutherland, for whom I now have newfound respect. Charlotte
Gainsbourg is fantastic as well, as are all the supporting cast (almost
entirely American and English, this time).<br /><br />One final note: It&#x27;s possible to despise someone as a human being and
like him as an artist at the same time. I appreciate Von Trier&#x27;s films
as pieces of art just as I can allow myself to enjoy Tom Cruise or Mel
Gibson in a movie. Please don&#x27;t pass Melancholia by because of hatred
for the man himself.
