For a movie maker, it is important to have an idea. This idea has to
carry the movie. It should be able to absorb the viewer. The idea
behind &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; does not really. The movie would have failed if it
had concentrated on the meteorite. Lars von Trier concentrates on how
his characters deal with life and death. What makes this movie so
special is that there is no right or wrong. It is the pure essence of
our being: Questions. And these questions are exhausting. And
paralyzing.<br /><br />The movie begins with artistically crafted scenes. They are in the
tradition of the classical overture, in which composers already
prepared what was to be seen in the actual opera. Not only the
atmosphere is striking in these scenes, also the symbolic strength
which is to be revealed later. The film is divided into two parts:
&#x22;Justine&#x22; and &#x22;Claire&#x22;. The first part is stylistically in contrast to
the beautiful, pompous overture. It is Justine&#x27;s wedding party. The
camera erratically focuses, unfocused, close ups, a nice wedding dress,
a comic situation - a spectacle for the viewer. The first minutes of
&#x22;Justine&#x22; are funny. There is even a running gag - but there are hints.
A conspiratorial conversation between Justine and her sister, a highly
depressive mother, who is funny at first but evolves to a tragic
character. More and more details are added which make the wedding party
seem rotten under the gleaming surface - a metaphoric scene is added, a
meaningful tumult of insects in the grass. Justine becomes more and
more depressed, tries to become happy by having sex - not only with her
husband. She is alone. The only person close to her is her sister,
Claire. <br /><br />&#x22;Claire&#x22; shows a Justine who is tired of life. A paralyzed Justine, who
is hard to watch. But who is that sister? Lars von Trier intimately
films her life, her child, her husband, her horses - Claire is someone
who has something to lose. Especially her clever son is touching. That
a meteor might kill him is a very sad thought. It is up to the viewer
to judge whose opinion is closest to oneself&#x27;s: Is it sad that our
planet is destroyed, as Claire feels? Or is it a salvation, which is
Justine&#x27;s position? Claire, who first was the tough woman is the
paralyzed one now. And Justine becomes the strong woman. They simply
swap roles because of the simple essential formula that a human being
has to live and also has to die. Justine does not want to live and is
therefore tragically depressed. Claire does not want to die and starts
to behave just like Justine when she had to live. Justine can die now.
The picture starts running. The blue glimmer is omnipresent. Leo sees
the horse his father allegedly has ridden away with. <br /><br />The picture leaves us alone with all these questions. It is hard not to
identify with Justine. Maybe because she is unbelievably well played by
Kirsten Dunst. In general the actors are amazing. Still, one cannot
immediately leave the cinema since the movie has induced such a
terrifying heaviness.
