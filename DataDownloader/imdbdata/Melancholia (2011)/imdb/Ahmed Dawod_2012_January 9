Please don&#x27;t waste your time watching this movie. WHY? I will tell you
why. First of all, the intro of the movie is very very very very long
and in vain. I mean you will expect that the movie will do something
about this intro in the end but it appeared to be very useless. You
will not understand anything out of this intro. The Justine part is
very ridiculous, the thing is that you should feel sympathy about her
but every time you are close to this feeling she does something bad
that makes you hate her. I mean most of her melancholia is about sexual
things. That doesn&#x27;t create sympathy. The movie events are very boring
and slow. You sometimes need to shout: &#x22;C&#x27;mon I got the point move on,
change your position, DO SOMETHING&#x22; So, I advise you not to watch this
one. I was confused whether to watch this or twilight and now I wish I
had chosen twilight.
