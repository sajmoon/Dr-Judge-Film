Anyone ever play Majora&#x27;s Mask? You know, the Zelda game? Lars von
Trier apparently did. That&#x27;s a weird thought: the nihilistic
manufactured genius of a Danish film director playing a Nintendo game.
He&#x27;s a strange guy, though&#x97;I wouldn&#x27;t put it past him.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />Melancholia involves a planet named Melancholia vacationing through our
solar system. Earth may or may not be in its way, which means that the
end of the world may or may not be possible. Melancholia is basically a
disaster film, though, which means that the ending is determined
outright and that, yes, the Earth is destroyed. This is the cool part. <br /><br />The rest of the movie revolves around two sisters and their immediate
family. This is the less cool part. The most interesting thing here is
that their husbands are, in light of the end of the world, portrayed as
weak and cowardly, and the sisters are the righteous ones who see
Mother Earth through to her fiery end. This is a noted turnaround from
the misogyny of Trier&#x27;s previous film, Antichrist, which was founded on
the premise that a mother would rather experience an orgasm than stop
her son from jumping out of a window.<br /><br />Trier wants to use the end of the world as a metaphor to make some sort
of statement on depression, specifically, that depressed people stay
cool like Fonzie in extreme situations. I guess this is worth
exploring. Honestly, though, when Kirsten Dunst as Justine, one of the
sisters, utters things like &#x22;Life is only on Earth, and not for long,&#x22;
I can&#x27;t take the movie very seriously. Nihilism, I think, is only
attractive to other nihilists, and also, personally, I&#x27;m fairly fond of
the idea of extraterrestrial life.<br /><br />I was really only enthralled in Melancholia when it was ripping off
2001: A Space Odyssey and setting wondrous celestial bodies, locked in
a dance of death in the depths of space, to classical music. I also
liked the prominence of Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s breasts. Trier certainly didn&#x27;t
shy away from them, and for good reason. When Justine strips to the
nude and bathes herself in the glow of the mysterious rogue planet, now
a fixation of the night sky like the moon, it&#x27;s easy to think of her
breasts as celestial bodies all their own.<br /><br />Now that&#x27;s a metaphor I can get behind.
