This film is truly spectacular. I watched it several days ago, and I&#x27;ve
been thinking about it ever since. What drew me into the movie
initially were the amazing visuals of the trailer. As an amateur
filmmaker, I was immediately drawn to the raw camera-work, intensely
slow slow-mo, and the beautiful and lush ranch setting. The entire
movie exhibited the same visual beauty that the trailer had. The beauty
of the film on the visual level alone is almost enough reason to watch
the movie.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I was equally impressed by every other aspect of the film.
The acting was phenomenal. Most of the focus has been on Dunst&#x27;s acting
(which was great), but I believe Charlotte Gainsbourg&#x27;s acting was
pitch-perfect. The range of emotions she exhibited in the film were so
powerful. Also, I was very intrigued by the idea of melancholia, as
exhibited by Dunst (this was a glimpse into Trier&#x27;s own soul, and his
experience with depression). Finally, idea of the end of the world and
the fear of the planet possibly hitting earth, was SO powerful. The
movie, which at the base of the story could have been a cheesy sci-fi
movie, ends up being one of the most powerful and emotionally-charged
movie about the end of the world. <br /><br />Rarely, if ever, have I been so deeply emotionally moved by a film. The
ideas of melancholia &#x26; the end of the world, beautiful acting, and
amazing technical work all work together to make a film which I truly
see as a masterpiece. Also, the last scene shook me to the core. Once
you watch it (which you must) you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about.
