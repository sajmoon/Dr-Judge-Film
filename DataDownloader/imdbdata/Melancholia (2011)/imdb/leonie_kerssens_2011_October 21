I am not a fan of Kirsten Dunst but I went to see this movie anyway
because the plot seemed so interesting. But it was exactly the plot
that disappointed me. An apocalyptic movie can be done so much more
captivating. The movie is depressing and not because a planet is
heading for Earth but because the movie just drags on forever and the
characters do nothing but act depressed and whine at each other. Also
the camera-work is really bad, especially in the beginning of the
movie. The acting was good though and there were some really
spectacular scenes to be seen. So this movie it still gets a few stars
from me but only for that.
