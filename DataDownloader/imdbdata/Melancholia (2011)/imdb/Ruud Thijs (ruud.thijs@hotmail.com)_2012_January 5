First of all I have to say that I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of Lars Von
Trier in general. Antichrist had some shocking and obscene scenes and I
would definitely not recommend it to sensitive souls, but somehow it
moved me. It made me thinking about further laying meanings and
intentions.<br /><br />And that&#x27;s exactly what Melancholia did to me. The story may be
&#x22;science fictional&#x22; but in fact it might be something that really could
be true, even if it won&#x27;t be exactly like in this movie. It could
happen in a different way. Lars Von Trier pictured these scenes in such
a realistic way and ain&#x27;t afraid to face the truth. Something I really
love.<br /><br />I really recommend this movie to all film fanatics that can see threw
story lines and dare to question the meaning of life and subjects that
remain unspoken until this day. A beautiful piece of art.<br /><br />Enjoy!
