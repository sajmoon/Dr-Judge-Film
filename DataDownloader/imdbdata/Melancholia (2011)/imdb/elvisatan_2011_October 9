First of all i really like &#x22;Dogville&#x22; and &#x22;Dancer In The Dark&#x22;, and i&#x27;m
normally not so much annoyed by the use of &#x22;shaky camera&#x22;, but
&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; makes movies like &#x22;Bourne Ultimatum&#x22;, &#x22;Cloverfield&#x22; or
&#x22;Irreversible&#x22; look like a Terrence Malick movie. This has been the
first movie since a &#x22;blind preview&#x22; of &#x22;Liar Liar&#x22; with the annoying
Jim Carrey some 14 years ago, that i had to walk out of a movie. I
don&#x27;t get it...this might have been a decent movie without this piece
of ...camera. And why? To show inner turmoil and despair? That&#x27;s too
simple minded... or as a trademark style? O.K., but ALL the time!!? And
&#x22;shaky camera&#x22; WITH zooming AND out of focus pictures?!! I&#x27;ll probably
have to watch &#x22;12 Angry Men&#x22; &#x22;Kikujir&#xF4; no natsu&#x22; or &#x22;Visions of Light&#x22;
as an antidote!
