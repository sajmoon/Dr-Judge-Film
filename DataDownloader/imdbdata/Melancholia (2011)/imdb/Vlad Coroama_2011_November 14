Lars von Trier is a bloody genius, and Melancholia a sad, beautiful
reflection on the human soul, an invitation to truthfulness, and to
life.<br /><br />The movie is, of course, no light meal. But it isn&#x27;t one of Lars von
Trier&#x27;s heaviest either (which would be IMO &#x22;Dogville&#x22;, and above all
&#x22;Dancer in the Dark&#x22;). <br /><br />It wouldn&#x27;t be a Lars von Trier, though, if it didn&#x27;t think the subject
through to the very end, if it offered its characters (and you in the
cinema seat along with them) a cheaper escape. And I don&#x27;t mean the
obvious level, that there is no Bruce Willis around to place some nukes
and save the day. I mean for example that the main character, strong
and quiet, the only one strong enough to face truth in its entire
bluntness and monstrosity, has to cope with extinction on the most
general, absurd, and unfair level possible. <br /><br />It is always dangerous and unhumble to aim at interpreting the
director&#x27;s supposed message. I, for one, saw the following in
Melancholia: (i) that what truly matters is the essence of character,
not the superficialities of the safe civilisation bubble we live in,
(ii) that apparent strength or weakness within the bubble do not say
much about the essence, (iii) that pride, shabbiness, sacrifice,
treachery, compassion are as relevant as ever in the small scale, when
only very few are affected by one&#x27;s actions, and (iv) that we die as we
truly lived, not according to the surface.<br /><br />By beautifully connecting two stories that could have made two separate
movies (a less dogmatic &#x22;Festen&#x22; and a more subtle &#x22;Last Night&#x22;, the
Canadian movie from 1998), von Trier conveys IMO this last message. It
might be hard to live truthfully, the temptations to give into a
shabbier path large and abundant, but in the end it would be the wrong
choice. <br /><br />Wagner&#x27;s music does the rest. I always liked the prelude to Tristan and
Isolde, and Melancholia gives it the best possible visual appearance,
and is in turn enhanced by it.<br /><br />It is worth seeing Melancholia in a theatre. Only there the music and
the images will be able to protrude you. And only there you can share
the experience. You might not love the film, but I can hardly imagine
anyone not being touched by it. And you might come out, like me, with a
larger desire to live, and to do it - as much as possible within the
constraints of own weaknesses and social responsibilities - truthfully,
less compromisingly, and compassionately so.
