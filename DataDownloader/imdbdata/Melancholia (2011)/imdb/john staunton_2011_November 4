Im not going to rate the movie because all i could bare is 15 minutes
and then turned it off. I can tell you what put me off the movie, over
dramatic arty start, slow start, shaky/arty camera-work.<br /><br />There is a reason why movies aren&#x27;t generally made like this, movies
like this have a very limited appeal. Its rare i turn off a movie, big
fan of john hurt and kiefer sutherland as actors, they usually put in a
good performance, in john hurts case, usually a great performance.<br /><br />Maybe its not fair to review this movie, as a big movie fan and one who
likes to have his mind expanded through this powerful medium, just want
willing to sit through this...guess i should have known by the name.
