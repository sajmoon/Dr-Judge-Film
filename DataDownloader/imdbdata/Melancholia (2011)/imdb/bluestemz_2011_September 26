I had the privilege of consuming this beast twice within 36 hours &#x26; I
think I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t seen a film that dug it&#x27;s claws into
my heart and wrung raw emotion from my soul like that since maybe The
Virgin Suicides (yeah, it&#x27;s been awhile, I&#x27;ve been jaded). Lars von
Trier has a penchant for tragedy, for despair (Medea being a hauntingly
perfect allegory of such) but this is so so much deeper than simply a
surface display of emotion set-dressed in von Trierian style &#x26;
cinematography. The fact that the majority of the movie doesn&#x27;t even
center on the imminent omnivorous title is part of it&#x27;s genius. We
start with a girl on her wedding day going through the motions but
inside questioning everything &#x26; we click, we know her, we see who &#x26;
what she is &#x26; we FEEL her, then over the next two hours as her
interpersonal relationships play out we experience the film as two
acts, the two sisters, Justine &#x26; Claire, but it is not two chapters, it
is one relationship, at its core it might even be EVERY relationship.
Kirsten got Best Actress @ Cannes for this, but its not enough ... I
wish the crew the best of luck this coming awards season (and pack some
meat on the blu-ray please!)
