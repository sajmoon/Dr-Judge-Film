The movie is split in two parts. The first part deals with Justine&#x27;s
(Dunst) wedding party. At first she looks like the happiest girl on
earth but as the night progresses she just loses it, going to the
bathroom in the middle of a golf course of the palace where the party
is, taking a bath in the middle of the party, going to sleep, drinking
nearly a bottle of alcohol, having sex after the party with a stranger
instead of her husband, and in general not giving a damn about
anything. Her too-good-natured husband tries and tries till he finally
gives up and leaves.<br /><br />Justine&#x27;s sister is Claire (Gainsbourg- what does Von Trier see in
her?). How those two are supposed to be sisters only Von Trier can
explain, different mother and father perhaps? Claire is like a
caretaker with infinite patience for all her of crazy relatives, and
all of them are nuts, the father is some happy go lucky eccentric, the
mother is a misanthrope, and Justice is out of it. She tries her best
to save the party to no avail.<br /><br />The second part of the movie centers around Claire, who hasn&#x27;t had a
single good-hair day. Now Justine is completely mentally disabled and
just stands there and sits there like a zombie. Claire is somehow
married to John (Kiefer!), who is filthy rich. They have a son named
Leo. Both John and Leo are fascinated with the event of the night of a
planet passing near earth. Claire is convinced the planet will crash
into earth and takes preparations to exit this life with her family. At
first it seems that the planet is indeed just going to pass by, but the
next morning John notices that instead of receding it is approximating
earth again. Claire gets into a panic, while Justine acts like a calm
prophet who all along knew that life on earth would come to an end,
which is a good thing since it&#x27;s evil, she says.<br /><br />This movie starts with a 10 minute intro of images with the foreground
moving at a very slow-motion. The first half of the movie dealing with
the wedding party is entirely disposable. It is annoying and nasty.
Seeing a bunch of clueless jerks going about being clueless jerks is
not entertaining nor interesting. It&#x27;s like this movie is populated
with a whole lot of little Von Triers playing different characters.<br /><br />The second part is slightly less annoying. The tension builds and is
sustained as the planet approximates and you wonder how will the movie
end. Fortunately the ending is satisfying. Still the behavior of most
of the characters is mind boggling.<br /><br />Not even Von Trier can make a movie about depression and madness
watchable. I don&#x27;t think anyone can. That is not to say that it is
intolerable, it still manages to be engaging. Enjoyable elements are
there: great camera-work, his signature editing, great acting (Udo Kier
rules, again), great imagery, occasionally some brilliant lines. But
it&#x27;s just not enough. The music is obnoxious and unsuited for the
movie. Movies that condemn us to partake in the pathological mental
state of its characters are simply not worth seeing, especially when
there is a reality outside of those minds that is far more interesting-
as in this case of the planet threatening earth. I doubt that this
project would have gotten anywhere without Von Trier&#x27;s name attached to
it. It&#x27;s a shame that while most people have to suffer through their
depression silently, renowned artists get to make movies, write books
over it, and make money. My first experience with the work of Von Trier
was the too-brilliant-for-words The Kingdom. Nothing else he has done
comes close.
