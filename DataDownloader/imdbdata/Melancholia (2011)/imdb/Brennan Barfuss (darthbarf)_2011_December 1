Lars Van Trier seems to want to show us the paradox of mental illness.
During Part One, the viewer easily judges that Justine has mental
problems, and that Claire is of sound mind. Claire is level headed and
tries to make the evening run smoothly. She planned and ran this
elaborate wedding party, while Justine seems incapable of even simply
going through the motions. The wedding is extremely formal and
organized. In Part Two however, the roles reverse, as Melancholia draws
nearer Claire becomes less and less capable of rationality while
Justine calmly embraces the inevitable. Who is crazy then? Who has
mental illness? She who is calm and organized during a frivolous,
meaningless formality or she who is calm and collected at the threshold
of death and the destruction of all living? Which is the more important
event? Which is the time to be clearheaded and rational? Van Trier
wants us to think about these questions; the answers effectively
destroy many of our predisposed notions of mental illness.<br /><br />Lars Van Trier presents these themes of mental illness and the paradox
of how we view it through unbelievable visual scenes and music (almost
exclusively Wagner&#x27;s prelude to Tristian und Isolde). These scenes are
highly symbolic and are open to interpretation, but a couple that
struck me are first, when Justine lies naked, bathing in the light of
Melancholia, and second, when Justine is walking in her wedding dress
and is wrapped by roots around her ankles and legs. In the former, she
seems to have found some kind of peace in the eerie blue light of
Melancholia, as she lies exposed she seems to be whole. In the latter
she is belabored and trapped, struggling to go through the normalness
and responsibility of marriage. Another thing that struck me was the
dual personality of Van Trier&#x27;s cinematography. There are two kinds of
camera work in Melancholia: first; the casual, liberal and often
hand-held camera scenes that highlight the humanity of the characters
and capture unspoken emotions and facial expressions, and second; the
slow-motion, highly stylistic and artistic scenes that take the movie
to a transcendent plain of atmosphere. Both styles are done extremely
well and add to the distinct tone of Melancholia.<br /><br />The acting lends greatly to the movie; particularly Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s
nuanced performance. She is able to slide naturally from elated and
happy to depressed and helpless. Her character has great depth, and she
emanates her mental illness very effectively. Charlotte Gainsburg is
also excellent as Claire, and even Keifer Sutherland (heavily subjected
to typecast), gives a convincing performance as the highly successful,
cold, confident and hard working husband.<br /><br />The most thrilling element of this movie is Lars Van Trier&#x27;s
effectiveness in capturing the simultaneous wonder and fear of the
catastrophe. Think about it, how wondrous and terrifying would it be if
there was a giant planet flying past Earth? To see with our naked eye a
scene only witnessed in science fiction movies and images from the
Hubble telescope? I suggest seeing Melancholia in theaters or on
blu-ray with a huge, hi-def TV and surround sound to maximize the
effect and to fully immerse yourself in the situation.<br /><br />With all of that being said, it is not quite a perfect movie. The movie
as a whole is a little too self indulgent and there were times that I
felt its length, as some scenes were overly dramatic and drawn out
(think of Lord of the Rings). We will, however, be hearing about
Melancholia come Oscar time, undoubtedly for Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s acting and
perhaps even Van Trier&#x27;s masterful direction. I recommend Melancholia
to lovers of cinema and those willing to take a risk on a film. It is
one of the better films I&#x27;ve seen this year, and is a great break from
the generic schlock that comes from Hollywood. 8.5-9/10
