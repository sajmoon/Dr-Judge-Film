Not to ramble strongly for or against this film, I can see why many
people would love it and why many people would hate it. It&#x27;s very
unusual of a movie, has a strong feeling of artisticness, which gives
it an advantage.<br /><br />Unfortunately it hardly has any story or plot and barely anything
happens in the film, as well as the two main parts are totally
incohesive. The first half of the movie is about a depressed sister
getting married, which shows a really strong depth to her hopelessness.<br /><br />However, half way through the movie, it switches focus to the other
sister, where miraculously, everyone else in the film but the sisters,
her son, and her husband, simply leave. The entire second half of the
film really has no connection to the first half except that it shares 3
of the same characters. Mid-film, it switches from a drama to a sci-fi,
and I&#x27;m still at a loss whether to like the idea or abhor it.<br /><br />There really is no cohesiveness to the two parts of the movie, so it
almost seems like the writer either couldn&#x27;t think of a full-length
script and put two separate ones together, or thought it would be
clever/genius to do so. The second part, given that there are only 3
characters (other than a little boy), is dull. The majority of the
dialogue (and there is little) is a back-and-forth paranoid
conversation with the husband and wife about whether or not this planet
in the sky is going to hit the earth. There is no actual conflict,
nothing that can be done about it, and totally makes no sense as a
film, except to convey something apparently profound about the human
soul or something. I dunno.<br /><br />The constant replaying of Wagner&#x27;s Tristan and Isolde as the entirety
of the film&#x27;s soundtrack gets quite annoying fairly quickly. Especially
when it&#x27;s the same part played over and over.<br /><br />Two final things leave me with a sense of frustration/disappointment.
The film&#x27;s climax is the collision of this blue planet with earth and
the characters do nothing in the film other than pointless dialog and
running around. The film ends quite suddenly and while the
cinematography seems beautiful, I really wonder what the whole point
was. There was no story other than what can be described in a short
sentence: Two sisters, a husband and their small boy are at a hotel
golf resort to observe a blue planet &#x27;moving past&#x27; Earth, mostly with
dialog of depression and paranoia, when in fact it ends up colliding.
The end.<br /><br />My final gripe is Kiefer Sutherland&#x27;s character. As an astronomer, he
observes this blue projectile planet and is convinced that it will just
pass Earth by. Yet when he realizes it doesn&#x27;t, he ends up committing
suicide, leaving his wife and young son behind. I can understand fear
and hopelessness and surprise on his part, but what the heck kind of
father/husband leaves his wife/child behind when the world is going to
end, not doing everything possible to protect/comfort/care for them? It
was stupid and didn&#x27;t add anything to the story other than make me not
like it. Not just the character, but the movie as a whole. Why would I
want to spend 2 hours of my time watching dullness and nothingness that
just is meant to make me feel depressed? It&#x27;s artistic and beautiful,
but sometimes making art into a film just doesn&#x27;t work for me.
