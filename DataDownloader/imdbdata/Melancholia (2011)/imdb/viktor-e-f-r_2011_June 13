When you look through all Lars Von Trier&#x27;s controversial opinions at
press conferences he makes movies. Really incredible movies. Actually
it&#x27;s more art than it&#x27;s JUST a movie. This is no exception!<br /><br />After the beautiful 2001: A Space Odyssey-esque start the film emerges
into a picture about good and evil, right and wrong and humans position
in the wide universe.<br /><br />The cinematography is insane beautiful, probably one of the most
impressive cinematographic features. It&#x27;s pure joy to see both the
start and the ending of the film where you heavily can see where Von
Trier had his inspiration from to this film(2001: A Space odyssey!),
this is especially in the start!<br /><br />Another thing there is new for Von Trier is the heavy use of classic
music as a stunning score to this picture, it really fits this film.<br /><br />The film balances on a very symbolistic and deeper meaning-ness film.
The play between the two sisters (one with black hair, the other with
blond) represents the fight between good and evil, and the two planets
displays just the same two things. Melancholia as the good, the earth
as evil, and as Melancholia destroys the earth(don&#x27;t worry I doesn&#x27;t
give anything away, the end of the world is already taking place 5 min.
into the film), goodness wins over darkness, because as Justine says in
the film The Earth is evil! - And then there is something with bridges
again just like in Antichrist, what is it with bridges and Von Trier???<br /><br />After all there is the acting too. Kirsten Dunst plays good, but a tat
overrated in my opinion! It is great for her to win the Cannes - Best
Actress award, because I like her as an actor, but she aren&#x27;t THAT good
in this picture, the character is incredible good, but Dunst could have
played much better! Gainsbourg is good, solid play, not anything there.
Then there is the father to the two sisters, Played by John Hurt, he
played insanely good too.<br /><br />All in all this is a spectacular film about everything and nothing. It
has some of the most beautiful cinematography and some really memorable
scenes, and probably one of the best endings ever! Von Trier for ones
goes for something epic, grandiose and big, and he does fantastic! A
think piece right from Von Triers heart that probably could be a
academy award choice! Existential, essential, ecstatic, stunning,
MELANCHOLIA!
