2012_February 19 
First of all, I have to admit that this is probably the most beautiful
film (in pure visual terms) that I have seen in a long, long time.At
some points, it brings back the &#x22;taste&#x22; of 2001 A Space Odyssey. <br /><br />However the film does not fly&#x85; Why so? Because the film is simply too
beautiful, too perfect, too calculated to be believable. <br /><br />It seems a piano solo performed by HAL. Absolutely flawless in each
single note, but when you hear it, somehow you can feel that there is
no human hearth behind&#x85;<br /><br />Lars Von Trier has left his best cinema well behind (for me, the first
season of The Kingdon and Breaking the Waves). <br /><br />This combination of his immense talent and his even bigger ambition is
probably a &#x22;fatal mix&#x22;(it seems that he NEEDS to come with a new
&#x22;masterpiece&#x22; every time he sits behind the camera).<br /><br />Perfect is cold and cobalt blue. And this film is probably too perfect
and therefore too cold and cobalt blue.<br /><br />Sometimes you have to give away a piece to save the whole.
