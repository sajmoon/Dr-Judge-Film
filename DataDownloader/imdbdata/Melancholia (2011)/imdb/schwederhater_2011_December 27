Truly TERRIBLE film!!! I am critical and dislike most movies but this
was one of the worse I have ever seen. I was waiting for the twist...
waiting.... waiting and nothing.... Basically, Kirsten Dunst got paid a
few million dollars to mope around for hours and show her breasts and
butt for 5 seconds.<br /><br />So what else do I have to say. Nothing so stop reading now but I guess
I need to fill ten lines to post my review. I wonder if that is why
this film draggggged out so terribly? Maybe the Directer wanted to fill
the two hours so people people didn&#x27;t feel like they wasted their money
but all he did was waste my time. Truly worthless but I suppose it
would have made a decent short 20 minute film.
