First off, let there be no doubt Melancholia is an amazing movie, a one
of a kind experience. But it&#x27;s also a strange movie. Strange because
some parts are just so much better than others. From divine touch of
genius to actually really rather bad. There are parts that are so
strikingly beautiful that you can not help being mesmerized, there&#x27;s
superb directing resulting in amazing, almost screen transcending
acting (and this is from the girl from &#x22;Bring it on&#x22; mind you), and
there are parts were sound and imagery merge with such impact that you
get blown away. But then there are parts that feels just the opposite,
some characters are portrayed surprisingly flat and their dialog and
behavior seems contrived at best, almost like they never got beyond a
crude first draft in the writing. The mother and the boss especially
could have been watered down and integrated with more finesse IMO. It
sounds like no biggie but it&#x27;s such a stark contrast to the brilliance
you find in other parts of the movie e.g. the subtle and tender
portrayal of the groom and his love and affection for his troubled
wife. Regardless and in spite of these rather prominent shortcomings I
was sucked in from the mind blowing opening and my emotions were once
again stripped bare and exposed at the signature killing blow finale.
As before with Trier&#x27;s films, I stumbled out of the theater, all numb
and profoundly touched.
