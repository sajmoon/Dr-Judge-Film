2011_November 25 
I&#x27;m sorry to say there wasn&#x27;t more than a kernel of an idea in the
plot. Aside from a handful of momentarily beautiful cinematographic
shots... the shaky, hand held camera work in this film wasn&#x27;t steady
for more than two seconds throughout two hours of this two hour and
sixteen minute movie giving one a Dizzying feeling. Haven&#x27;t we had
enough of purposely over exaggerated shaking of hand-held photography
in films? What&#x27;s worse&#x85; the camera panned violently from actor to actor
in a scene, showing nothing but blur between headshots where edits
would ordinarily be. Dialog continued unabated while the camera panned
searching for the actor speaking. For a first rate cast with some very
notable actors, the end product is shameful. I&#x27;ve never been so glad to
see the end of a movie and only wish I had walked out after the first
twenty minutes when red flags started waving in my head. Save yourself
a painful experience and give this film a wide berth. Russ^
