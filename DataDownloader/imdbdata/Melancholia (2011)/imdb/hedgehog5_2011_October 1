Melancholia is LVT&#x27;s Wagnerian opera. Justine is a mythological
creation. She is the white goddess, Diana bathing, la Belle Dame Sans
Merci, Cassandra tormented by futurity. It ends in Gottedammerung, the
destruction of the world. <br /><br />The Cannes jury was right to honour it. In 2, 10 or 100 years this will
be manifestly THE film of 2011, capturing as it does this precise
historical moment, on the cusp of epochs. More than just an economic
crisis, or even the end of Western capitalism, or the American Century,
or of Europe - though it is all that - it is the consummation in fire
of all we have ever known. Leaders and experts sit mesmerised and
powerless, making reassuring noises, or setting aside puny provisions;
taking shelter in denial or custom. While Melancholia and Earth act out
their dance of death; gravity, the most ineluctable force in the
universe, does its work. <br /><br />Justine, being incapable of happiness, is therefore incapable of
illusion. She has always known. Herself untouched by affect, by human
assimilation or persuasion, she writes the killer tag lines which
manipulate others. Having a damaged soul, she suffers from a disorder
of perception - she sees things as they actually are. She knows
precisely how many beans are in the jar -like those who called the top
of the Dow Jones index, at 12807 exactly. On one level, she represents
the spirit of financialisation, the final, hottest white dwarf phase of
capitalism, quantifying, inhumane, ultra-competitive (seen also in
Skaarsgard&#x27;s brutal ad boss, and in the brother-in-law who paid for the
wedding - &#x22;an arm and a leg, for most people&#x22; -he means it literally I
think - chilling!) And, like the Sybil, Justine wants to die. She wills
the destruction of herself and everything else. &#x27;The Earth is evil.&#x27;<br /><br />LVT is the holy idiot of European cinema. Much as Justine destroys her
stellar career, then hours later, in the garden, consciously and
irrevocably obliterates her marriage and future happiness, so LVT - in
the most perfect example of parallel process - in his acceptance speech
at Cannes compulsively befouls himself, his credibility, future
opportunities, his film and all associated with it. (Poor Dunst, beside
him. Did she always know? I wonder.) <br /><br />Which brings me to Kirsten Dunst.Once the all-American teenage sweetie
in some of my favourite films.(The US invented the teenager, much as
the English Victorians invented childhood, and its richest and most
creative seam of film and TV deal with this stage of life. In a way,
America is the world&#x27;s teenager; and all teenagers are Americans by
proxy.) In fact, Dunst is German-American, with all the ancestral
baggage that implies. (Read Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &#x27;Daddy&#x27; if you don&#x27;t know
what I mean). Beneath the apple-pie sunny exterior of her teen roles,
there was always something remote and uncanny about her beauty. And
now, with teen / young adult roles behind her, this strangeness, this
well, German-ness, is exposed. In the riveting opening shots of
&#x27;Melancholia&#x27; she looks like Marlene Dietrich - unheimlich,
fascinating. Like la Belle Dame Sans Merci, she takes possession of a
man through his unconscious: like the groom in the film, he will follow
her, exchanging all that is dear - home, family and hope of happiness -
for bitterness and despair. <br /><br />In the scene in the limo, the earliest, lightest part of the story, she
seems American, in accent, face, body, She becomes less American , more
northern European, and ultimately less like a human being at all, as
her story unwinds. Those who criticise the inconsistency in her accent
are missing the point. The change is about the character, not her
nationality, which is purposely vague. (In fact, in what country does
the film take place? Would you ask that question of &#x27;the Ring&#x27;?) <br /><br />I get the impression that just as Lars is working through some issues
around his German-ness &#x96; hence the Wagnerianism -, so is Dunst, which
must have made his Cannes performance doubly excruciating. (I hear she
wants to be called &#x27;Keersten&#x27; now, pronounced the German way.) For the
girl who has been being other people superbly well from her childhood,
it seems to me that Dunst the adult truly exposes something painfully
real of herself in this film. (&#x27;Exposing&#x27; is the right word in every
way.) <br /><br />And she pulls it off. The film is stunning. She is stunning, and
thoroughly deserves Best Actress. Bravo, Lars von Trier!
