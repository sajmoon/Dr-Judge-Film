I have never seen a movie so scientifically incorrect in my life. At
some point I was laughing hysterically. From the half of the movie on,
every scene is a rape of science. <br /><br />It was so bad... I never thought I would see something like that... <br /><br />The rest of the story is not interesting enough or believable to make
up for the horror of very basic scientific mistakes. So basic ones!
Unbelievable! First graders can see the mistakes! <br /><br />Another thing that displeased me on the movie, but that is a matter of
taste, is the shaking camera, which made me sick of my stomach to the
extent of having to close my eyes during some periods.
