The unstable and depressive Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Michael
(Alexander Skarsg&#xE5;rd) arrive late in the expensive wedding party
promoted by her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her wealthy
brother-in-law John (Kiefer Sutherland) in their real estate. <br /><br />Justine is promoted by her boss Jack (Stellan Skarsg&#xE5;rd) to art
director and the affectionate Michael is very happy. However, Justine&#x27;s
bitter mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling) makes acid comments destroying
the happiness of her daughter. Sooner Justine is depressed again and
she offends Jack and loses her job and she decides to split from
Michael.<br /><br />She stays with Claire, John and her nephew Leo (Cameron Spurr)
recovering from her break down. Meanwhile the erratic blue planet
Melancholia is in collision route with Earth, but John is calm and
believes in the predictions of the scientists that the planet will pass
by Earth. Claire is afraid and fears the end of the world, but John
calms her down. Until...<br /><br />&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; is a depressive film by Lars von Trier that shows how
insignificant we are and incapable to control our fate. Divided in two
parts, the first one (Justine) shows the relationship of a
dysfunctional family on the night of the wedding of Justine. Kirsten
Dunst performs a character that is not able to be happy even on the day
of her wedding. The bitterness of her mother and the indifference of
her father explain the behavior of Justine. The second part (Claire) is
better and better and shows how vulnerable the human race is.<br /><br />The cinematography and soundtrack of &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; are very beautiful.
Lars von Trier is among my favorite directors and once again he makes
an original and beautifully crafted movie. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): &#x22;Melancolia&#x22; (&#x22;Melancholia&#x22;)
