This movie got all what it takes to be one special movie. It is about
the willingness and perseverance of Lars Von Trier to dig into the
abyss of the uncommon part of the humanity. The first part of the movie
may seem slow and a bit confusing, but actually it takes the time that
it needs to perfectly sculpt the world seen from the point of view of a
melancholic person. I really believe that we all got a bit of
melancholia inside us, we all (more or less) suffer of melancholia...
in the deepness of us.<br /><br />The second part, it&#x27;s the movie. Yes! The melancholia you&#x27;ve seen in
the trailer. It&#x27;s about love, courage and the mental powerfulness of
human being mainly interpreted by the French actress Charlotte
Gainsburg. The devoting sister who have to take care of her sister
Justine while the Earth is about to experiment a collision with an
alien Planet.<br /><br />In a few words, this movie provides positive and uncomfortable
emotions. It&#x27;s a silent &#x22;end of the world movie&#x22; where the devastating
chaos takes place in the mind of the viewer. It&#x27;s art by Lars...can&#x27;t
say more really. I loved it!
