I won&#x27;t add much to what was already said.<br /><br />The movie is great. The acting really is fantastic, all actors are
really wonderful, I particular liked Charlotte Rampling part.<br /><br />The plot is interesting, the character psychology quite deep.<br /><br />Last, the photograph is great. Beautiful pictures from start to the
end.<br /><br />The only reason why I give this movie a 9 and not the perfect 10, is
the signature Lars Von Trier&#x27;s always moving camera. At times, I
thought I&#x27;d really like him to use a tripod and stop making ugly pans,
because I nearly got dizzy :)
