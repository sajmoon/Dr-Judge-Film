Review of Melancholia Recommendation: Avoid at all cost.<br /><br />Why? It&#x27;s an art movie. It&#x27;s a pretentious art movie. It&#x27;s an annoying
pretentious art movie.<br /><br />The opening scene is some kind of avant garde photographic opus.
Complete with loud orchestral music. During the wedding dinner, the
photography was terribly obtrusive. The DOP (Director of Photography)
showcased his shaky hand-held camera skills.<br /><br />It was annoyingly shaky and distracted from the dialogue. Moreover, the
camera kept zooming unnecessarily.<br /><br />Walked out after 30 minutes and dropped in on a showing of Immortals.
Now, there was some decent CGI and plot.<br /><br />IMO, the art movie seems pretentious when presenting human emotions.
This film really turned me off.
