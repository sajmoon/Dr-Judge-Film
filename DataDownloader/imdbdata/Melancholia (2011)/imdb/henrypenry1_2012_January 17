I&#x27;m quite shocked that the rest of the reviewers average a 7/10.
Melancholia is the most unwatchable movie I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. I&#x27;m
not easily bored and I don&#x27;t give up early, but I could sense in the
first 5 minutes of endless, random, slow motion scenes that with
nothing but dramatic classical music at 150 dB to help it....that I was
in for a long night of pretentious bullshit. Besides the pervasive dull
pace, the Dunst&#x27;s character and many others were simply inane...and
unintentionally. Scene after scene could not be swallowed. The
eye-candy CGI of the planets colliding was not the gist and not
spectacular, but still the bright spot of a dimly lit and dimly acted
effort to present a theatrical/cosmological metaphor for a doomed soul.
I wouldn&#x27;t even recommend buying this on VHS for $1 at a yard sale.
