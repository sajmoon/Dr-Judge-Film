Firstly, amazing work of art. Secondly, even I, a sensitive&#x26;sensible
person with strong nerves, having seen almost all of the movies out
there, felt literally sick and terrified all through the movie. I felt
truly anxious for the first time in my life. I can imagine someone with
depression who d watch it would become suicidal. Beware! A very serious
movie that will get under your skin all right! Acting 10/10, human
relationships portrayed 10/10, realism 11/10. Did I want to cry? No. So
no, it is not a drama. It is something beyond a movie- a summary of our
miseries in this world. It is to be lived through, not felt for. Enjoy,
but if I had choice, I d rather not watch- too much stress. P.S. So far
I don&#x27;t find any other movie to compare. Maybe just the English Patient
got so much to me, but totally different buttons were pressed as it is
totally different genre.
