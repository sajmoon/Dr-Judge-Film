Melancholia for me was an excellent illustration of a feeling. Having
been extremely melancholic at one point in my life I definitely felt
taken back by it and reminded of those feelings. I&#x27;d draw a strong
distinction between melancholia and depression (having had both).
Depression for me would be characterised by thoughts such as, &#x22;Things
never going my way&#x22;, and is very much mixed with anxiety, &#x22;Can&#x27;t get a
moment&#x27;s peace to think about my problems&#x22;. Melancholia is very
different, and has, in a way, a richness to it, which for example is
reflected when Justine (Kirsten Dunst) bathes in the light of the
planet Melancholia. You can get a feeling of peace say by thinking, &#x22;I
accept that the world is fundamentally rotten&#x22;, or, &#x22;It would be a very
good and right thing if the world were to turn to ashes&#x22;. Melancholic
thoughts like these generally seems to happen at periods in your life
when you have a lot of time for reflection. I think you can definitely
be nostalgic about melancholy. I&#x27;m nostalgic for my student days, for
climbing into bed at midday on a Wednesday and listening to Satie,
impassive tears. The film in general reminds me of a song lyric from my
youth, from Soundgarden, &#x22;Black hole sun won&#x27;t you come and wash away
the rain&#x22;.<br /><br />It&#x27;s Justine&#x27;s wedding day and she relapses into a melancholy that
(it&#x27;s hinted) pockmarked her childhood. Why does this happen?
Melancholy is experienced not because of one&#x27;s own failings (&#x22;I&#x27;m not
clever enough to pass this exam&#x22;, &#x22;I couldn&#x27;t make the football team&#x22;),
but due to the world being shabby compared to fairy tales and dreams,
your idols falling as you grow up, realisations that love is often
selfish and mere lust in disguise, that people are vain and egotistical
and self-serving, that commerce is degrading and inimical. Justine
surely a reference to the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s character of the same name,
a virtuous ingenue who is subjected to abuse at every turn. Upon rescue
from the the sins of the world she succumbs to depression and is struck
dead by a bolt of lightning.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a pure form of depression, it comes to Justine even though she is
beautiful, marrying Michael, a wealthy and handsome man, has been
promoted at work, and is in the middle of a magnificent wedding.<br /><br />As in Antichrist, Lars von Trier shows us the dark lines of the chasm
between men and women. Justine craves spontaneity, and amity (just as
Jack thrives on hostility), Michael is wrapped up in his super-ego
(Freud suggested this was much stronger in men), John trusts in
science.<br /><br />There&#x27;s an aesthetic to the trajectory of the planet Melancholia (the
dance of death), and melancholy is also here associated with higher
knowledge (Justine is aware of exactly how many seeds are in a jar
without counting). It may be apt to compare the film to Albrecht
D&#xFC;rer&#x27;s famous engraving Melancholia I, which echoes this, there&#x27;s an
awkward shaped solid in the image (note the awkward angles of the trees
in the garden of von Trier&#x27;s Melancholia), and also a square of jumbled
numbers. However the shape is a special one called D&#xFC;rer&#x27;s solid, all
points of which can be fitted to a sphere, and the numbers are not only
part of a magic square, but also list the date of the engraving&#x27;s
production. Melancholy both unshapely and sublime.<br /><br />Melancholia for me was a calming and beautiful experience for me, like
Justine, I rediscovered the comfort of eating jam neat from the jar,
comme un ours! (And also the comfort of not caring if the world ends).
