I was apprehensive about seeing this film. I&#x27;m a fan of Kirsten Dunst,
but not fanatically so. I&#x27;m not that familiar with the works of Lars
Von Trier. But, festival pre-speak of the film intrigued me so, last
night, when I saw it listed in Comcast&#x27;s On-Demand line-up I shelled
out the ten bucks for the film. I don&#x27;t regret it.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I can understand that many will not
appreciate the slow pace. But, I was consumed and mesmerized by the
visual content and style of the film. The colors, lighting, time
manipulation, and even the pageantry, drew me in and fascinated me.<br /><br />It&#x27;s difficult to talk about the story without releasing spoilers. (And
I don&#x27;t want to do that.) But I feel two performances stand out and
deserve mention: Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s and Keifer Sutherland&#x27;s.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst was simultaneously radiant and nuanced. There were times
when she was startlingly drab. Her role was the anchor post that bound
the entire film together. I enjoyed her performance in this film even
more than her performance in &#x22;Cat&#x27;s Meow&#x22;, which is saying a lot from
me.<br /><br />The other performance that stood out to me was that of Keifer
Sutherland. The role he played was understated and peripheral. But it
led you to a certain conclusion about the character of the man he was
portraying. Thus, the final reveal of his character was unexpected.<br /><br />In whole, I found &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; to be a pageant of visual imagery and
nuanced character interaction. If you&#x27;re looking for a sci-fi action
fest, look elsewhere. But if you appreciate pure artistry on a
cinematic canvas then I suspect you will enjoy this film. My final
statement is that I went to bed and dreamed about &#x22;Melancholia&#x22;. And,
when I woke up this morning I was still replaying the film in my mind&#x27;s
eye. That doesn&#x27;t happen very often.
