Lars von Trier is an interesting filmmaker.. but I still have great
trouble with his movies. Dancer in the Dark was pretty good, Dogville
was crap (not due to the nice stage setting but due to the narrator
having to be the one to add any emotion to the film) and I kinda
enjoyed The Kingdom.<br /><br />So here&#x27;s Melancholia, getting great reviews. So what the heck, let&#x27;s
see it, Dunst is a great actress, Gainsborough, Hurt, Sutherland,
Rampling... all great actors.<br /><br />So what starts with a visual treat in the fits minutes, turns into a
Festen-like wedding but one where nothing really happens... And then
more doesn&#x27;t happen and more... The shaking camera seems to be shaking
for the sake of shaking a lot, but then that is the Dogma style, which
is getting rather stale by now.<br /><br />To make sure, I am also not a teenager into TF (in fact TF2 must be the
most stupid movie ever made). And I like slow movies if they take me
along. Kurosawa made slow movies, but with a great climax that made it
all worthwhile... I love Terence Malick&#x27;s films and especially enjoyed
the director&#x27;s cut of The New World (which is a low slower than the
theatrical) but these movies take you into a world, and atmosphere...
they make you part of the world of the main characters. <br /><br />But in Melancholia, there&#x27;s just slowness... it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere,
nobody does anything and that weird planet keeps changing colour from
green to blue. All Von Trier tells us is what it&#x27;s like to be
depressed... well, we got that. But that was all... and that kinda
depressed me.<br /><br />It has a few stunning shots, but the movie left no impression at all.
And honestly. I don&#x27;t understand why people love it so, except maybe
for the sake that is different from average Hollywood films. But still,
especially in this case, form does not win over substance.<br /><br />Too bad... on to the next one.
