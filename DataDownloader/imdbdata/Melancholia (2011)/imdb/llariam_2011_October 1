I was not aware of the &#x22;disastrous interview&#x22; people referred to here,
neither of the public reception or what any professional critics think
about the movie... I merely watched it:<br /><br />Writing about it long-windedly would give it more credit then it
deserves, thus merely this: <br /><br />Contains a few very pretty pictures of a planet approaching Earth. <br /><br />Beyond that, the movie fails to touch on either the intellectual,
emotional or spiritual level. It seems someone tried to produce &#x22;art&#x22; -
which is per definitionem always relative - but definitely tried much
too hard.
