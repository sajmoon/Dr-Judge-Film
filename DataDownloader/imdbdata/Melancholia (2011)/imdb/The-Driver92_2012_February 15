Melancholia totally absorbed me. It had me from the first moment to
well after the credits rolled. Every frame was sumptuous and beautiful.
Loved the music throughout. The 10 seconds or so of black nothingness
at the end.<br /><br />Amazing contrasts - a wedding and the possible end of the world,
depression and beauty. Kirsten Dunst was amazing. Great colorful
characters in her folks, boss, brother- in-law Kiefer S, and the
dysfunction between them all. Interesting how the entire thing takes
place at this castle/estate, which becomes increasingly cut off from
the rest of the world, with fewer and fewer characters as the movie
goes on.<br /><br />It seems that every detail in this film was well thought out and quite
intentional. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get more out of it on the second viewing.<br /><br />You&#x27;ll see lots of 10-star reviews here but also many 1- or 2-star
reviews. I respect the opinions of people who did not like this film.
It is not for everyone. It&#x27;s a film about depression and about the
possible end of the world, so many will see this film as a total downer
(though, strangely, I felt pretty good after it was over - watching it
was cathartic and visceral for me).<br /><br />Also, the story moves very slowly. The film is as much about mood and
visuals as about plot, and maybe more so. I really couldn&#x27;t blame
anyone who dislikes films that are so slow.<br /><br />Yet, there are many folks out there who appreciate a film like this,
who will be completely absorbed and blown away by Melancholia. If
you&#x27;re this kind of viewer, I can&#x27;t recommend it strongly enough.
Watching it is a very deep, emotional experience.
