Lars Von Trier shows in this film how daring and different he is. with
subject matter most stunning to the mind and the consciousness, the
film examines with limitless care the human psyche when waiting for the
tragedy of death, symbolized by the imminent end of the world. but the
film is not about that: the end of the world, or how they can stop the
planet, Melancholia, from colliding with Earth by detonating a nuclear
head, blended with cheap romantic subplots or any other sci-fi clich&#xE9;
there is..<br /><br />the opening sequence is my favorite part of the film: a composition of
dreamlike succession of extremely slow motion images of main characters
and a giant planet approaching Earth, eventually destroying it in a
planetary collision; working perfectly as a prologue. running just a
little under 8 minutes, the opening sequence is absolutely one of my
very favorite cinematic moments of the year. it superbly captures the
essence of the film and its themes, and a magnificent score to match
the grandiose of the moment. i just wanna have those 8 minutes in my
possession so i can see it whenever i feel like it<br /><br />the film then is split into two parts: the first is from Justine&#x27;s
point of view, played brilliantly by Kirsten Dunst, as a bride, we
watch her get increasingly depressed as the movie progresses, while
maintaining a stronger response to the impending disaster. the second
is from Justine&#x27;s sister, Claire&#x27;s point of view, played also
brilliantly by Charlotte Gainsbourg, a mother who can&#x27;t protect her son
gets increasingly agitated and fearful. during the wedding, we see an
uncommonly dysfunctional family, and a bunch of characters that, to me,
seem very desolate and lifeless, stuck in their own personal lives,
apathetic to their destiny.. the film, though, has point in portraying
them like that, juxtaposing their blinded, empty, indifferent journey
through life to that of Justine&#x27;s neurotic, silent, obsession about
death.. either way, it is impossible to fully realize one&#x27;s life
knowing that death is waiting. which is ironic since life is basically
a journey to death.. and that is the big picture, i guess<br /><br />the film is very symbolic in that sense, which is apparent once more in
the final scene, also one of my favorites. Justine, Claire and her son
take shelter in a tent made out of wooden sticks, holding hands with
each other waiting for the inevitable; Claire is fearful, Justine is
accepting while the kid is having his eyes closed..<br /><br />as you can tell, the film really worked for me. and if it wasn&#x27;t for
some flaws, it would have been one of my all-time favorites. the flaws
being that in a lot of times the film just seems too cold and distant
for me to be engaged in. and i don&#x27;t think i would like some of the
boring wedding scenes more upon a second view..
