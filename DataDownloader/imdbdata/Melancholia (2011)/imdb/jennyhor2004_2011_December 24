&#x22;Melancholia&#x22;, is Lars von Trier&#x27;s beautifully realised contribution to
the sci-fi apocalyptic fantasy / black comedy movie genre. The film
continues ideas from &#x22;Antichrist&#x22; concerning the nature of the universe
and humankind&#x27;s insignificance within an indifferent cosmos: all the
knowledge, science and religious faith we can muster won&#x27;t help us
solve our own problems and certainly won&#x27;t help us survive a collision
with a stray extra-solar planet. The only thing we can do is face the
certainty of annihilation with the serene and passive calmness born of
depression and lack of hope: a despairing message, yes, but one that&#x27;s
perhaps more reasonable than trusting in a non-existent God or belief
systems that so far haven&#x27;t delivered on their promises of benefitting
humans across the Earth.<br /><br />Eight minutes of silent slow-motion visual beauty in which the film&#x27;s
main characters and motifs appear in haunted nature tableaux to the
music of Richard Wagner&#x27;s prelude to the opera &#x22;Tristan und Isolde&#x22;
form the extended introduction. (The music repeats throughout the film
to overwrought drama-queen effect.) Allowing for possible inaccuracies
and bad science in the collision scene creation &#x96; after all, no-one&#x27;s
ever witnessed anything the same or similar and lived to tell the tale
&#x96; I find this perhaps the most gorgeous and poetic summation of the
film&#x27;s concerns.<br /><br />What follows after is a footnote character study of two sisters and how
they cope with life and the knowledge that everything that&#x27;s hit them
before which they survived won&#x27;t help in a Final Judgement. The first
half of &#x22;Melancholia&#x22;, labelled &#x22;Justine&#x22;, follows bride Justine
(Kirsten Dunst) and new hubby Michael (Alexander Skarsg&#xE5;rd) arrive a
little too fashionably late for their reception thrown by Justine&#x27;s
sister Clare (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her rich husband John (Kiefer
Sutherland). The reception lasts most of the day and into the night but
it&#x27;s not a happy one: Justine&#x27;s estranged Mum and Dad (Charlotte
Rampling and John Hurt) disgrace themselves; Justine&#x27;s boss (Stellan
Skarsg&#xE5;rd) trails her for advertising copy; and John whines constantly
about how much money the reception is costing him and Justine had
better be happy and grateful for his generosity. Justine becomes
depressed: her parents show no sympathy but remain self- obsessed, her
boss attempts to manipulate her and corporate invertebrate Michael is
incapable of understanding Justine and her problem family. By the end
of the evening and the dawn of a new day, Justine has told off her boss
for the prick he is and her parents and new husband have abandoned her.<br /><br />In the second half, titled &#x22;Clare&#x22;, the film targets Clare and John in
their reaction to the news of the looming collision between Earth and
Melancholia. Justine has descended into full-blown depression. Although
John attempts to protect Clare and their son (Cameron Spurr) from the
dreadful news about Melancholia, he ends up giving in to despair.
Justine accepts the news of Earth&#x27;s demise with calm and serenity and
Clare bounces from helplessness to headless-chook panic and action to
fruitless religious &#x22;ritual&#x22;.<br /><br />Apart from Justine herself, delivered by Dunst in a sterling
performance in which her blank face masks a million-and-one emotions
and thoughts, the acting is cardboard cut-out cartoonish: Rampling
redefines snarling bitterness and sarcasm, Hurt sleepwalks through his
role as feckless womaniser and Sutherland&#x27;s character is a mere
whingeing rich- boy unable to have a decent civilised conversation with
his wife or sister-in-law. Gainsbourg, looking gaunt and nervy, nails
the panicky sister down pat. The cinematography, jumpy and amateurish
in the style of a home videorecording, throws viewers&#x27; attention onto
the to-ings and fro-ings of the characters as they grapple with belief
and faith in science and the reality of what&#x27;s happening in the sky. It
might be said that the choice of filming style is unfortunate for the
subject matter and is ultimately the film&#x27;s downfall: the camera really
should have kept still most of the time and all the characters
portrayed in a remote way as though in a diorama setting that shows off
Clare and John&#x27;s palatial home and the surrounding forests and other
greenery. Clare and John would then be seen as symbols of a helpless
hysterical elite that has no more idea about how to deal with global
crises than we plebeians do. As it is, we lose sight of what
&#x22;Melancholia&#x22; is telling us about human society and its
self-centredness in a world and universe that demand our attention more
than ever, and the film becomes a fussy study of shallow rich people.
Depression becomes one character&#x27;s way of realising that humankind
lives in fantasy where having a dream job, a dream spouse and a dream
family and home turn out to be unfulfilling and oppressive: depression
becomes a kind of escape and freedom.<br /><br />I did not find &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; at all depressing or pessimistic and there
are actually frequent moments of deep black humour throughout the film.
The look is beautiful and the themes are deep and worthy of attention;
shame that the film is not tighter in its narrative and the camera
style is completely wrong for the film&#x27;s subject and themes. The
science could have been a lot better: where are the earthquakes,
over-blowing volcanoes and tsunamis that should have been the result of
the intense gravitational attractions, what happened to the atmosphere
burning up as the planet Melancholia draws near, does Earth get knocked
out of its trajectory around the Sun, what about all the conservative
politicians and the geologists and engineers in the pay of mining
companies trying to convince us all that Melancholia doesn&#x27;t exist or
won&#x27;t endanger Earth even though the evidence is 99.9% against them? As
John says in the film, we should allow for a margin of error.
