Wow.. and 20 to 30 seconds of total silence in the theater until you
finally realize you have to breath. That is what happened at the end of
the movie to all people watching this latest masterpiece by Lars von
Trier.<br /><br />This is not an easy movie to digest. It will make you think about it
for the next hours and even days.<br /><br />The first ten minutes of the movie are like watching a Dali painting.
The music of the Prelude from Tristan and Isolde by Wagner adds
undoubtedly to the mood. I realized my hands were cold like ice after
that part of the movie. Then you have about 10 minutes to relax while
seeing a romantic and funny scene after which Von Trier sucks you right
into the deep, dark places of the human mind.<br /><br />Part 2 is even more impressive with the threat which becomes more
imminent every minute. The way everyone deals with the situation is so
disturbing, so real life.. There is no escape, nowhere to go, no way to
protect you loved ones. Von Trier does a perfect job to show this
despair.<br /><br />Apart from the intriguing story the movie is a piece of art. The scene
with the moon and Melancholia showing yellow and blue light on the
grass, the horses, the hail falling on the golf course.. wow..<br /><br />OK, as you might read I am very impressed by this movie. Great acting,
art-like images, great music and an intriguing story. I cannot recall
another movie that has had this effect on me in a long time.<br /><br />10/10.. no doubt about it!
