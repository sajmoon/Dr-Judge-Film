Lars Von Trier is a genius. His films have a very unique quality to
them. He manages to tell stories that are immensely entertaining while
at the same time still being utterly unique and artistic. Melancholia
is absolutely stunning. It works on so many different levels it has to
be seen. Words cannot do it justice. Literally. There are scenes in
this film that visually have never really been attempted and certainly
not achieved with such grace. And yet the central story and the acting
are so good that the movie would be completely engrossing even without
the end of the world aspect, but throw that into that mix and you have
a movie that has truly done something on a grand scale. Evoking a wide
array of emotions while at the same time raising interesting and
profound questions about life, depression, family, and the end of the
world.
