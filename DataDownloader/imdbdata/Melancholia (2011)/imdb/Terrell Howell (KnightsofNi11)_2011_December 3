When a planet is headed on a crash course towards Earth what do you do?
You lay down in a pond full of lily pads, that&#x27;s what you do according
to Lars von Trier&#x27;s new apocalyptic art film, Melancholia. Kirsten
Dunst stars as Justine, a young woman whose wedding reception is not
going entirely as planned. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays her sister,
Claire. The film follows the relationship of these two sisters as they
prepare for a planet called Melancholia to crash into the earth,
destroying everything. It begins on the night of Justine&#x27;s wedding
reception as things slowly start to fall apart due to the impending
doom heading for Earth. The film is a visual wonder, yet the story
isn&#x27;t as thorough as you would expect.<br /><br />Melancholia is a unique film that chronicles the end of the world in
its own very special way. There is a lot going on in this film with the
story surrounding Justine and Claire and how these characters evolve as
Melancholia gets closer and closer to Earth. Yet, this film seems to
boil down to nothing more than two sisters and their reactions to the
end of the world and the way they cope with it. I searched for hidden
symbolism and creative nuance that would make this story more than
that, but I was not successful in my search. I really feel like there
was no more to this film than what you can easily make of it. Perhaps
there doesn&#x27;t need to be and my expectations were just set too high,
but with all the strange occurrences shrouded in ambiguity I expected a
lot more.<br /><br />Yet, despite the lackluster effect of Melancholia, it is actually a
very fascinating film to watch. It has a superb visual quality and a
powerful soundtrack to go along with it. The film opens with a
beautiful symphony washed over a collection of slow motion frames that
don&#x27;t make a lot of sense at the time, but by the end of the film it
all makes sense. This haunting montage also throws in glorious shots of
space, in the vein of Tree of Life, ending with a moving outer space
shot of Melancholia crashing into Earth.<br /><br />After these wondrous 10-15 minutes we are introduced to all of our main
characters and the visual style turns into a hand-held shaky cam style
that exemplifies a kind of fly on the wall perspective. The style here
switches from slow and tense to jumpy and shaky, full of quick cuts and
sporadic edits which do indeed make for an interesting watch. But this
style is drawn out so long and so pointlessly at times that it doesn&#x27;t
stay interesting for the entire film, which clocks in unnecessarily at
over two hours.<br /><br />Melancholia is a memorable film with its own style that warrants
attention. Lars von Trier has definitely made the film he wanted to
make in his own special way, and I would say he did a fine job at
making an interesting film. I just feel like my expectations were not
fulfilled when this film, emotionally, didn&#x27;t strike me at all. It&#x27;s
slow, mundane, and even trivial at points. I didn&#x27;t get the sense that
there was a lot going on here, even though it seems like there should
have been. Melancholia is a good film, but nothing incredible.
