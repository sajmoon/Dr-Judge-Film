Melancholia is mesmerizing from beginning to end! It will leave viewers
reeling in their seats! <br /><br />You will find yourself captivated by the cinematography and your own
personal interpretation of the film, and you may find, as I did, that
interpretations vary. Simply put, this film floored Me and haunts Me, a
film rarely does that. <br /><br />It is the best I&#x27;ve seen yet from Lars Von Trier, it&#x27;s more than a
movie, it&#x27;s a brilliant work of art. The hopes, fragility,
vulnerability and isolation of a person within mankind is explored here
in vivid imagery and empathy. Again, the visual aspects are STUNNING!
The acting is superbly perfect, I can&#x27;t make complaint.<br /><br />The story and direction is wonderful too. Not a love story nor quite a
&#x22;doomsday&#x22; action flick, it&#x27;s something else entirely. It&#x27;s a provoking
drama / psychological thriller as somber as the title implies. <br /><br />It begins a bit slow, but the threat and drama increases. The
characters are well developed, and do precisely what they&#x27;re there to
do...make you speculate and wonder more. This is one film you will NOT
want to miss! Most amazing film I&#x27;ve seen in years!
