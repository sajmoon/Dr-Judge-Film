If you are looking for an SF or chick flick - look elsewhere. This will
just be a waste of time and money.<br /><br />This is Donnie Darko taken to the extreme. In that film, you could get
SF view on things or a realistic psychological view of it to get your
mind around the weird elements.<br /><br />Not so for this film. It&#x27;s an allegory. Planets colliding, end of the
world, nowhere to hide, hope and hopelessness, no one to protect, no
one to protect you, nothing that can be done but wait for the end...<br /><br />That&#x27;s melancholia - that mind-numbing depth of despair that Lars von
Trier is describing though the viewpoint of two sisters.<br /><br />The two parts are distorted slices of the same multi-dimensional
reality. There are many subtle details that tie together both. And more
than a little heavy-handedness - as if von Trier doesn&#x27;t trust his
audience.<br /><br />But it&#x27;s not just the cleverness that makes it worth watching -
otherwise it would be a bad Lynch film. There is genuine human emotion
in the interactions. Each brings out a different element of
melancholia. We can not help but watch fascinated and helpless as the
disaster slowly evolves to its inevitable conclusions.<br /><br />So sad yet so beautiful...
