Danish screenwriter and director Lars Von Trier&#x27;s eleventh feature film
which he wrote the screenplay for was produced by Louise Vesth and Meta
Louise Foldager and was shot on location at Tjol&#xF6;holms Castle and
Trollh&#xE4;ttan in Sweden. It tells the story about Justine, a young woman
who is about to get married at her sister Claire and her brother in-law
John&#x27;s mansion, where Claire and her husband has prepared a grand
wedding party for her and her soon to be husband Michael. Justine and
Michael arrives seemingly happy to the extravagant wedding where they
are welcomed by their family members, but as the evening unfolds the
bride&#x27;s mood seems to be changing and she appears to be bothered by
something. <br /><br />This prominently auditive and visual fictional story about the strained
relationship between two very opposite sisters and their different way
of reacting when the possibility of the end of the world presents
itself as a planet called &#x22;Melancholia&#x22;, is a dark, well-paced and
strangely romantic internal psychological drama which is strengthened
by Lars Von Trier&#x27;s stringent narrative structure and engaging
directing. Though still influenced by Andrey Tarkovsky (1932-1986) and
Ingmar Bergman (1918-2007), still expressing himself through female
characters and still focusing on the same themes as in many of his
previous films, this international co-production between Denmark,
France, Italy, Germany and Sweden is one of Lars Von Trier&#x27;s most
low-keyed films. The multilateral and foreboding atmosphere in this
dream-like and austere examination of the human mind, is reinforced by
the significant main theme, the prelude to German composer Richard
Wagner&#x27;s opera &#x22;Tristan und Isolde&#x22;, which adds another interesting
aspect to this unconventional visionary fable.<br /><br />This Gothic countryside character drama where Lars Von Trier creates
versatile portraits of Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s face, is aesthetically
photographed by Danish cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro, contains
some stellar images shot in ultra slow-motion and some poignant scenes
between Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kirsten Dunst which is brilliantly
acted. While starting of as a somewhat lavish character-driven family
drama about the initiation of a happy marriage, this artful piece of
modern cinema, with an excellent supporting cast, evolves into an
isolated psychological thriller and a dialog-driven chamber piece.
American actress Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s varied, introspective and understated
acting performance in a complicated role as the ethereal being Justine,
sustains the mystery in this cryptic film about the nature of fear
which gained, among several other awards, the award for best film, best
production design and best cinematography at the European Film Awards
in 2011, the NSCF Award for best film and best actress Kirsten Dunst at
the National Society of Film Critics Awards in 2012 and best actress
Kirsten Dunst at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011.
