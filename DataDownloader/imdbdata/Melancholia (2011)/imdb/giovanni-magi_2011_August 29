How could you tolerate that ridiculous camera movement? I am a TV
producer and I sometimes use the camera on hand to give some effect.
But in the final cut, my swinging effect doesn&#x27;t last more than 4
seconds. Here lasts more than two hours! I understand the purpose of
instilling anguish in the spectator, but this is a very poor trick. I
literally felt sick wanting to endure to the end, unlike other people
who have left the cinema in advance. I admit that the script may have
some interesting cues, although I found rather banal and obvious
certain combinations between astronomy and psychology. The acting is
good (thanks, actors!) but everything is ruined. I prefer directors who
talk to my brain, not to my guts.
