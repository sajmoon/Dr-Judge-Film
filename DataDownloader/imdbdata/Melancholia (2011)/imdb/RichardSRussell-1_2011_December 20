Melancholia (2:15, R) &#x97; other: drama, 3rd string, original, OSIT cynics<br /><br />Hamlet is known as &#x22;the melancholy Dane&#x22;, but Danish director Lars von
Trier seems to be bucking for the job with his latest film,
Melancholia, starring Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg as Justine
and Claire, a pair of sisters who don&#x27;t look even a little bit alike
but who share a propensity for gloom, despair, and depression.<br /><br />Casual moviegoers can be excused for confusing this film with the
earlier 2011 release Another Planet, as the 2 of them share the same
gimmick: Thru a grotesquely improbable flouting of orbital mechanics,
Earth is about to have a planetary rendezvous with another world-sized
object. Now &#x22;rendezvous&#x22; sounds cozy, maybe even a little racy, but
this is nothing to be casual about, as writers from Edwin Balmer to
Immanuel Velikovsky will attest.<br /><br />Nonetheless, both movies treat the imminent celestial osculation as
very much secondary to the foreground plot, the emotional turmoil of
the heroines. For all they know, it&#x27;s TEOTWAWKI, but it&#x27;s treated like
the background chatter at a cocktail party while the protagonists
discuss their love lives in the foreground. Really, you sort of wonder
what the point is of hauling in such a monumental event, only to
largely ignore it. Are the filmmakers saying that we shouldn&#x27;t take
their work seriously? Or is it the flip side of Casablanca, where Rick
claims that &#x22;the problems of three little people don&#x27;t amount to a hill
of beans in this crazy world&#x22;; maybe the point is that human concerns
are the only things that matter. Whatever the intent, I found it
distracting and, as I said above, gimmicky. Certainly you should not go
to this movie expecting to see a science-fiction picture.<br /><br />The film is divided into 2 parts, the 1st focusing on brand-new bride
Justine and the 2nd, apparently occurring some months later, on Claire.
It takes place entirely in and around a palatial country estate,
complete with a like-new (hardly ever used) 18-hole golf course, owned
by Claire&#x27;s filthy-rich husband John (an effective Kiefer Sutherland,
whom I never, not once, expected to see drag someone off to the garage
for a little conversation with the tire iron).<br /><br />John and Claire have agreed to host the wedding reception for Justine
(and pay for it, as John keeps reminding her), and it&#x27;s the social
event from hell. Who ARE all those people dancing and milling around in
the background? Justine and her bumbly groom Michael (Alexander
Skarsg&#xE5;rd) appear to know none of them, except the harridans,
scalawags, jerks, and doofi they&#x27;re immediately related to. It&#x27;s a
festival of impoliteness, condescension, lack of consideration, and
other socially appalling behavior from wall to wall. Justine tries to
keep up a fake smiley front, but Claire keeps nagging her that she
can&#x27;t let herself go, a dark hint that letting go is something Justine
has had a lot of practice at. Well, with THOSE parents and THAT boss,
small wonder! Eventually everything implodes, not with smash bash crash
bang but with soggy deflation.<br /><br />Almost nothing is made of the approach of the planet Melancholia in
Justine&#x27;s half of the movie, but it looms progressively larger, both
literally and figuratively, in Part 2, as Justine, husbandless,
jobless, and hopeless, returns to the estate to vegetate in a fetal
position while the focus shifts to Claire, trying to cope but not very
adeptly. She frets not only over her helpless, dysfunctional sister but
also over the war surrogate that literally hangs over her head, despite
John&#x27;s cheerful reassurances that the scientists have figured
everything out, and it&#x27;s all going to be OK. He seems sincere, but all
the while he&#x27;s being confident and comforting, the sound track is
moaning a steady, bone-deep low-level rumble reminiscent of an
avalanche half a mountain away.<br /><br />There&#x27;s weird, inexplicable imagery here. Among the opening
super-slo-mo vignettes is one of Justine raising her arms with Saint
Elmo&#x27;s fire sparking up from her fingertips, a scene which had nothing
to do with the rest of the film. Why, exactly, does the horse refuse to
cross the bridge? Who knows? Why does Antares, the bright red star at
the center of Scorpio, appear during the daylight in Part 1 and never
get noticed or mentioned again? Beats me.<br /><br />The film goes on for quite a long while, but not much happens. There&#x27;s
maybe 60-70 minutes worth of dialog, most of it blandly mundane,
grudgingly parceled out over the 2:15 runtime.<br /><br />It&#x27;s a film for cynics, and the cynic in me thinks that maybe the whole
enterprise was pitched to the financiers (TWENTY!! production companies
listed) to cover an elaborate plot by Von Trier to get Kirsten Dunst to
take her clothes off. If so, mission accomplished. And thanks for
sharing.<br /><br />I&#x27;ll give it one thing. Alfred Hitchcock said that, if you&#x27;re going to
call attention to a cannon at the outset, you&#x27;d better show it going
off in the 3rd act. Melancholia does that. It&#x27;s just that, by the TIME
it does, you no longer care whom the cannon is pointed at, or whether
anybody&#x27;s bothered to point it at all.<br /><br />Pointless. Get it?
