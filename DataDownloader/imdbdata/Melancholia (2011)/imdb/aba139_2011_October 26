This was the best anti-depressant I have ever experienced.<br /><br />If you want to see, feel and experience how much depression can be
energy consuming and destructive, especially when it is a depression at
the edge of insanity - than watch this movie. (Energy consuming: E.g.
during the second part it was extremely difficult for me not to fall
asleep.)<br /><br />I have problems with depression myself from time to time. And this film
showed me in an incomparably impressive way how much depression is my
enemy and not my friend, because it destroys.<br /><br />I had a very bad night after watching this film - and the really good
it did me was, that I decided, NO: I won&#x27;t worship a person who is very
much narcissistic, egocentric and it seems to me more insane than sane.
I am sad about a society that worships people like Lars von Trier
(don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t despise him). And I understand maybe in a
deeper way as before, that depression can be extremely destructive and
that I want to fight it or help myself out of it and don&#x27;t want to
worship or romanticise the destructive side of it (I think I
romanticised it sometimes too). Lars von Trier himself explained in an
interview, that this film is also romantic - he chose a romantic piece
of music to give it the romantic touch.<br /><br />I can understand why Lars von Trier understands Hitler, because I think
he understands how much Hitler was insane and egomaniac. And to give
insane people power is the most destructive thing you can do.<br /><br />In my opinion people like Lars von Trier should get treatment as much
as possible and better not get the opportunity to earn a lot of
attention and money out of the insane side of his personality.<br /><br />I would very much have appreciated that all the money and time that is
lost for this film was invested in finding more ways out of depression
or anything that is destructive in this world. You can call me
idealistic - but you can also call me pragmatic.<br /><br />I like that Lars von Trier said in an interview, that he feels guilty
doing melancholia. Guilt seems to be in place: as a viewer I felt kind
of used - he wanted to treat himself with this film and the film gave
me a bad feeling and a very bad night after watching it. Maybe I felt a
little bit like with my mother, she want&#x27;s me to &#x22;worship&#x22; her
narcissistic and destructive behaviour too (the difference is that she
doesn&#x27;t realise it and doesn&#x27;t feel guilty).<br /><br />I am giving this film 2 stars: one for awful and the other for the fact
that this film made me realise in a very strange but intensive way that
I myself will do what I can to find positive ways to overcome the
destructive and that I don&#x27;t approve of giving a narcissistic and
insane mind your attention and call it&#x27;s product a masterpiece.<br /><br />The fact, that I have learned my lesson, would never make me recommend
to watch this film, although there are some minutes worth while
watching. I suppose you can find these scenes at youtube (the worth
while watching prologue is on - but please don&#x27;t jump at conclusions if
you like it, the movie is much different).
