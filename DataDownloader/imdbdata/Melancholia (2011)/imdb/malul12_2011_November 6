As been said in many reviews before me it blew my mind.Astonishing!
Five couples left the movie in Dublin during this movie,i guess those
people are the ones writing the bad reviews around here :)<br /><br />The helpness is the strength throughout this movie,it never really gets
too joyful or happy but instead it scales down to pure soul.<br /><br />So here are some thoughts to you want to see something different;<br /><br />1.Do you and your partner want a love story,choose something else. 2.Do
you love Hollywood movies,choose Independence Day.<br /><br />Otherwise,this is the kind of movie that just after seeing it you
really can&#x27;t put your finger on it.The next day you really appreciated
it.<br /><br />2 days later you realize you have been watching those rare one that
just like a strong memory lasts with you until you go old and start to
forget things.I love to forget this one and see it again for the first
time,remarkable.
