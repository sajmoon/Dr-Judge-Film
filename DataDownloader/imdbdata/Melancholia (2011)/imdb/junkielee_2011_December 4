2011_December 4 
A night cinema experience is long overdue for me (21:15-23:30),
although it is not even midnight yet, nothing should be acted like a
storm in a teacup. <br /><br />The first thing I must declare is that hand-held camera really frets me
over during this film, I may be able to enjoy it on a home-setting DVD
environment (BREAKING THE WAVES 1996), but on the big screen of a
multiplex, it was disturbingly wobbly for me especially the wedding
banquet sequences in the first part called Justine. So in spite of its
stupefying slow-motion prologue, several quite visually awesome shots
(static, of course), and Charlotte Gainsburg and Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s subtle
while fabulous acting (btw, I put Charlotte over Kirsten, all other
supporting characters are barely cameos omitting Kiefer Sutherland, a
sullen wallflower), I only give a 6 out 10 in my rating. <br /><br />Then after two days of rumination (a spontaneous reaction and I have no
reason to explain why), what strikes me is the film has evolved into a
slow burn and been growing on me, and due to the fact that I possess a
predilection for pessimism, I just sense a more interlacing allusion of
the film (with my personal life), which effectively showcases an
unaware self- assurance in me, doomsdays may or may not come, the
hegemony of one&#x27;s own substantiality somehow is always reined by one&#x27;s
own willpower (although the nude scene of Justine basking under the
Melancholia-light is just a metaphorically trite stunt, even Lars
cannot resist to lay out some eye-candies to meet his audience&#x27;s eyes).
Nevertheless now I rate this film a sturdy 8 out of 10. <br /><br />PS: Today&#x27;s headline is MELANCHOLIA is winning big at this year&#x27;s
European Film Award (3 awards including BEST FEATURE FILM over the
red-hot THE ARTIST), so what can I say? controversy is never outmoded,
it could be arguably the best film of the year (if no one ever memorize
the persona-non-grata upset in Cannes earlier this year).
