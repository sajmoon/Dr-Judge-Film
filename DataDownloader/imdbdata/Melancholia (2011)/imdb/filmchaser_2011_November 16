Has anyone but me noticed that nobody bothered to cast two actresses
that were believable as &#x22;sisters?&#x22; That seems really important since
the entire film is centered around their relationship. Yet, one is
blond with an American accent, and the other dark with a British
accent, from two parents with British accents...so, in the first
instance, it was hard to even believe the characters who carried the
entire film. Secondly, this movie had the effect of making me feel like
I was supposed to buy in to under-developed characters, then believe
that the character played by Kirsten Dunst named &#x22;Justine&#x22; was plagued
by depression in the midst of all this sumptuous grandiosity that
surrounded her: a castle, with an 18-hold golf course, and an
indulgent, hovering sister married to a man who didn&#x27;t mind forking
over thousands of dollars to make Justine &#x22;happy,&#x22; as everyone in the
movie apparently was trying to do. I&#x27;m pretty forgiving in my
criticisms of a person&#x27;s art, but I found nothing about the plot of
this movie believable and felt confused and irritated throughout the
film. Admittedly, the photography was breath-taking, and in fact, the
best part of the film. But in a time when people are dealing with
feeding themselves because of economic downturn, it&#x27;s very hard to
sympathize with a character who comes across as self-indulgent,
self-absorbed, cruel to animals, and generally hateful to everyone
around her while enjoying the luxury of being cared for by everyone
around her. Did we have to &#x22;beat a horse&#x22; to get the point of Justine&#x27;s
depression? I think the movie would have been more interesting if
everyone had just let Justine sleep. I&#x27;m still wondering why the little
boy Leo called Justine &#x22;Auntie Steelbreaker&#x22; or was it &#x22;Deal breaker?&#x22;
who knows? Why bother to develop characters when the point is to
exhaust your audience by dragging them into your auto-biographical
nightmare, which is beautiful, yet ugly; somber yet comedic; ironic yet
fatalistic; American yet British/Swedish, Blond yet Brunette. I may
never watch another Swedish film. What a waste of talent.
