It doesn&#x27;t matter if you like Director Lars Von Trier or not , there is
no doubting that he&#x27;s films produce plenty of talking points. His last
movie , Antichrist was beautiful at times yet horrific in others and i
think i liked it!<br /><br />Melancholia is tries to hit the heights of Antichrist but never gets
close.<br /><br />The film is in two chapters.The first revolves around a wedding and a
bride, played by Kirsten Dunst who seems to be oblivious of the
importance of her big day and the second half revolves around the
planet Melancholia which is heading for Earth and the destruction of
the planet. <br /><br />While i found this film watchable i never really understood what Von
Trier was trying to do.<br /><br />I have seen it described as a disaster movie and maybe that was said as
a critical statement?! Basically it&#x27;s about people acting strangely
without any real explanation.<br /><br />I cant recommend this film to anyone as it&#x27;s just too odd.
