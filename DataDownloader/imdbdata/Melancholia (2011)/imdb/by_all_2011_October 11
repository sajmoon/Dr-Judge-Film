This review is especially for those who are prone to depression and, of
course, melancholia. After seeing Antichrist just two weeks ago, I must
admit I was not ready to see another von Trier movie since his movies
are very powerful and they stay with me for a very, very long time. But
I was very curios at the same time. Even though I sometimes wish I
hadn&#x27;t watched the uncut version, Antichrist had the best
cinematography I have ever seen and I wanted to see more of it. Besides
the thrilling story, stop motion scenes and those colors just amazed me
and I also love the way he shoots, not like a shaky camera as some say,
but like wondering eyes, and anyway, I got what I wanted. And more.<br /><br />With the prologue, von Trier began his magic and during those two
hours, I did not blink for a second. I was completely in the story,
having lost the track of time/space, whatever. At the wedding we meet
several characters, important for revealing more of the two sisters.
But in the end, we see only couple of them facing with death.<br /><br />It is, I can say, the only movie which made me feel sorry for myself
because of the character I sympathized with. When the movie ended and
the lights were back on, I was in no way ready to move. I had
melancholia all over. I still cannot say if I was feeling a relief or
emptiness. Be careful of timing, but certainly see it. No regrets
