Let me just start by saying do not watch this film if you are tired you
need to stay awake and watch it, it might numb your ass but it is so
worth it. From the very start of this film i was hooked i wanted to
know more about each of the characters as soon as they appeared on the
screen and for some that happened and others not so much but you were
not left looking at empty shells of characters that are just brought in
to look pretty they are really tangible people that make you want to
know them and you are happy for the little glimpse that you are given
into each of there lives (and that is just the first part)<br /><br />The second part is just as gripping it is both subtle and beautiful in
ways which are really hard to describe and with a final moment that has
stuck with me a the front of my brain ever since i left the cinema. <br /><br />this film is not for everyone and normally i would give it a lower
rating for just that reason but not in this case i feel that even if
you watch this film and you hate it you life will be better for just
seeing it. please watch it, please please please!
