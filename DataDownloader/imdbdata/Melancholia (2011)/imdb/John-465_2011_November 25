Melancholia is easily the worst movie I have ever spent money to see,
or at least the first hour is, I can&#x27;t comment on the remainder because
I did something I have not done in over 25 years, I walked out of the
theater before the movie was over. This turkey gives us a &#x22;plot&#x22; that
is pretentious amateurish ridiculous and dull, characters with vapid
dialog who emote with LONG vacant stares at the camera and try to
convince us (unsuccessfully) that their melancholia means they are deep
and not just self indulgent or have a chemical imbalance, and those
aren&#x27;t even the worst things about this movie.<br /><br />If Mr. von Trier can&#x27;t give us something interesting to think about he
could have at least presented something for us to look at without
making one seasick, but apparently Mr.von Trier got a new zoom lens for
his birthday and he was eager to try it out, so he zooms in, and then
he zooms out, and then he zooms in, and then he zooms out again, and
then he zooms way way way in and figures that would be the perfect time
for a swish pan, and all the time he&#x27;s playing with the zoom he&#x27;s
holding the camera as if fire ants were crawling up his pant legs and
he was trying to shake them off. And I&#x27;m not just talking about one bad
scene I&#x27;m talking about the entire first hour, perhaps the entire movie
but I wouldn&#x27;t know about that. Even Ed Wood knew more about how to
move a camera than Mr.von Trier, I&#x27;m serious, Plan Nine from Outer
Space showed more technical skill than Melancholia; so I would humbly
suggest that before Mr.von Trier makes another home movie he sell his
zoom lens and use the money to buy a tripod.
