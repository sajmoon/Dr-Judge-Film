In just a few words, WHAT A WASTE OF TIME watching this movie! Over 7
stars for what? The story takes you &#x22;so&#x22; many places or situation, but
at the end, you feel you ended up nowhere. The story flow is
ridiculously executed, at times, I kept saying to myself during the
screening, who in hell would put such moronic ideas together and for
what purpose. The storyline is too fragmented and lame. This is by far
one of the worse movies I have EVER seen. DO NOT WATCH THIS LAME and
DUMB story, if you want to keep some level of sanity about your movie
experiences. If there was a (0) rating, it would probably describe what
this movie deserved! PURE TRASH but as usual, some people called ART.
What a JOKE!
