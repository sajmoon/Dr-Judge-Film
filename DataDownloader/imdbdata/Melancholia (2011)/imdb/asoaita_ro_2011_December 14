Excellent movie, very well done, with comic scenes along with tragic
scenes. I think the planet collision is a metaphoric expression of the
depression/anxiety hit. In my opinion, this movie, is not as disturbing
as Breaking the Waves or Dancing in the dark but it says a lot about
how empty the life may be. It is a movie similar with Zentropa,
although the SF part is different. Impressing subtle criticism of the
suburban life, with the emptiness of the golf terrain, with how useless
the pick-up truck can be, etc. Also, there is a contradiction between
the over confidence in scientists optimism, and the actual facts, which
lead the main man figure to leave this world when his family needed him
most.
