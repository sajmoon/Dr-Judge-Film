I&#x27;ve had a chance to watch Melancholia recently and I&#x27;m still
impressed. Movie doesn&#x27;t give you a chance you to forget it. There&#x27;s no
need to decode a movie concept &#x96; it&#x27;s simple, brutal and very
disturbing although it goes slowly. Kirsten Danst plays her role great,
as well as others do &#x96; amazingly alive and natural and thanks to Lars
Von Trier &#x96; he created a great movie that smashes you while you are
watching it. Also I was blown away by great music, picturesque shots
and movie techniques in general &#x96; everything works great together and
hypnotizes your brain in a ruthless way. I gave 9 not 10 of 10 just for
a last 10 minutes of the movie which I assume could be more pushy and
CGIed (and, probably, more mass-marketed and trivial - so i missed
these CGI petards stuff a little). Really recommend to spend your time
and money &#x96; movie&#x27;s worth it.
