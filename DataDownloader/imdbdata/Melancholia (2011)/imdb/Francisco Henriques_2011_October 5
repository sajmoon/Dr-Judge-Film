I rented this movie because I&#x27;ve read so many good reviews about it,
and honestly, all those awesome reviews, I don&#x27;t know. Either these
people are payed to leave a nice tip, or they felt asleep meanwhile and
dreamed of something else, reviewing the nice dream they had, because,
seriously, you can&#x27;t say this movie was good. It was anywhere near as
good, not even &#x22;it was alright&#x22;, it just sucked. It&#x27;s slow passed, two
complete distinct stories, which don&#x27;t tie that good together, and...
come one, seriously? 7.8? It doesn&#x27;t deserve a 7.8, it doesn&#x27;t deserve
a 2, left alone a 5.<br /><br />It&#x27;s slow passed, boring, acting was OK, but what&#x27;s to act about it.
There&#x27;s not much to act really. I&#x27;ve read some nice reviews to watch
other movies which I actually enjoyed, but this one, please, spend your
money elsewhere. Buy a hot dog, you will like it more and at least
you&#x27;ll get it. And now I&#x27;m depressed :(
