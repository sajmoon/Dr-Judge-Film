***No Spoilers*** Being a huge fan of Lars Von Trier&#x27;s work I was
highly anticipating this film. It was released in cinemas on 29 May
2011 in the Czech Republic on 12 screens as well as other locations
like Denmark, Finland and Italy. It soon will come to theaters in the
US. Luckily we live in the time that we do and this movie can be
streamed before its US theatrical release. I took advantage of this and
greatly enjoyed watching this film from the comfort of my own home.<br /><br />I loved Antichrist. In my opinion it is Trier&#x27;s best work. It was a
very disturbing film, yet it had a very strong message with hidden
meanings and was all around a beautiful poetic piece of work.<br /><br />Melancholia also is a beautiful film, though I believe I expected more.
Antichrist is very deep and constantly keeps you on the edge of your
seat because so much is happening and you must decipher the message and
meaning of the film. Melancholia is very slow and drawn out. Lars Von
Trier did this due to the high anticipation of what will happen, and if
it will happen. Trier used the characters anxiety and built upon that
and made the viewer feel that anxiety too. Just like Antichrist,
Melancholia is a feeling. Your not just watching a movie, eating
popcorn and drinking a pop, you are feeling this film.<br /><br />Just a quick summary for those who don&#x27;t know, Melancholia is a planet
which is seemingly coming closer to Earth. This phenomenon happens when
Justine (Kirsten Dunst) has just been married to Michael (Alexander
Skarsg&#xE5;rd). Justine&#x27;s sister, Clair (Charlotte Gainsbourg), her husband
John (Kiefer Sutherland), and Justine and Clair&#x27;s mother Gaby
(Charlotte Rampling) greatly put pressure on Justine to have this
perfect wedding. Justine is not very interested in the wedding
reception and seems to come in and out of reality. She is not the type
of person to have such a large wedding because she doesn&#x27;t care. She is
a wild girl who seems to have been roped into marrying Michael and
marrying into this new family which she is nothing like. There is a lot
of drama in this film and for the first half, Melancholia is a back
story which the viewer patiently waits for.<br /><br />The cast is amazing and works well together. I really enjoyed Kiefer
Sutherlands character. Kirsten Dunst did an amazing job, however her
performance seems unbalanced at times, though the character she is
playing is unbalanced.<br /><br />After viewing this film I was left speechless due to the raw power of
the cast and the images of the film itself. However it made me feel
very uneasy, disturbed and very anxious. I immediately thought, &#x22;I
never want to watch that again&#x22;. Yet I cannot get it out of my mind and
I watched it again later that night. This movie will deeply leave an
impression on you.
