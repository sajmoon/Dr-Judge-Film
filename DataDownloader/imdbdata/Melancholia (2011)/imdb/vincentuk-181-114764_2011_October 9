What a totally garbage movie, made by the same type of kids who made
blair witch, i see no sense what so ever in filming every scene with a
hand held camera, if i want to get dizzy i will go to the fair &#x26; go on
the roller-coaster, i don&#x27;t want to get dizzy watching a so called
film. on top of all this he is zooming in a out all the time, &#x26;
shooting from multiple angles in seconds for every mundane scene, the
director is not doing it for effect, it just seems his attention span
lasts for 1 second then he has to move the camera or focus in and out
or shoot from another ridiculous camera angle, i was under the
impression families make these type of films with a shaky camcorder no
direction everyone in a free for all, somehow its called art now when a
talentless director does it, does he know what century we are in, if i
like this type of movie i would watch charlie chaplain, i don&#x27;t want to
pay &#xA3;10 to watch a turkey like this, the script? well imagine you are
high as a kite on drugs then you might just comprehend what total
rubbish it is, it reminds me of watching the parts of a film that are
edited out in other films &#x26; shown on the DVD extra&#x27;s the parts that
just don&#x27;t work, except in this film nothing works, i watched this film
on the strength of the reviews here, were we watching the same film? i
see no sense what so ever in paying &#xA3;10 for a film ticket to have a 1
year old just starting to walk trying to hold a camcorder steady &#x26;
start filming mam &#x26; dad, thats it in a nutshell a baby or a drunken
camerman with a camcorder, with a director writing the script on
postage stamps, and actors visibly waiting for there cue, &#x26; so many
pregnant pauses that add up to 60 minutes right there.
