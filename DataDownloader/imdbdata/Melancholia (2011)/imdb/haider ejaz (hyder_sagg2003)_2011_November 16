The earth comes to it end......Sounds haunting? yes it sure does. They
have made films like this before how the earth will end. Different
religions have different beliefs but they have the doomsday in common.<br /><br />Films have been made before and some of them were pretty decent,
Melancholia 2011 is just like them with some added slow motion
prolonged scenes and beautiful visuals.<br /><br />Melancholia&#x27;s best part is its direction. Even the story told is not
very good, the way its translated on screen is neat. The length of the
movie is more than 2 hours in which at least 30 minutes of the movie
are EXCESSIVE. Performances are decent and the plot looks interesting
and haunting. I am neither disappointed by it by any means nor
impressed. But the whole impact of the movie is positive.<br /><br />8/10. Classic!
