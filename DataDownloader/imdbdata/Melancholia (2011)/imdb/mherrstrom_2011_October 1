As a fan of Von Trier after movies as Breaking The Waves and the
Kingdome series his work has not been without let downs, as the
supremely boring Dogville and Bjorks all too good, impossible to like
-personna in Dancer In The Dark.<br /><br />Melancholia however is not a let down. It is more of a psyche
penetrating state of daydream. It&#x27;s Von Trier at his best. When he
manages to put his understanding of psychology into images and actors
he is a true filmmaker. In Melancholia all this comes across in an even
pace that doesn&#x27;t halt or ring bad at a single note. Not all is
understandable in logical terms, but very so in emotional or perhaps
archetypal ones. Kirsten Dunst is fantastic in the way that her
simplistic, minimalistic way of acting gives the role limitless depth
and I find myself constantly wanting to know more about the person she
portrays.<br /><br />In these days and times the theme itself is straight at the center, the
end of the world must be a theme awakened in everybody&#x27;s mind, at least
the clever rightfully scared ones...
