Why do we watch movies? Read books? Encounter art? For entertainment?
Escape? Truth? Yet it always misses the mark. Film is never a depiction
of the world as it is. Art is always-already representation, a farce.
To wish for more will always leaves us wanting. A filmmaker (artist)
who appreciates the futility of striving for realism has the power to
touch on the &#x22;real&#x22; subjects that give substance and meaning, the
in-between relations - shared but never sufficient to bridge the
infinitesimally enormous chasms that connect us.<br /><br />The cinematic tools (stilted acting, otherworldly starkness,
discontinuities - so loathed by a number of critics) function as
constant reminders that &#x22;this is only a movie&#x22;. With &#x22;Antichrist&#x22; and
&#x22;Melancholia&#x22;, Von Trier has honed these tools to the point of being
able to offer both a believability to the narrative while always
hinting at a tinge of dissonance - the kind that lingers in the face of
impending doom.<br /><br />The joy of this film (and others by Von Trier) is the vitality and
force given to the incommensurable fact that we are all hopelessly
alone, never understood, and communication (representation) premised on
an attempt to overcome these failures is pointless. Lars Von Trier is a
necessary voice in his commitment to the affirmation inherent in these
pronouncements. Huddled in the &#x22;magic cave&#x22; moments before
annihilation, we are presented with three choices (possibilities):
naivet&#xE9;, existential resolve, and anxious fear. We are compelled to ask
the question, how else to respond to the inevitability of death? <br /><br />The clarity of Von Trier&#x27;s is a muddled one, open to accusations of
pretense. Profundity is rarely spelled out and is always lacking, but
what isn&#x27;t? Art that suggests otherwise is the real pretender.
