Melancholia is an imperfect film. And as it&#x27;s the case with most
masterpieces they are perfect in their imperfection. I believe that a
great work of art is one that transcends, one that defies rules, one
that is both modern and conservative in it&#x27;s approach. Melancholia is
one of those.<br /><br />What separates the greatest films from the good or the average is that
when they tackle themes like depression, cosmic influences, death,
hope, they manage to take the viewer to the extremes just like a shrink
would probably make you face your worst fears before you can feel
liberated.Most films do only the first part, lacking the cathartic feel
at the end. But the again that is the most difficult thing to achieve.
In Psychology, doctors have techniques. In Art though, this is not an
easy task. As an artist not only do you need to find the right tone,
but also to find the rhythm of your narrative and that develops through
work and work and work. And I think this is where most artists fail.
They become too preoccupied with their obsession, their fears, and fail
to give it a value when they translate it into art. Sometimes you need
to distance yourself from things to get a better view. For many years I
thought Von trier was in the latter category, too self indulgent,
having great ideas, great themes, and yet not getting the technique
right. In Melancholia he is bang on.<br /><br />And even if the first half is slightly over the place and not in the
same category with second chapter, I would still rate this film a 10
because sometimes these things are not important. When you see someone
has a heart, you forgive that person all their clumsiness. I thought
for long if the first part, the wedding, was necessary. Probably not,
but I am not the director of this film. However, what I do think that
was needed, was the introduction of Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s character outside
the larger context presented in the second chapter. Her performance is
one of the best of 2011. And even if the first chapter is uneven,
without it, her understated performance in the second part of the film
would never pack a punch as it does now. <br /><br />This film reminds me a lot of Bergman&#x27;s &#x27;Cries and Whispers&#x27; or
Tarkovsky&#x27;s Stalker which employ the same techniques as this one. If
you like this one, check Bergman&#x27;s and Tarkovsky&#x27;s films too. Also
check my list &#x27;My favorite movies, recommend others&#x27; for other films in
the same vein.<br /><br />Other films I enjoyed in 2011 are: The Tree of Life, The Skin I live
In, Certified Copy and Poupoupidou.
