Yesterday I had the chance to see Melancholia. I was a bit anxious
given the mixed reception here (either euphoric or very negative).<br /><br />It seems the media are talking more about the
disaster-press-conference-from-hell Lars gave in Cannes. Which is a
shame.<br /><br />Like always, Lars von Trier does not want to appeal to the general
public, but in stead wants to present the viewer something unique and
honest.<br /><br />It was influenced by his own &#x22;melancholia&#x22;, of which he suffered when
working on this project.<br /><br />I, for one saw solid acting and great directing from a person who
carefully observes and understands human interaction. For me it works.<br /><br />This movie is by no means perfect but it was thought provoking, and
heart touching and that&#x27;s exactly what a decent movie should try to
achieve. <br /><br />Thank you for reading my opinion.
