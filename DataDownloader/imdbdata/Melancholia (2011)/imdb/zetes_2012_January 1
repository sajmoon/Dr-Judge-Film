2012_January 1 
Lars von Trier used to be one of my all-time favorite filmmakers. I
still quite value his early films like The Element of Crime and Europa.
His Dogma-esque films like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark I
have lost most interest in them (I haven&#x27;t seen either in over a
decade). His most recent films haven&#x27;t impressed me at all. His latest,
Melancholia, doesn&#x27;t impress me either. In fact, much like Antichrist,
I find it quite beautiful, but a little boring and entirely vapid.
Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg star as sisters. The first half
of the film concerns Dunst&#x27;s opulent but disastrous wedding. The second
half concerns Gainsbourg&#x27;s hysterical fear of a rogue planet, named
Melancholia (apparently the lead singer of the band Evanescence won a
contest or something), which is quickly approaching the Earth.
Gainsbourg&#x27;s husband (Kiefer Sutherland), a knowledgeable man, swears
the calculations show it won&#x27;t hit the Earth, but Gainsbourg isn&#x27;t so
sure. It&#x27;s weird that I watched this the day after I saw another
semi-sci-fi film about an approaching planet, Another Earth. Much like
Another Earth, Melancholia pretty much ignores science in favor of
using the premise as a metaphor. The thing is, I can understand the
metaphor in Another Earth. In Melancholia, I don&#x27;t really get what Lars
von Trier is going for. My first impression, though, is that his point
is bitches be all crazy. That is, after all, his point in every one of
his films since Breaking the Waves. It may sound like I hated it. I
didn&#x27;t. The only film I&#x27;ve hated of his really was Epidemic.
Melancholia is quite gorgeous to look at, and it was rather hypnotic.
Perhaps a second viewing will elucidate the film more.
