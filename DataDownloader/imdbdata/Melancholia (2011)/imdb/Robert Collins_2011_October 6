Lars Von Trier, psychopath some say, others say genius, I personally am
in the genius bunch. I dint think there&#x27;s any other film maker working
today who is a daring as Lars, his subject matter is always striking to
the mind and a danger to the senses.<br /><br />Melancholia is in my opinion is his most mainstream film to date, I
also think it&#x27;s his most tame, but all in all it&#x27;s probably one of his
greatest achievements as a filmmaker. There&#x27;s slot of symbolism which
some may not get but if you kind of just let your mind go and go with
the story you are certainly in for a treat.<br /><br />The story is split in 2 parts, the first is from The view point of
Justine, expertly performed by the usually mediocre safe player Kirsten
Dunst, she certainly impressed me in this film. We follow her on her
wedding night as she falls deeper and deeper into a wave of depression,
watching the first part of this movie is so weird, you see that this
family are very strange and basically have zero love for each other.
The first half also introduces the meteor heading towards earth aptly
named Melancholia.<br /><br />The 2nd part of the film is when it amps up and really starts to become
a Lars Von Trier film, it is from the viewpoint of Claire, played to
perfection by the always amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg. In this half the
meteor has gotten closer to earth and Claire is very fastly becoming
terrified. The Justine character is a lot more interesting I think
because she shows a lot more emotion and fear about the oncoming doom.<br /><br />From beginning to end this movie is a masterpiece, the opening scene is
very reminiscent of the opening scene from Antichrist, the acting is
absolutely stellar, a lot if people are raving about Ms Dunst but Ms
Gainsbourg also deserves a mention, they are both mighty impressive,
the music is thrilling to the ears and the setting is gorgeous, all the
way through right up to the epic grand final scene I was entirely glued
to the screen, I didn&#x27;t want to miss a moment of it.<br /><br />A lot can be said about this movie but its hard to put into words,
every viewer will have an entirely different opinion of it, a lot will
be bad but that&#x27;s nothing new for a Lars Von Trier film, you either
love him or hate him.<br /><br />See it if you dare.
