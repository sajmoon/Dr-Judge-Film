Lars von Trier&#x27;s Melancholia is a stupendium. It is divided into two
parts: &#x27;Justine&#x27;, where the melancholic Kirsten Dunst fails to cut
through her cardboard existence at her own wedding reception; and
&#x27;Claire&#x27; told from the point of view of her sister, Charlotte
Gainsbourg, who has trouble dealing with the threat of a recently
discovered planet, Melancholia, that, in three days time, either
promises the greatest show on earth as a &#x27;fly by&#x27; or the end of this
pointless world as we know it by smacking bang into us. If Justine is
&#x27;depression&#x27;, Claire is her sibling syndrome of modern existence,
&#x27;anxiety&#x27;. While we identify easily with her growing panic, given the
circumstances, the more meaningful aspects of our lives are made to
seem just as empty in part one and we share Justine&#x27;s struggle to make
any sense out of the faceless guests, the interminable schedule of the
reception, her new husband. David Stratton hates the hand held camera,
but in this film it has two important purposes: first it makes us feel
Justine&#x27;s disassociation in part one as well as Claire&#x27;s growing panic
and all out terror in part two; secondly, it distracts us from becoming
immersed in the story of the film. Von Trier consistently reminds us
that this is a film and the characters are acting out an imagined
scenario, exploring concepts that are abstracted to a degree, which
saves the film from being a beautiful but ultimately silly disaster
movie. Is this an allegorical tale about how we are being obliterated
by our collective empty and anxious existences manifesting as a giant
planet crashing into earth? Or is it a genuine exploration of how a
mere human being can come to terms with the surety of his or her own
personal annihilation? It doesn&#x27;t really matter. Melancholia treads the
finer lines of meaning in a way that only film can do and that this
film does so well: through symbolic visual imagery. In the prelude, a
woman stands in mediation, surrender or exultation while dead birds
fall around her. A mother carrying her son struggles over a golf green,
sinking to her knees at each step as the ground ceases to support her:
someone&#x27;s nightmare, a premonition or their last memory on earth? A
black horse collapses in exquisite slow motion to the ground. Has it
been shot, drugged or is it simply sitting down? The film reel does not
play out to the end of each scenario and so von Trier keeps us in
suspended wonderment. Common day notions of space and time disintegrate
to a booming orchestral sound track that out Kubriks Kubrick as two
planets horribly, magnificently collide.
