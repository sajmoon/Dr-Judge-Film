this is one of the most pretentious and the most pointless movies i&#x27;ve
ever seen. i cannot help wondering if all the other reviewers given
such high ratings indeed have watched the same movie as i&#x27;m trying to
get a grip here.<br /><br />so the world was going to come to an end, and a wedding had panned out
due to the late and delay of the new couple riding a long limo that got
todrive to the deep countryside to have a grand wedding ceremony and
the limo simply couldn&#x27;t handle the curvy and narrow country road all
way to that remote mansion. my god, how cruel you two lousy families
that decided to hold a wedding ceremony in such deserted countryside?<br /><br />then the ceremony dragged out into the night, everybody felt tired and
still had to hahaha the jokes of the relatives&#x27; crap. then, there were
some mysterious sadness, loss, emotions that almost ruined the wedding
party. then the elder sister(?) also got some personal demons that got
to be dealt with during and after the wedding? <br /><br />then just because the rotation of several(?) planets in the solar
system that messed up the gravity so the earth was doomed right away
after that specific wedding. the sound track artificially gave out the
doomed earth, and everybody kept raised their head to watch the son,
the moon and the 3rd planet getting closer and closer and lined up....<br /><br />well, what can i say, dude. this movie recruited so many heavy wt. and
matured international actors, and they all effortlessly performed well
to dance to and with the stupid tune of this stupid screenplay. this
movie has forced us to watch their great performances instead of the
stupid scenario and the storyline. but at the same time, we also felt
their retardiness and awkwardness to carry on and carry through such
contrite, ridiculous and hollow plot. i just felt sorry for these
actors that they had to maintain their great performance by following a
ridiculous, hollow and especially illogic screenplay.<br /><br />am i talking about the same movie with same title? i am still wondering
and quite uncertain.
