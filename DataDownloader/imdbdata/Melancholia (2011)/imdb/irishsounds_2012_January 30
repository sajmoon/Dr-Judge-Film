2012_January 30 
All marks are for the images - especially at the beginning. The story
line however and I guess the quite excellent direction, built up a
level of great unease in me to a point I had to leave.<br /><br />So I guess I am not qualified to do a full review, as I only saw a
fraction of the film.<br /><br />In a way I am sorry to rate this film so low, because there are some
excellent elements to it. Not least of these are the cinematography,
the imagery, and the director&#x27;s ability to build, at least in me, a
very high level of anxiety, dread, and depression. This movie triggered
something from my deepest nightmares - something no horror movie I have
watched ever was able to do.<br /><br />The result of this quality craftsmanship however, was to send me
running, a result which I am sure the director would not have wished.<br /><br />A well crafted movie, which IMHO, would be best avoided by some people
like me - but not because of any actor, director, or editor failings -
simply because it produces some VERY unpleasant negative feelings.
