This is the epitome of a movie that you don&#x27;t go to watch to have a
good time with. It&#x27;s about the emotions of human nature and depression
that takes most of time during a wedding ceremony, and it&#x27;s a boring
party at that. Which is why it isn&#x27;t surprising why Justine played by
Kirsten Dunst isn&#x27;t enjoying the party that cost a fortune. There is
few artistic clich&#xE9; type of music to show how artsy the movie is. The
movie is basically almost about nothing and how the meaning of life is
nothing. Movies like &#x22;Drive&#x22; for example has proved artistic movies
don&#x27;t have to be boring. That isn&#x27;t the case for this, I really don&#x27;t
think Lars Von Trier is a genius like some critics claim, he might
think a bit different compared to average people but he isn&#x27;t a movie
genius. It is just shot in what the director thinks is artistic in his
perspective and moves very slow. The first hour of this movie is a
wedding ceremony and there is almost no plot, just people having a
boring wedding ceremony and the family arguing amongst each other. The
intro is the best part of this movie although that ain&#x27;t saying much
and it basically shows the end of the world and the rest of the movie
goes about showing how it got to that point with hardly any plot. And I
thought &#x22;Antichrist&#x22; was a boring movie, this movie is just so darn
dull I kept wanting it to just end. The only thing I give props on this
movie is how it makes the actors and actress ugly and not super
glamorous in a lot of movies they were in. Watching this movie was like
watching paint dry...Ouch I know. If this is a art film than it proves
that it really isn&#x27;t that difficult to direct a art film. I once saw a
cup of urine at a museum and it was there as art, everyone has there
own perception of art and this movie was like that cup of urine. Even
Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s boobs can&#x27;t make up for how dull this movie is, not
that I ever found that actress to be attractive or that good of a
actress. At least this time the director doesn&#x27;t try to be all
grotesque with violence and has a bunch of very sexual parts in there
while trying to push the limit to prove how artistic he is. Lars Von
Trier shows once again shows that he is a Nihilist and tries to show
that perspective on screen in the dullest way possible. It isn&#x27;t clear
with the characters emotions and the reason behind it, although there
is. Like how this movie is about life and how it&#x27;s meaningless as the
end of the world gets closer. And I am not ruining anything since it
shows the earth getting destroyed in the beginning scene. This movie is
like the them of the movie, no purpose. Well at least the acting is
pretty good especially from Charlotte Gainsbourg. You know how when
there is a very depressed individual in the group and ruins the mood,
that is how this movie felt like. There is recollection and meanings
behind the characters but you could careless about that with the
direction of it all. One thing I got that the director wanted to show
was the two opposites of the sisters, one having nothing to lose thus
she is a melancholic and the other having something to lose because she
is aware of who she is and is fine with that. Like human nature we all
long for something and that message of the movie was interesting, just
presented in a boring manner. Well I know I will never ever being
seeing this movie again.<br /><br />2.5/10
