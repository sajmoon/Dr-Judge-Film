After &#x22;Anitichrist&#x22; I had given up on Lars Von Triar but I was tempted
back after reading some articles on his new opus &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; I&#x27;m glad
I did. He is still the most maddening of filmmakers because his
chutzpah is larger and more up front than his talent, that means a
huge, monumental chutzpah. &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; has many things going for it:
the performances by the two female leads, Kirsten Duntst and Charlotte
Gainsburg are pure cinematic brilliance. The photography, superb with
some sound design worthy of superlative praise. Glimpses of John Hurt
and Charlotte Rampling are also a major plus but the script littered by
infantile dialog was a crashing blow. The film left me without appetite
or willingness to talk. The one thing that I have to confess, I may,
just may see it again one day.
