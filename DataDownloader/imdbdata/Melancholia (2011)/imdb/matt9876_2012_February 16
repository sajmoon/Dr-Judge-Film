A good preview encouraged my girlfriend to suggest we go along and see
this movie. However, knowing the director, she set the bar quite low in
terms of expectations.<br /><br />Von Trier limboed his way under that bar with clearance to spare.<br /><br />A bigger load of unmitigated narcissistic self indulgent w*** I have
never, ever seen. I like films that provoke the mind - this didn&#x27;t. The
fact that at the end the audience were giggling in a way that suggested
they couldn&#x27;t believe it was that bad, that they must have somehow
missed the point, said it all to me.<br /><br />Plot that made &#x22;Transformers&#x22; look like it was at the level of 2001
(Transformers being my previous &#x22;worst movie ever made&#x22; - but at least
I knew I was getting crud in advance there). Characters which made a
typical Adam Sandler &#x22;comedy&#x22; look like a masterpiece of creation. I
must say, I felt melancholic that I&#x27;d spent good money watching this
awful excuse for.... well whatever that was supposed to be.
