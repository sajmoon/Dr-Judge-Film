This film is about a woman&#x27;s wedding night, and the days after that
with her sister.<br /><br />The first seven minutes of &#x22;Melancholia&#x22; look very visually beautiful.
Even though scenes are presented in slow motion, they are aesthetically
appealing and very atmospheric. However, once the film proper starts,
it deteriorates quickly. We see Justine, the sister getting married,
being passive aggressive and in a permanently foul mood. Just why does
she act so antagonistically is not explained well. Justine is so
unlikable and irritating that I could not get into the film at all.<br /><br />The pace is so painfully slow, especially in the second half. The film
just gets more boring as it goes on. The ending climax is weak
emotionally and cinematically. Well, I have lost all interest in the
film by then anyway.
