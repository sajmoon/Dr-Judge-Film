Zalman King's Two Moon Junction, probably isn't as good as his 9 1/2 Weeks,
but the film does have quite a few love scenes that we wouldn't see in
today's films. Sherilyn Fenn stars as April who doesn't seem to like her new
fiance Chad (Martin Hewett). In an attempt to find what see wants, she goes
to a local carnival and falls for muscle bound carnival worker Perry
(Richard Tyson) and have the usual affair. The all star cast includes
Academy Award winners, Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and
Burl Ives (The Big Country), other well known cast members include Herve
Villichaize (TV's Fantasy Island), Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element),
Millie Perkins (Diary of Anne Frank), Juanita Moore (Academy Award nominee
for Imitation of Life) and Kristy McNicole (TV's Empty Nest). Not bad, but
could have been a little better for a sex film.
