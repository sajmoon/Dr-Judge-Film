What to say?
This movie fails to deliver a believable story, interesting characters and
good juicy sexy scenes. The only reason to rent this movie would be to
watch
an easy drama, that with the help of a reasonable plot will deliver some
exciting and intriguing sexual encounters. Unfortunately that's not what
happens.<br /><br />The story is silly and full of cliche'. The director's opinion of sexiness
and sensuality seemed to limit on showing Richard Tyson's character too
many
times bare-chested. The actual sex scenes were obvious, boring and
overplayed by the soundtrack.
Just for fun, it was interesting to see a young Milla Jovovich, and a cameo
of Kristy McNichol, plus the guy from &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; Herve'
Villechaize.<br /><br />Some of the comments here have described this movie among the most exciting
ever seen.... Well, if you are 12, or you work for the movie producers,
maybe.
Our suggestions, if you want to see a good movie that fulfill the promises
of passion, great chemistry among the 2 lead actors and wonderful love
scenes, are &quot;The end of an affair&quot;, or &quot;The last tango in
Paris&quot;.<br /><br />
