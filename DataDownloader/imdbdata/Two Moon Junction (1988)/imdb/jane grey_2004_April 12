....this is my favourite film ever!  I love it sooo much,
beautiful cast for
a start, Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Tyson are the most gorgeous couple and
have great chemistry together.  I first saw this film when I was 15 years
old, I was desperate to watch it and my big sister let me!!since then i've
been facinated by passion and fantasies. It truly awakens all your
desires,
the music is sooo haunting and beautiful, the scenery is breathtaking, I
never knew a carnival could be so erotic!  This is pure drama, remember
those first flutters you have at the beginning of love, well this film
takes
you back to that wonderful feeling and it does everytime you watch it!
10/10
