The leads are charismatic and the story -- though cliched, is charming.
The
pathos of the double-minded complexities traditional southern family is
interspersed with good old knee quivering sex!!  As all have commented,
Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Tyson make it impossible to take your eyes off
them. Otherwise, hit the FF button until they appear again. Burl Ives and
Louise Fletcher make wonderful villians.<br /><br />I would love to learn how they keep all that white clean -- I can't wear
white for more than five minutes, much less all the exertion these folks
keep up!!
