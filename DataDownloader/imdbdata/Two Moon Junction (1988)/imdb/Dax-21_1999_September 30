<br /><br />Zalman King is expert at producing soft porn rubbish that is about as
erotic as ground grit, but Two Moon Junction is the exception, saved
almost
single handedly by Sherilynn Fenn, who is excellent in the role of little
rich girl April, who falls for a hunky carnie on the eve of her
wedding.<br /><br />A great acting performance...not to mention a great body, which she shows
off to an appreciative audience (in my house, anyway). two moon junction
actually appeals to women as much as men.<br /><br />If you are forced to watch a Zalman King movie, make it this
one.
