I loved this movie! In fact I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it
to end. Richard Tyson was beyond hot and Sherilyn Fenn was beautiful.
Both were sexy, sensual and desirable and played their part perfectly.
I loved the chemistry between these two characters and I thoroughly
enjoyed the storyline so much so I wished it was longer. I found each
character brought a little something to the story, but not enough to
detract from the central focus of the plot. The soundtrack I found to
be very haunting and although I knew it was pure instrumental when I
bought it, I still wish there were the other few songs that weren't
included from the movie. I would love for there to be a special edition
DVD of the movie, perhaps with extra footage of deleted scenes and
other bonus features. The ending was great, but what would have really
made it better was if April didn't marry Chad, (which I assume is what
she did due to the wedding ring that we saw on her finger at the end of
the movie in the shower scene) and instead ran of to be with Perry. At
least that's what I would have done!
