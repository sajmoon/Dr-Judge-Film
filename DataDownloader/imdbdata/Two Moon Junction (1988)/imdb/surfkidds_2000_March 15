Okay, so certain aspects of Two Moon are predictable, maybe even hokey.  Who
cares?  Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Tyson are phenomenal (both in looks and
acting), sets are great, and the cinematography is even better. Music is
killer and classic. The supporting cast, including Louis Fletcher (Nurse
Rachet!) and Burl Ives, does an outstanding job!<br /><br />I've been watching this film since if first came out, and I still watch it
every time I get the chance. Can't wait to get a DVD player so I can see the
widescreen version.  This movie definitely ranks in my top ten favourites.
Make sure you rent/buy this movie - it's well worth it.  Unless you're
staking your professional reputation on it, this movie is a definite two
thumbs up!
