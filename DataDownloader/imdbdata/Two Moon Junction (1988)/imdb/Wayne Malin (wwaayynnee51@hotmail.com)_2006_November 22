Southern belle April Delonpre (Sherilyn Fenn) is out of school and all
set for a prearranged marriage with Chad (Martin Hewitt). However she
meets Perry (Richard Tyson) who is low class and works with a carnival.
They start having sex and falling in love and April&#39;s family is
horrified...<br /><br />Basically an R rated porno film for guys--there&#39;s plenty of nude shots
of Fenn but very few of Tyson. I hated the film but I actually thought
this was going to be serious. Obviously it&#39;s not. While the sex scenes
are pretty hot and Fenn and Tyson have great bodies, the dialogue is
pretty lame and the story has been done many times before. The acting
is OK and Kristy McNichol throws in an amusing little performance (and
goes topless too).<br /><br />So as a silly little sex film for guys it works. It&#39;s gets a 6 for the
attractive leads, some nice cinematography and the sex. Just don&#39;t take
it seriously.
