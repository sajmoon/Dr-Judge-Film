&quot;PARKER LEWIS CAN&#39;T LOSE,&quot; in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It&#39;s hard
to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always
funny when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. When I think
about it, I remember the openings sequence and theme song vaguely.
Despite the fact that it was a short-lived series, it would have been
nice if all the main characters had stayed with the show throughout its
entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its
entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production
design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the
writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope some network
brings it back on the air for fans of the show to see.
