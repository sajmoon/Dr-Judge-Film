2010_January 27 
Had a hard time picking this one up from a brick and mortar (Best Buy,
Fry&#x27;s, Wal-Turd) but was able to find that I could order it on-line and
have it within a week. Well, that just wouldn&#x27;t do seeing as I was
weeks in the planning of a Season 2 Marathon on my day off with several
friends. After much wasted gas, I decided to contact the Shout! Factory
web page and found an independent store that had a copy in for sale.
Needless to say, I came home happy and Lewis Fat. Thank God for
Waterloo in Austin. Ten bucks beneath MSRP. Got Season 2 on DVD and the
Marathon with friends is not compromised. <br /><br />Now for a slight review: Its kind of strange. Watching it on my 25 year
old analog TV on the patio, I find that I enjoy the video quality much
more than on my Sony Bravia 56 inch 1080p TV. Yeah, I know why but it
makes me wonder when (if ever) we will see Blu Ray versions of these.
It should look better on this TV. Blu Ray would, well, you know. The
audio in the Bose Speaker / Denon Receiver is great as it is set up for
2.0 just fine. As far as the typical hijinx of the buds and the rest of
the crew, its business as usual. I dig it and am glad to see the second
season of this in an official release. Kudos. <br /><br />I hope that the Final Season of the series has a future on DVD. There
are a lot of younger friends (mid 20s) that I have shown this series to
in the past couple of years that absolutely dig on it like it it
something new. Had a few even say that its better than anything out
there now. They need to have closure as do the rest of us. I hope that
Shout! sees fit to release the Final Season officially soon. Please
check out their site and ask them for Season 3. <br /><br />Trace in Austin <br /><br />Taj Johnson for Freddie Mercury BioPic!!
