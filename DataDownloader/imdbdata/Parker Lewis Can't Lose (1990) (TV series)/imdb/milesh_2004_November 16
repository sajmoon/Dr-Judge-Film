I have only fond memories of this show and for me it set the standard
for teen comedies when it was running. The later competing Ferris
Beuller show didn't hold a candle to it. The site-gags were well done,
the cheeziness of the show was an asset, not a liability, and it was
consistently witty and clever; the likes of which hadn't really been
equalled until the Buffy series arrived on the scene many years later.<br /><br />Still, I have yet to find this in any video or DVD form. I'd really
like to watch the series again (as would my then-college roommate when
the series came out). It was a sleeper and still has a semi-cult
following. It's a shame that it is yet another common example of good
series' that keep falling victim to TV execs who only care about dumbed
down franchise material and instant gratification.<br /><br />What's the hold up folks? Put out the DVD boxed set now!!!!
