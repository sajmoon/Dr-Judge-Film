Me and my sister used to watch this damn show all the time back in the
day.
We LOVED it. And we wept when it was cancelled. We WEPT. Most
GroundBreaking
shows do end up getting cancelled though. But like my old man said,
&quot;Crying
won't do anything. You have to take action!&quot; So me and my sister started a
letter writing campaign to get this show brought back. Of course, we
started
said campaign last week, but you never know! you never, NEVER
know!!!
