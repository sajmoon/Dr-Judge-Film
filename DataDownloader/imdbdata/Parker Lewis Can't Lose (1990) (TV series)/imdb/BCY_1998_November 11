A superb series which only lasted for three seasons.  Each episode was
meaningful and whilst there were sight gags, the series developed into
monologues about relationships, which was handled in a humorous and witty
manner.  The characters evolved and in particular, Kubiac went from being a
brute to someone with a three dimensional character who actually had
feelings and emotions.<br /><br />
