This show is so hilarious.  It's a really fun show, the characters are
cool,
and I long for the day that it returns to syndicated television.  If you
love early 90s pop culture references, wacky situational comedies,
light-hearted humor with an optimistic and fresh feel, then this is the
show
for you.
