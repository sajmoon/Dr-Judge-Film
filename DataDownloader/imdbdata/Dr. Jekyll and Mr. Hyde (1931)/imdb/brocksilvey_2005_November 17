What happened to movies in the late 30's and early 40's? Why did they
become so stale and stagey? &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; would be
considered downright antique to many of today's casual filmgoers, but
it feels so much more dynamic technically and thematically than many
films that came out later in its decade. The answer, of course, is that
this movie came out before enforcement of the Production Code, at which
time artistry in films--both style and substance--took a nose dive.<br /><br />This film is worth watching for its stunning camera work alone. It
doesn't suffer from any of the awkwardness other films working in the
early years of sound do. The camera's always moving, there's terrific
use of light and shadow, and the scenes showing the transformation of
Jekyll to Hyde are seamlessly filmed in what appear to be uninterrupted
shots, leaving you to ponder the sheer physical behind-the-scenes
mechanics of them.<br /><br />But this movie isn't just more technically advanced than films later in
the decade; it's more adult in content too. No filming of this story
ten years later (I've not seen the Victor Fleming version for
comparison) would dare add the level of sexuality that this story does.
Fredric March is very good in the dual role, and when he transforms
into Mr. Hyde, you can see that it's everything within his power not to
rip the dress right off whatever female he happens to be with and mount
her right there. I'm not exaggerating; the film is really that frank.<br /><br />Creepy good fun.<br /><br />Grade: A-
