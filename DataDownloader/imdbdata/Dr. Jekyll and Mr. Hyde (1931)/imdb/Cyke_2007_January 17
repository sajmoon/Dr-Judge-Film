060: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) - released 12/31/1931; viewed
5/28/06.<br /><br />KEVIN: I entirely expected Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to be a completely
standard phoned-in studio horror film. What I didn&#39;t expect was a
disturbing and innovative psychological thriller. I&#39;ve never seen
point-of-view photography so far, and the film is filled with more
special effects than any film since Thief of Baghdad. The scenes where
Jekyll transforms into Hyde are especially creepy and in-your-face.
Unlike most horror movies, I&#39;ve actually read Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s
original novel. The novel is structured in such a way that no film
could ever simply be a straight adaptation of it. So each film takes a
unique approach, usually giving us the story from Jekyll&#39;s perspective,
which the novel doesn&#39;t do until the end when he dies. The makeup in
the film, although kind of cheesy, works to make Hyde look nothing like
Fredric March&#39;s Dr. Jekyll. Hyde&#39;s appearance looks somewhat de-evolved
(similar to how he&#39;s described in the novel), and March&#39;s performance
is a bit over-the-top, but nonetheless effective. Both Miriam Hopkins
and Rose Hobart also turn in memorable performances as the objects of
the divided doctor&#39;s affections. Hopkins&#39; performance of Ivy is an
excellent demonstration of the film&#39;s paranoid themes that evil could
be lurking anywhere you go. Each version of Jekyll &amp; Hyde must delve
into the philosophical and moral implications of Jekyll&#39;s experiments,
as they are a motivating factor for him. Here, the doctor makes some
compelling points about the benefits of better understanding and
isolating the good side of man from the evil side, but his theory does
raise some disturbing questions. He claims that with such a split, the
good side would be allowed to thrive, while the evil side could
&quot;fulfill itself&quot; and trouble man no more. What do you mean &quot;fulfill
itself&quot;? Does he mean for a man to satisfy his bloodlust quota and move
on with life sin-free? Surely if the good side is able to thrive, so
will the evil side, which is exactly what we see in the story.<br /><br />DOUG: We close out a glorious&#151;glorious I tell you!&#151;year at the movies
with this horror show from Paramount, directed by Russian import Rouben
Mamoulian. I&#39;d never heard of him before, but he&#39;s directed a lot of
classics like Love Me Tonight and Porgy and Bess. From this film, it&#39;s
clear he was a good director who, along with his cinematographer Karl
Struss, did innovative things with the camera while everyone else was
still figuring out what to do with sound. The p.o.v. shots are awesome,
and really help the movie stand out. No one was doing p.o.v. shots at
this time. I look forward to seeing more from this guy later on. Like
the Universal horror shows, this one takes most of its material not
from the book, but from the play. Fredrich March plays a very
convincing dual role as Dr. Jekyll (which everyone pronounces JEE-kill
in this film for some reason) and the evil Mr. Hyde, though he overacts
a lot, especially playing Hyde. Nonetheless, his performance fits right
in with the other great horror movie bad guys of the day. He does a
decent job speaking around those gigantic Hyde teeth; I think they
should have done without them. Miriam Hopkins and Rose Hobart turn in
excellent supporting performances as Ivy and Muriel. I hope in later
adaptations of the story, we get more of a sense about how when Jekyll
turns into Hyde, he actually enjoys the release of being Hyde, which
makes the transformation very difficult to fight, and also, maybe, the
reason why Jekyll doesn&#39;t just kill himself. I also wanted to see
something about how Jekyll can&#39;t ever get rid of Hyde, because once
those impulses taste freedom, they can never be put back again.<br /><br />Last film: Mata Hari (1931). Next film viewed: Tarzan the Ape Man
(1932). Next film chronologically: Shanghai Express (1932).
