This adaptation of the novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is quite
interesting if you have read the book. The main differences between the
novel and the movie are that the movie removes the novels narrator, Mr.
Utterson. The movie also adds a female love interest for both Jekyll
and Hyde which are not seen in the book. This is done for Hollywood's
need for a love story. The ending of the movie is different then that
off the movie but this only brings a different feeling of closure at
the end. Over all this is a relatively good adaptation of a novel to a
book and is a relatively good movie over all. I personally still
enjoyed reading the novel cause it provides more of a sense of
involvement in the story.
