I watched Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde on the same day that I watched a Chinese
war movie called Musa the Warrior. When I was watching that, I watch a man
in full view pull a spear out of his stomach as blood came out. The camera
was relentless, it showed everything, leaving me and my ignorant self to
wonder how they pulled off that cinematic trick. Then I watched Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde starring Frederic March (who looks so much different than he
does 15 years later in Best Years of Our Lives). As I watched the frequent
transitions into Mr. Hyde and the looking-dead-into the mirror, I again
found myself wondering how they did it. This movie, an original, never
equalled horror masterpiece made in the same year as Dracula and
Frankenstein (the same can be said about both of them), is full of cinematic
wonders. It starts off captivating you, as it shows you everthing from the
point of view of Jekyll for the first five minutes, including looking into a
mirror. Then there are the transformations into the beast, which were
remarkable for that time in history. It's true that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
does not reach the chill factors that Frankenstein and Dracula do, but this
is a sad movie full of sad themes. It's true that, as one poster said, Mr.
Hyde looks like a cross between King Kong and Jerry Lewis, almost uncannily.
And it is also true that the dialogue is overdone and talky. But Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde is a marvel because of its performances and for its
cinematography. It films things and uses methods that just weren't used
often back then. This might have been an excellent silent movie with its
camera work and without its dialogue (oh sweet! i love you, my sweet, sweet
love!). Yes, as a silent movie it might have been perfect. As a talking
picture, it's a sweet sweet love.<br /><br />My grade: 8/10
