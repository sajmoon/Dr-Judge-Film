Thank goodness for Turner Classic Movies for showing this gem!<br /><br />Much of the movies shown on the cable channels are either
un-watcheable, or worthy of being turned off within the first few
minutes.<br /><br />Here though we have a genuine masterly picture of a classic tale.<br /><br />The story:<br /><br />Science genius believes he can isolate mans&#39; good and bad sides.
Frustrated in his love life he experiments with a potion and becomes
thereafter a monster at some times(Mr Hyde), when otherwise he is a
good guy: Dr Jekyll.<br /><br />Shows the dangers of taking drugs to give oneself a &quot;high&quot; as sooner
rather than later the addiction takes over!<br /><br />This is an excellent movie with the lead male and his two &quot;love&quot;
interests stealing the show.<br /><br />Gripping and compulsive viewing throughout, and current film-makers
ought to take heed on how to keep audiences enthralled.<br /><br />Deserving top marks.
