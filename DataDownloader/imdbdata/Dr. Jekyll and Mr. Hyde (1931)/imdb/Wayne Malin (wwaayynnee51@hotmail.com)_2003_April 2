I caught a brand new print of this at a revival house back in the 1980s.  It
was just great--the acting was superb (Frederic March and Miriam Hopkins
especially), the film had superb direction with ground-breaking use of
close-ups, double screens and POV shots and had a surprising amount of
cruelty (the scenes where March mentally tortures Hopkins are almost
impossible to watch), implied torture and flashes of nudity.  Also this was
one of the first horror films to ever win an acting award (March got Best
Actor).  That didn't happen again until &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; in the
1990s.<br /><br />Sadly, the only print available today is in dreadful shape.  I just watched
the first half hour before I had to turn it off.  The film has more than a
few jumps in it, there is severe editing (the sequence where March puts
Hopkins to bed is cut to ribbons) and the picture quality is poor. 
Surprisingly, TCM showed this and they're usually very good about getting
good prints.<br /><br />How about an uncut restored print of this?  It's a great movie and deserves
better.
