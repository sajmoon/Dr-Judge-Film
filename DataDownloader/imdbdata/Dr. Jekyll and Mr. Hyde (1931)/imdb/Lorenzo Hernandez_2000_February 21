Modern filmgoers catching 1931's  `DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE' for the first
time, are often astonished that a movie so old could be so sexually frank. 
The fact is that this relaxed attitude towards sex was commonplace within
the film industry at the time.  Early sound films quite often included
sensual scenes and racy dialogue.  Some, like 1934's `TARZAN AND HIS MATE',
even contained outright nudity.  All this came to an end in the mid-thirties
however, with the creation of the  `Hays Code', which was in essence a set
of moral guidelines and restrictions which all major studios were forced to
adhere to.
This version of JEKYLL of course predates all this.  The reason it is so
entertaining is because of this &#145;sexual awareness' as well as some very
inventive direction and camerawork.   <br /><br />The film however is not without it faults.  It's main drawback, in my
opinion (and one that was common in early talkies), is the entire casts
tendency (from Fredric March down to the smallest bit player) to overact.  
Secondly, unlike Spencer Tracy's portrayal of the same character in the 1941
version, there are no gray areas to this Mr. Hyde.  He is portrayed by March
from the outset as nothing more than a violent Neanderthal and he basically
remains one throughout the entire film.  The less than subtle ape-like
makeup used on the leading man simply heightens this impression.  <br /><br />These points aside, this film is I believe still more entertaining and
thought provoking than all those slow-moving Universal Studio horror
&#145;classics' of the same period.  To this day, even with its faults, it
remains arguably the best all around movie version of the classic story. 
For this reason alone it should be seen.<br /><br />Final Verdict:     7  of  10
