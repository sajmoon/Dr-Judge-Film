For all the existing film versions of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &#x22;The
Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&#x22; (1886), this 1931 Paramount
offering starring the incomparable Frederic March is probably the best.
None quite follow the original book, whose tale is actually told
backwards in a way. The book does not follow a series of linear events
that lead to the so-called &#x22;transformation&#x22;. Instead, rumors of a
strange man surface between two characters in the very opening. We
learn about Hyde first before Jekyll, which is not the way any film
adaptation has ever told the story.<br /><br />Still, the present film has a lot going for it. At the forefront is
Frederic March in the classic dual role of good and evil. When he first
becomes Hyde, I thought another actor was playing the role, it&#x27;s that
good! Another distinctive aspect is the camera work which must have
been extremely innovative for its time. The opening moments are shot
with a first person perspective. The transformation is done relatively
seamlessly considering CGI effects had yet to be invented. There are
other moments of shadows and dark corridors. The atmospheric fog that
permeates the entire film is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />As stated by other reviewers, some of the dialog hearkens back to an
earlier era of the Vaudeville Melodrama. Characters didn&#x27;t just love
each other, they loved each other for eternity! Still a fine film all
things considered, dated perhaps in places, but still March&#x27;s
performance is unbeatable, and definitely deserved of the Academy Award
for Best Actor.
