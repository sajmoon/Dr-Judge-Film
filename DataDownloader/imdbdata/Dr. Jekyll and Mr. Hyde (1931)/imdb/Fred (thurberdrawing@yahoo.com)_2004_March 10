Someone mentioned in a previous review that in this movie Mr. Hyde resembles
Jerry Lewis. I noticed this myself when I viewed it tonight and I had not
yet read that review. What strikes me is that, in Jerry Lewis's THE NUTTY
PROFESSOR, the make-up for the professor before he transforms into Buddy
Love is quite similar to Frederic March's Hyde make-up. The teeth stick out,
the shoulders slope and a basic untidiness is the order of the day. The
story for both movies is the same. A gentle intellectual becomes a sexual
predator. But, in the Jerry Lewis version, the nice guy is ugly and the bad
guy looks good. Jerry Lewis did his homework. The French, who love movies,
probably noticed his tribute to the Frederic March DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE.
The videotape I rented (of DR. JEKYLL AND MR HYDE) mentions on the back that
seventeen minutes which had been censored have been restored. I wonder if
these seventeen minutes were censored before the original release. I hope
not, because audiences would have been cheated of pretty good drama. Miriam
Hopkins as the luckless prostitute who encounters the nutty professor--Dr.
Jekyll/Mr. Hyde--really conveys her horror in a way rarely seen on screen
again until the sixties. This was made shortly before the Hays Office came
along and made reality a dirty word. It's fun watching Frederic March leap
around his laboratory and freak out in Hyde(!) Park. He's a lot like the
Loony Tunes caricature. If you're used to thinking of March as the eternal
middle-aged business man, watch him in this. He looks impossibly young;
improbably handsome and, after a dose or two, seriously
unpleasant.
He got the Oscar.<br /><br />
