An exceptional cast and intelligent direction seals the quality of the
first 'talkie' version of Robert Louis Stevenson's tale. Often hailed
as the best of the many screen adaptations of the story, director
Robert Moumalin exploits the symbolic potential of the tale as well as
boldly tapping into popular Freudian trends concerning sexual
repression. The result is not a by-the-numbers rendition but an
effective interpretation with quirks and dimensions of its own. Yet the
film belongs to Frederic March who scooped an Oscar for his sensational
dual role. Although as Jekyll he unfortunately has to trade flowery
romantic dialogue with Rose Hobart, there can be no disputing the
menace of his Hyde, with his simian-like appearance, top hat, cloak and
cane, who turns cockney hooker Miriam Hopkins' life into a nightmare.
It's a breathtaking transformation both physically (thanks to stellar
make-up and special effects) and artistically and is undoubtedly the
centrepiece of this excellent vintage classic.
