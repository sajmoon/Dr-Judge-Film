 &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, adapted from the story by Robert Louis
Stevenson, has been filmed many times. This version directed by the
legendary Reuben Mamoulian, is considered by many to be the best of the lot.<br /><br /> The story centers on a successful high society doctor, Henry Jekyll
(Fredric March) who seemingly has it all...a successful practice, money,
fame and an engagement to Muriel Carew (Rose Hobart) the daughter of retired
Brigadier General Carew (Halliwell Hobbes). Jekyll also tends to the poor
and preaches his theory of man's two sides..good and evil to all who will
listen.<br /><br /> One night Jekyll and his friend Dr. Lanyon (Holmes Herbert) come to the
rescue of Ivy Pearson (Miriam Hopkins) who is being beaten by an
&quot;unsatisfied customer&quot;. Jekyll tends to her wounds in a very sexy
pre-production code scene and then leaves with her invitation to
return.<br /><br /> Later, frustrated by General Carew's refusal to move up his wedding date to
Muriel, and their taking of a trip abroad, Jekyll throws himself into his
work. He continues to explore his two personality theory and develops a
potion which he takes. What emerges, in a marvelous transformation sequence,
is a hideous monster of a man which he dubs Mr. Hyde. Hyde remembers the
lovely Ivy and seeks her out. He forces his intentions upon her, and
virtually imprisons her in her own flat.<br /><br /> When his fiance returns and her father agrees to an early marriage, Jekyll
promises himself not to take the secret potion again. He even sends money to
Ivy to atone for Mr. Hyde's brutality. Unfortunately, he reverts to Hyde
once again and goes to Ivy's flat and murders her. He then realizes that he
cannot ever return to normal and breaks his engagement to
Muriel.<br /><br /> After leaving Muriel in tears he reverts to Hyde once more and attacks her.
Fortunately Dr. Lanyon and the police come to her rescue.<br /><br /> Fredric March is simply outstanding in the titles roles. He deservedly won
an Academy Award for his riveting performance. The transformation sequences
and makeups for Mr, Hyde hold up very well even after all of these years.
Miriam Hopkins is very good as Ivy, the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks. She is very sexy and at the same time evokes audience pity as the
love prisoner of the brutal Hyde. Rose Hobart is also good as the virginal
Muriel. Edgar Norton also appears as Jekyll's man servant
Poole.<br /><br /> When MGM was re-making this story in 1941, they bought up the 1932 version
from Paramount and kept it out of circulation for many, many
years.
