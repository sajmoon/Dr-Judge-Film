Frederic March's performance is frightening and humorous (he won the
Oscar
for Best Actor), in a way that very few actors today could ever hope to
achieve.
Miriam Hopkins's performance is equally impressive, providing sympathy for
a
character she didn't want to play, and her 'strip' scene is as erotic as
could
possibly have been done in those days.
The directing and pacing may seem 'primitive' to today's audience, but
I
prefer
the 'staged' action of the '30's to the slickness of the '40's and '50's,
or
the hyper-
emotional style of the more recent horror revivals.
