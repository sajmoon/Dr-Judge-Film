When speaking about horror films from the 30s, almost invariably the
conversation moves around Universal Studios and the remarkable movies
it released on that decade. However, Universal was not the only studio
that released a horror classic, and while 1931 is often remembered as
the year of Tod Browning&#39;s &quot;Dracula&quot; and James Whale&#39;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;,
it was also the year of another horror classic that deserves a mention:
Rouben Mamoulian&#39;s amazing version of Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s &quot;The
Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;. titled simply &quot;Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde&quot;, the film was previously adapted with good results in 1920
with the legendary actor John Barrymore as the main character, however,
Mamoulian&#39;s version is nowadays considered the definitive version of
the novel and Paramount&#39;s answer to Universal&#39;s efforts in the horror
genre.<br /><br />Adapted by Samuel Hoffenstein and Percy Heath, the film successfully
translates the theme and mood of the novel although (like the previous
silent version) does some changes to the plot. Still, the basic story
is the tale of Dr. Henry Jekyll (Fredric March) a successful doctor who
is convinced that he can isolate the evil in human&#39;s soul. As he drinks
a potion he invents for this purpose, he sets free all the evil in his
persona becoming Mr. Hyde, a brutish man who exists only to make evil.
Now, Dr. Jekyll will have to face the consequences of letting Mr. Hyde
out.<br /><br />From the brilliant opening scene (one of the most amazing uses of
subjective camera) the film becomes a captivating experience thanks to
the very artistic style that Mamoulian gives to the film. A former
Broadway director, Mamoulian responds to Universal&#39;s famous
expressionist art direction with a brave and intelligent use of the
camera. It&#39;s amazing that in this his third film Mamoulian already
shows a domain of this new language, leaving an influential work still
relevant to this day. The way the film is edited is also another of
Mamoulian&#39;s impressive creations, as he plays with the subconscious via
transparent merging of images, and a lot of sexual imagery (a bold move
even for a pre-Hays code film).<br /><br />Hoffenstein and Heath&#39;s adaptation of the story has now become the best
remembered version of the novel, mainly because it translates
remarkably well the story from paper (written from the point of view of
one of Jekyll&#39;s friends) to visuals (making Jekyll the lead) with
better results than the 1920s version. Just as brave as Mamoulian&#39;s
bold use of sexual imagery is the sexual innuendo that fills the
script, and is also one of the films that are not only horrific in
imagery, but also in words. Hyde&#39;s words have a powerful psychological
impact that more than 70 years later still give the chills when
pronounced by March.<br /><br />And this takes us to Fredric March&#39;s performance as both Jekyll &amp; Hyde.
While it&#39;s certainly difficult to beat the legendary Barrymore, March
really succeeds in making an equally impressive performance by making
his own interpretation of the character (his Hyde seems less sinister,
but considerably more aggressive, primal and brutal), giving the final
touch to Mamoulian&#39;s outstanding version of the novel. Another
highlight is Miriam Hopkins&#39; performance as Ivy Pearson, a prostitute
that becomes the focus of Hyde&#39;s most violent actions. Hopkins really
transmits the fear that this man creates and in a frighteningly
believable performance becomes our eyes in the chaos. Rose Hobart and
Holmes Herbert complete the cast, but none reach the high levels of
perfection that both March and Hopkins achieve.<br /><br />Being a fan of the silent version with Barrymore I was expecting a very
disappointing film, so my surprise was huge at discovering that not
only this film equals the first one in terms of acting, it&#39;s an overall
superior film in many other aspects. Mamoulian&#39;s film is a jewel on the
level of the more famous Universal&#39;s films, and possibly outshines them
too as it&#39;s a proof that with inventive and creativity one can create a
great film despite the low-budget. The 1931 version of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde&quot; really lives up to the hype of being &quot;the definitive version&quot;
of R.L. Stevenson&#39;s famed novel.<br /><br />It&#39;s sad that Mamoulian was literally fired from the movie industry in
the 60s, after being one of the most inventive (although less prolific)
directors. Still, his knowledge as Broadway director and his enormous
creativity played an important role in the films he directed, and &quot;Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is probably among the top 5 of his career. 10/10.
Definitely a must-see.
