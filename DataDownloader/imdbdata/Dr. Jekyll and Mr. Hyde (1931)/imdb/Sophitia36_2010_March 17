I don&#x27;t really understand the very good ratings for this film. Of
course, as a film, it was quite good. The actor playing Jekyll was
gorgeous and had a lot of charisma, the special effects were good for
the time, and there were some interesting shots. Overall it was classy.
However, I really loved the book and I am bitterly disappointed by this
adaptation. I am not the kind of person who trashes a film adaptation
just because they made a few changes to the book, because I think they
can be necessary, but I don&#x27;t like it when they make changes that alter
completely the essence of the story. I hate the fact that they had to
include so many women, and that in short, the whole film seems to imply
Jekyll&#x27;s main motivation was lust : his &#x22;fall&#x22; is partly provoked by
the fact that he can&#x27;t marry quickly and have sex with his bride, and
when he becomes Hyde, the only thing he seems to be interested in is
raping this poor woman. I also hated the way they changed the ending, I
thought it was completely unnecessary and took away all the subtlety
out of it.<br /><br />What I find really puzzling, is the fact that people always seem to
trash recent film adaptations of literary masterpieces, supposedly
because they betray the story by altering the original material. And
yet, the more I look at older adaptations, the more I realize that
usually they are a lot more unfaithful than the recent ones. They often
change the plots completely and most of the time it truly alters the
essence of the story. Still, these films are held in high esteem, and
no one seems to notice that the flaws they denounce in new films are
even more present in the old ones.
