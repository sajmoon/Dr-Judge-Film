Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s classic tale of split personality has been
filmed before in 1920 with John Barrymore and in 1941 with Spencer
Tracy, but Rouben Mamoulian&#39;s expressionist 1931 version stands head
and shoulders above the rest. First of all, you have Fredric March,
whose tour-de-force performance as the good-natured Jekyll and the
monstrous Hyde earned him the Best Actor Oscar. Second, the camera work
by Karl Struss brilliantly captures the mood of the story. And lastly,
the transformation sequences set an enormous precedent for the later
monster movies. It all blends together to form one of most amazing
horror movies of the 1930&#39;s. Even today, it still has the power to
mesmerize and send chills down the spine of even the most hardened
horror fan.
