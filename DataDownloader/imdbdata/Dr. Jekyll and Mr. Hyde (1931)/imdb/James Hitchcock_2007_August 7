R L Stevenson&#39;s &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; has been adapted many times for
the cinema or television, often in versions which bear little
resemblance to the original text. This early version does not always
follow Stevenson&#39;s plot faithfully, but it does at least do it the
courtesy of taking it seriously, unlike a number of later adaptations.
The British-made &quot;Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde&quot;, for example, in which
Jekyll turns into a sexy young woman, treated the story as an excuse
for an odd mixture of horror, camp comedy and soft-core eroticism.<br /><br />The central character is Henry Jekyll, a young doctor in late-Victorian
London, who invents a potion which, he believes, will have the effect
of separating the good and the evil sides of the human personality. The
potion works, but not quite in the way which he intends. Jekyll, in his
normal self, is a noble, idealistic figure who works selflessly to
treat poor patients without accepting payment. When he drinks the
potion, he turns into a brutal, lecherous monster, to whom he gives the
name Hyde. Jekyll and Hyde are not only different in personality but
also in looks. In this film, Hyde is distinctly simian in appearance,
probably reflecting an early interpretation of Darwinism which held
that the evil side of man&#39;s nature was a vestige of an earlier stage in
his evolutionary history.<br /><br />This theme of dualism is also present in the treatment of the two main
female characters, Jekyll&#39;s fianc&eacute;e Muriel and Hyde&#39;s mistress, the
music-hall singer Ivy. Muriel represents the noble, angelic side of
human nature. Ivy is not evil in the way in which Hyde is evil (she
soon comes to fear him and the violence of which he is capable), but
she nevertheless represents the carnal, earthy side of the human
personality.<br /><br />The film was made in 1931, in the very early days of the talking
cinema, only three years after the first all-talking picture, &quot;The
Lights of New York&quot;. The style of acting is, as one might expect from a
film of this date, very theatrical, more exaggerated and stylised than
in later films. (Frederic March, however, copes very well with the
challenges of his double role). The coming of sound brought with it the
challenge of finding a new acting style to replace the mime of the
silent days, and before distinctive cinematic acting techniques evolved
the theatre was the obvious starting-point for the new medium. The
dialogue is often even more overblown and theatrical than the acting
styles. One feature that is well done is the transformation scenes
where Jekyll changes into Hyde and back again; proof that effective
special effects were possible long before the invention of CGI.<br /><br />Another feature which sets the film apart from those made only a few
years later is its relatively frank treatment of sexual matters,
considerably franker than would have been permitted after the
introduction of the Production Code in 1934. I doubt if the Hays Office
would have been impressed by some of the scenes between Hyde and Ivy
and would not have looked favourably on a film which strongly implies
that there may be a link between criminality and sexual repression. The
name of Jekyll&#39;s alter ego was obviously chosen by Stevenson as a pun
on the words &quot;Hyde&quot; and &quot;hide&quot;, and in this version Hyde is clearly the
incarnation of the hidden side of Jekyll&#39;s own personality,
particularly of his sexual instincts which have to be repressed during
his lengthy engagement. (He and Muriel are very much in love and hoping
to marry as soon as possible, but they are prevented from doing so by
her strict father, General Carew, who has his doubts about Jekyll&#39;s
suitability as a son-in-law).<br /><br />Another reviewer stated that he did not regard this film as science
fiction. In my opinion that is exactly what it is- science fiction and
horror are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Not all sci-fi deals
with space travel- the genre has a wider scope and covers all
scientific or technical innovations which might conceivably affect
society in the future. Modern science does not have anything that can
transform the personality in exactly the same way as Jekyll&#39;s potion,
but mood-altering drugs do offer an approximate parallel.<br /><br />This film is sometimes regarded as one of the great classics of the
cinema. It is one of the few films to which &quot;Halliwell&#39;s Film Guide&quot;
awards four stars (out of four), a rare distinction for that
publication, which gives the great majority of films either one star or
none at all. I would not rate it quite so highly, but it is an
interesting example of an early talkie and a reminder that even in its
infancy the cinema was capable of dealing with weighty topics in an
intelligent way. 8/10
