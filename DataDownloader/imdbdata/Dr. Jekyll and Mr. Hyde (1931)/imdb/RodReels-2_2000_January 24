This one pleasantly surprised me.  I was duly impressed by the special
effects and camera techniques Rouben Mamoulian used.  The shadows and
symbolism were ominous without being too hokey as they are in many of the
older films.  And the sexual connotations were amazing considering the time
it was made and released.  Horror films are not my favorite genre, and I
have avoided watching this for years because frankly the story seems so
well
known after all those years of watching the Looney Tunes parodies of Jekyll
and Hyde.  But Fredric March was good in the role, and Rouben Mamoulian was
a master director behind the camera.  Two thumbs up, one for Jekyll and one
for Hyde.
