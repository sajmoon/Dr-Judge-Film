Never confuse this with any other version of the Stevenson classic.  Only
John Barrymore's is nearly as good.  The sexual theme is much stronger than
in the book but still subtle enough to go over the heads of today's younger
audience, which needs more obvious detail.  Fredric March's performance
transcends the horrifyingly simian makeup.  (My sister is still convinced
two actors played the part.) Miriam Hopkins is a delight.  For its time, the
photography and direction were very unique and are still very effective.  An
interesting side-note is that March almost didn't get the role because the
producer dismissed him as a &quot;comedian.&quot;  This is a horror film for the
intellect.
