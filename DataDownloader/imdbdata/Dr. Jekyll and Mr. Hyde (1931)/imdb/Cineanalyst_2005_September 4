As this film demonstrates, director Rouben Mamoulian (Applause (1929))
and cinematographer Karl Struss (Sunrise (1927)) were two of the great
innovators in renewing the role of the camera for the talkies. Lesser
talents began the talkies much the same as silent films began: with a
static camera. The sound is still creaky, as usual, with awkward
silences, but it&#x27;s not bothersome. The editing isn&#x27;t always seamless
here, either, and, at times, makes the film seem unpolished, but that,
too, is minor. This is the best version of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s
novella &#x22;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,&#x22; in my opinion,
and that has very little to do with the actual story adaptation, which
comes more from the stage, anyhow. It&#x27;s the role of the camera that&#x27;s
remarkable.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t mean to say that this adaptation is of little interest; it&#x27;s
especially interesting when compared to the novella and its other
adaptations. The 1920-John Barrymore version features a more grotesque
Hyde and a stiffer Jekyll. Here, Jekyll is, at first, full of gaiety
and youthful exuberance. That&#x27;s more faithful to the novel, but also
reflects the filmmakers&#x27; intentions and the changes in Hollywood. The
1920 film was bolder in content in some respects; it was a mood piece
of horror and atmosphere. The fogy lamp-lit slums of London are still
realized vividly in this one, but much of the feeling in them is lost.
On the other hand, the mirror motif comes out more here, which
corresponds nicely with the doppelg&#xE4;nger (or doubles) theme inherit in
the story. This 1931 film is of the classic Hollywood era. The added
emphasis on the romance between Jekyll and Muriel is a result. This
version is about more than the story, though; the major focus is in the
camera-work.<br /><br />The film begins with about three and half minutes of long point-of-view
takes, with a mobile camera, from the perspective of Dr. Jekyll. It
establishes the camera as an active participant in the film, rather
than merely a static recorder. Throughout the picture, the camera
continually moves--from slight zooms, dollies, pans and tilts to
dance-like tracking shots during the party sequence. Additionally, some
extreme close-ups show only a character&#x27;s eyes. A POV shot during
Jekyll&#x27;s first transition into Hyde turns into spinning memories, which
is in addition to the special effects that allow for transformations
that are seen with fluent, unbroken rhythm from the camera&#x27;s eye.<br /><br />The camera positioning is varied, as well, and some shots are
extraordinary just in their positions. The photography exploits the
sets to greater effect occasionally, and the filmmakers position props
with the camera especially well and in rather thematic ways that apply
to the story. Yet, the photography is most brilliant when not subject
to much scene dissection: long takes that are unbroken and add more
fluency to the already tight plot.<br /><br />One could say this is showy film-making; even the transitional effects
seem to draw attention to themselves: lengthy dissolves that linger as
superimposed images (such as the image of Ivy&#x27;s legs over the image of
Jekyll and Dr. Lanyon&#x27;s debate) and wipes that create brief
split-screen shots. But, the camera is the most essential part of
film-making (along with editing), and it seems negligent to subject it
to a role of impotence--to just recording an enacted play. This 1931
&#x22;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#x22; is a cinematic artwork and shows what film
should be concerning the role of its most basic apparatus.
