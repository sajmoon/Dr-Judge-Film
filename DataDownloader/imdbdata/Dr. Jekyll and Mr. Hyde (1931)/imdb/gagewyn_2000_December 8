	This film has a great deal of sexual content.  Not in the form of nudity or
people moaning at one another, but it is 
definitely there;  the swinging leg super imposed over certain scenes, the
boiling pots and sexual frustration in the 
laboratory.  When the lid shoots off the pot we all know what that
symbolizes.  Oh, my!  Ivy is a woman and a clingy 
wrapping vine.  This film was made before the sexual openness of the 1920&Otilde;s
had turned into the innocent 30&Otilde;s.  Oh ya, 
before the Hayes code.<br /><br />	This is a pretty good movie.  It takes the usual liberties in doing a film
adaptation of a book, so don&Otilde;t expect the exact 
same plot.  The film is entertaining.  The Jekyll/Hyde transformations are
disturbing.  At the same time there is so 
deeper artistic stuff, like the repeated references to bird.  Basically it&Otilde;s
entertaining and analyzable, which is not terribly 
common.<br /><br />	I recommend this film.  It is one of the two film versions with sound and
both are black and white, so if you are 
interested in watching an adaptation of Jekyll and Hyde, this is a good
choice.  Also you get the pre Hayes code violence 
and sexuality.  Whoopee.
