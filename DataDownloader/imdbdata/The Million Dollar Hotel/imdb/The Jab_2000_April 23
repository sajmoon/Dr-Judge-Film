If you enjoyed Atom Egoyan's film Exotica you will, without doubt, have a
similar experience with The Million Dollar Hotel. Both films begin at the
end and work their way to the beginning of the story, weaving thru a
tapestry of broken people.
Whereas Exotica keeps it characters locked to a seedy night club Million
Dollar is focused around a hotel packed with semi-disturbed individuals
each
with their own stories to tell.
In all, a very enjoyable film that is as intense as you let it be.
Featuring
a brilliant performance by Mel Gibson and great comic relief from the
hilarious fifth Beatle character this film is a welcome escape from the
Hollywood movie scene. Definitely one to watch.
