This movie might be confusing to some viewers, but deep down, it's
a
salute to the Maltese Falcon and the Big Sleep. Here you have a hard-boiled
detective, Mel Gibson trying to solve a murder. You have
all
the stereotypes updated: the wealthy disaffected father who would have been
Sidney Greenstreet; the nervous kid--Elisha Cook, Jr.; and assorted<br /><br />characters throughout. If you enjoy good mysteries, see this film.<br /><br />You also might like King Of Hearts.
