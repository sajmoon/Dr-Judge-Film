I find Wim Wenders output to be maddingly uneven. While I love some of his
movies (especially 'The American Friend', 'Paris, Texas' and 'Wings Of
Desire'), most of them irritate me beyond belief. 'The Million Dollar Hotel'
isn't his worst movie for me, but it is the tritest. <br /><br />The story (co-written by Bono) seems to have taken all of fifteen minutes to
come up with, and the gallery of freaks, misfits and losers on screen are
with one exception unbelievable and uninteresting. Two previous movies that
managed to pull this kind of ensemble off were 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's
Nest' and 'The Ninth Configuration'. Mostly when actors are required to act
mentally disturbed or eccentric they use it as an excuse for a procession of
empty mannerisms and &quot;bits&quot; thinking they are stretching their talent. They
aren't. They are just being phoney. This is what Jeremy Davies (who I liked
very much in 'Spanking The Monkey') does here. His character didn't convince
me for one minute, and his romantic scenes with Milla Jovovich ('The Fifth
Element') came across totally contrived and unnatural.<br /><br /> The talented supporting cast, who range from Hollywood heavyweight Mel
Gibson to the usually reliable Amanda Plummer (see 'Butterfly Kiss') to cult
favourites Bud Cort ('Harold And Maude') and Richard Edson ('Do The Right
Thing'), are equally wasted on this paper thin premise. The &quot;one exception&quot;
is, surprisingly enough because he usually bores me, Peter Stomare ('Fargo')
who finally plays something other than his usual &quot;crazy kraut&quot; roles (see
'8MM', 'Bruiser' et al). Well he's still crazy but this time round at least
he's engaging and funny as a guy deluded into thinking he's the real talent
behind The Beatles. <br /><br />Apart from Stomare's scenes this is unexceptional stuff. There are much
worse movies out there, but that really isn't the point - there are much
BETTER ones. Including some by Wim Wenders. Too bad.
