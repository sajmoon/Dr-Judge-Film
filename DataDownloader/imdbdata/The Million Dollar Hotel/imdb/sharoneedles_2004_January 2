The acting was so realistic you could almost smell the hotel. To quote
&quot;Tom
Tom,&quot;The
heart is a sleeping beauty and love the only kiss it can't resist. Even
if
its eyes lay open
wide, there is a heart that sleeps inside. And it's to there you must be
hastening. For all
hearts dream, they dream only of awakening&quot;.
