I was mostly interested to see if Bono could write a movie script as<br /><br />well as he does lyrics. Look out, Hollywood, this Irish lad can
write!<br /><br />MILLON DOLLAR HOTEL was funny, tragic and all together<br /><br />imaginative bringing out overlooked performances by an incredible<br /><br />cast: Jeremy (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) Davies, Milla (FIFTH<br /><br />ELEMENT) Jovovich, Amanda (PULP FICTION) Plummer, Gloria<br /><br />(TITANIC) Stuart, Bud (POLLOCK) Cort, Julian (WARLOCK) Sands,<br /><br />Tim (ROB ROY) Roth as well as Mel Gibson and Jimmy (NYPD<br /><br />BLUE) Smits as this crazy Indian artist named Geronimo.<br /><br />The story, half murder mystery and half crazy love story, takes<br /><br />place in L.A.'s Million Dollar Hotel, a haven for America's<br /><br />healthcare dropouts where the loonies and depraved congregate<br /><br />side-by-side for $5 a night. Gibson plays a straight-laced FBI agent<br /><br />on the trail of his boss' murdered son, Izzy (Roth), whose last<br /><br />residence was the Hotel. Upon his arrival, Gibson discovers two<br /><br />things: Izzy might just have committed suicide and that Gibson is<br /><br />just as much a freak as everybody else there. Which, of course, is<br /><br />probably Bono's way of asking, `Who is normal anyway?'<br /><br />The catchy music, provided by Bono, Brian Eno and Hal Willner<br /><br />bring that Modern Rock edge to the film that even helps Wenders'<br /><br />usually-way-too-long cinematic passages to flow. The only<br /><br />disappointment I had is that this film wasn't shown to a wider<br /><br />audience. I look forward to Bono's next story.
