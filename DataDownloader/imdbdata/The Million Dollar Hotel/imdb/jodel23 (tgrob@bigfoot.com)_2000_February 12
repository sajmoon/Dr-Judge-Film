Wim Wenders introduces the audience to a handful of unique characters and
addresses social developments. Exploring the borders of sanity while
circling around the question of need or greed the movie nicely blends
together a truly extraordinary love story with the elements of a thriller.<br /><br />Bono's influence is evident: the songs move along smoothly with the camera
and the story, while the lighting adds some special flavor. The cast also
works perfectly - supermodel Milla Jovovich interprets the general lostness
of Eloise very convincingly and adds emotional depth to the plot. At the
same time Jeremy Davis and Mel Gibson both prove to be perfect matches to
their respective parts.
So sell your TV and give in to this (European) movie addressing
contemporary
issues in a fascinating fashion!
