There is something special about this film.  For the first 3/4 of the
movie,
I was like &quot;yeah, not bad, not fantastic.. nice camera work&quot; but for some
reason, by the time the film had ended I was in the mindset 'Wow -
wonderful'....  I'm not sure why I thought this... and here sits the
reason.
There was something special to the movie, something that many other films
try so hard, so often to do - but don't.  It's well worth a visit, but do
so
with an open mind.  Relax, and enjoy.  Definitely one I'll look out for on
DVD to enjoy again!
