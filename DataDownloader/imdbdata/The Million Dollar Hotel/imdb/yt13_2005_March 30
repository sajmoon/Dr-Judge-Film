It's a screwball tragedy, a term made up by someone else to describe
this film. There are no others of this type. It's a love story without
&quot;They lived happily ever after&quot;; it's a mystery (the essence of real)
in a subtly surreal world. Not only is the story unique, but so are
most of the characters, which seems to be a problem for some viewers. I
don't want to paint this movie as too weird, but its differences are
some of the best things about it.<br /><br />Cinematography is classic, sharp, lots of deep focus. Exteriors,
interiors, non-traditional lighting, a dawn scene shot before the magic
hour, it all looks great. I can't recall a scene with foreground in
focus while background is out, or vice versa.<br /><br />U2 contributed a tune or two to the soundtrack, as they have for all
Wim Wenders films since the 80s. The rest of the soundtrack is jazzy.
It supports the film beautifully, and is available on CD.<br /><br />If you've liked any of Wim Wenders films, I think you'll love this one.
