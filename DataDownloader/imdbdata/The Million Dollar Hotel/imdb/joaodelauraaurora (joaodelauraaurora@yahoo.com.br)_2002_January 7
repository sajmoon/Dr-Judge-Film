Far from being a luxury hotel, the `Million Dollar' shelters a collection of
insane people who would prefer to be in a mental facility (`three nice meals
a day, people in white clothes caring for you', says Dixie). One of them
falls from the building and dies. It happens to be Izzy (Tim Roth), the
unconventional son of a media magnate, and to discover who murdered him
comes FBI agent Skinner (Mel Gibson). Based on this whodunit plot, director
Wim Wenders weaves a net of references and ironies: some caricatures (the
truculent cop, the manipulative media baron, the crazy hippie, the
unscrupulous art-dealer) as well as parodies of other movies (the thriller
genre, Robocop/Terminator, and even Wenders' `Wings of Desire'). The result
is unbalanced: though there are some good moments (the conspiratorial
meetings among the insane and the unorthodox romance between two of them -
Tom Tom and Eloise), the story seems loose, some characters are
unconvincing, like Skinner, and the underlying messages (like `TV fakes
reality') are far from original. As in other Wenders' movies there are some
intriguing images and excellent music, but &#145;The Million Dollar Hotel' lacks
what is so impressive in his works: either a kind of philosophical nature
and meaning (`State of Things', `Lisbon Story', `End of Violence') or a
strong humanistic appeal (`Paris Texas', `Wings of Desire', `Alice in the
Cities'). A minor Wenders (6/10).
