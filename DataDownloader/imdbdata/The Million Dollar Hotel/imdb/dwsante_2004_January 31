Thanks to the cable, I have been able to see &quot;the million  Dollar
Hotel' with, in their opinion, a rating of 1*1/2.....oh well!. As far as I
am concerned, in the begnin South California-rounded up by
MrSchwarzenneger- it is unevitable. This is Mr.Wenders at is best.I
have no idea how the movie went in Europe, being an ex-pat for 28
years.Who cares about the flops of the story, when it is all about
compassion put in direction, painting, music, all-giving sincere
acting?. Who cares of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;'s plot when one get
caught in Mr Chandler,s prose?.  Mr Wenders has many
influences. Personally, I always feel the honesty of Mr Samuel
Fuller. Having met these two uncorruptible masters at different
times-just parties-I feel an uncredible confort in humanity,
creativity, idiosyncrasy in a superior way, with true modesty from
their parts.
&quot;Les chien aboient, la caravane passe!&quot;. Merci  Monsieur
Wenders!
