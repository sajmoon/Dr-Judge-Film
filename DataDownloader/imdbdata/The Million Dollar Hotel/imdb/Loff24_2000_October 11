Really, I expected the most: Wim Wenders, Bono, Gibson, Jovovich, Davies,
the soon-to-be-star-wars Jimmy Smits and Peter Stormare in the best
secondary role... and what I see is the absolute worst, a supreme dulness in
the story which seemed to walk around and around and around, never leaving
the same place. When they start with the philosophical thoughts, my time was
over... and I walked out of it, thinking that no aspect of my life was even
barely changed by it. I understand the people who liked it, but I was really
annoyed... I didn't like it, since I think a story which revolves around a
building full of crazy people, when a masked robot (or whatever) tries to
find out who killed who, goes where? Bahh!!!
