I recently rented the DVD of The Million Dollar Hotel and was very
impacted.
The Hotel occupants were initially disturbing but then I began to realize
that the characters themselves had a better grasp on reality than most
people I know.  I soon became engrossed and found myself wanting to see the
world as Tom saw it.  In all of his innocence and naivety, in all his
childlike ways, he became the oasis in the &quot;desert of mad&quot; at the hotel.
The positioning of Detective Skinner (Mel Gibson) directly opposite of Tom
Tom was brilliant.  I enjoyed watching the detective try to get inside the
mind of Tom Tom.  It seemed at first a task he counted easy but by the end
of the film realized that he had no business intruding into that territory.
Cold, calculating and relentless, the detective met his match, I believe,
in
the blind faith and passion of this fragile, chameleon-like, young hopeful
romantic.  I loved how Tom Tom saw nothing but treasure inside of Eloise,
even to the point of seeing her as almost angelic.  I honestly believe he
saw wings on her although it was never mentioned in the movie.  I think
Jeremy Davies was made to play this part.  He is a true actor's actor.  I
wonder Jeremy, will other parts that come your way be as satisfying to you?
I hope that others tales to be told will be able to match your abilities.
You have a gift.  You made Tom Tom shine.  Thank You.
