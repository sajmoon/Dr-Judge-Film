The movie has very poor direction with several confused and misunderstood
situations happening all the time. Even seeing good participations as Mel's
and Jeremy's, the &quot;crazy&quot; attitudes made by them make you tired of watching
it.<br /><br />Anyhow, it is a mandatory movie to Mel Gibson's fans.
