When I saw &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; I thougt it was the worst movie in the
history of cinema, but this one is undoubtely the WORST OF
ALL.<br /><br />It's basically a movie about nuts.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money seeing this piece of garbage. You'll thank me
for the advice.<br /><br />
