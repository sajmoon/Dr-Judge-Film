Why in the whole world was this movie made? How could it of been
released with such a story and who would want to make a film with such
a story and its sub-angles? Even more questionable is why in the world
did Mel Gibson even think if he'd want to be in this film? Beats Me!
This movie is so incredibly stupid its even worse than a than asking a
very grouchy person a question a hundred times in row! Gibson's great
talent is so misused here. I am surprised that this didn't hurt Milla
Jovovich's career. Tim Roth is totally wasted in this film. And what in
the world was with Jimmy Smits' character? His character was so
unnecessary. I won't even go about Bono! Many films that are good are
on the IMDb Bottom 100 list. Why isn't this? This needs to replace one
and quickly too! I don't recommend this film to anyone unless they want
to see great actors being total jokes in a sucky film.
