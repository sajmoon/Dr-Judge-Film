The Million Dollar Hotel is not a bad film and it is beautifully shot. This
is however the only thing there is to say. The film does not stand out in
any way! It fails to catch the viewers attention. The film lacks Wender's
normal abilities to create a fascinating story, characters and atmospheres.<br /><br />The Million Dollar Hotel is not a Wim Wenders film. It is a standard
anglo-american production of the kind that tries hard to be intellectual but
only succeeds in being pretentious. Peter Stormare is however terrific as
always, this time as the secret member of the Beatles.<br /><br />See the movie, but do not set your expectations too high.<br /><br />
