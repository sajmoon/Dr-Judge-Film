Watching this movie was like slogging through a vat of syrup. 
That's
why it seemed like one of those slow-moving Japanese films, where
the
pacing is excruciating but the rewards are great.  Make sure that you see
this movie in a theater.  That alone will insure that you will be enveloped
by this strange world.  Remember all those movies where we've seen
dysfunctional folks??? This is the end-of-the-line for these movies. 
Everyone has strange and severe psychological quirks (even Mel Gibson).  The
visual effects are quite subtle; the music enhances that mood of loneliness.
 Julian Sands is a hoot!  Hats off to Wenders, for showing us another way of
seeing ourselves!
