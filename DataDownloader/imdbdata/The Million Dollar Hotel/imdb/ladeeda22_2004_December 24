I ran across this film quite by accident and found it to be an absolute
masterpiece. I adored this movie. Visually stunning and wonderfully
artistic with exceptional acting, most notably by Davies and Jovovich,
and while I agree the movie may not be for everyone,those with a
penchant for
'something-other-than-what-everybody-else-runs-to-the-movies-to-see'
may just find this film right up their alley --- Also, the score is
beautiful and haunting and compliments the amazing photography
perfectly. I guess I'm gushing, but I really, really loved this movie.
I give it a four thumbs way up !!
