If this movie ever had a theatrical release, it must have been a very
limited one.  Basically, it's been put on the shelf since 1999 and gone
straight to video in 2001.  Considering that it stars Mel Gibson, Gloria
Stuart (played the aging Rose in 'Titanic'), Jimmy Smits and Milla
Jovovitch, this treatment suggests that the movie is a bomb that no studio
wanted to waste precious advertising dollars on.<br /><br />It is a quirky movie, and it seems to me unlikely that more than one person
in ten would like it.  It would have done poorly at the box office, no
doubt.  The story is as strange as that in 'Being John Malkovitch', but
we're not given to know very much about the characters beyond their surface
quirks.  A movie this determined not to tell a complete story or give me
enough clues to understand its characters should hold no interest for me,
and yet...I kind of liked it, and have no idea why.
