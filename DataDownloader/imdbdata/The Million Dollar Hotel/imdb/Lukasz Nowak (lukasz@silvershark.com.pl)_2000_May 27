I went to the cinema to see this movie just because I am a great fan of
Milla Jovovich. I wanted to see her next appearance. But as soon as the
movie started, I knew there was something more in it than just a perfect
role of Milla.<br /><br />It is a very intelligent movie - it made me think about lots of things.
E.g.
what is the role of the society in our life, should we accept the way we
are
being looked at, should we try to change it or maybe deny all contact with
our surrounding and live only with a few closest people of
ours.<br /><br />If anybody told you that this movie is about the poor living in Manhattan,
their life, habits, and sins - do not believe that. The Million Dollar
Hotel
is about living amongst other people. The main problem described in the
movie are the relationships between people who live with each other, but do
not know them very well. Other topics include beautiful love, and finding
balance between your soul and your body.<br /><br />When it comes to actors, I must say I am not objective. I love Milla
Jovovich for almost everything she had done. She is my all time favorite.
Believe it or not, but she was great. I find her role the best part of the
whole movie. When you sit in the cinema, and Elouise (Milla's character)
speaks, try to close your eyes and listen. You will hear that incredible,
surrounding, and beautiful voice leading the way to paradise. She is an
angel.<br /><br />Roles of Jeremy Davies and Mel Gibson are also noticeable. Tom Tom (Jeremy
Davies) is a person considered retarded by everyone, whereas his internal,
emotional life is very deep and beautiful. This character represents the
misunderstanding that we all have to face sooner or later.<br /><br />There were some slight mistakes in the movie, like terrible song placement.
The U2 and the MDH band did a great job in writing and recording the songs,
but in the movie they often spoil the atmosphere rather than increase its
emotional load. Oh, and one more thing - on the soundtrack album there is a
song called 'Satellite of Love' performed by Milla. It is one the best
piece
of music I have ever heard. Unfortunately in the movie, the same song is
performed by Bono and friends. And this version is by no means even
comparable to Milla's.<br /><br />The Million Dollar Hotel is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever
seen. Intelligent, emotional, sometimes frightening - it makes an
incredible
impression on anyone, who is at least a little sensitive. I loved this
film,
and I am sure, that if you are not a very big fan of Arnold Schwarzeneger,
you will too.<br /><br />
