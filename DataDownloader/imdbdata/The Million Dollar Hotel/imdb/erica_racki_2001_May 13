A few weeks ago, my friend and I rented The Million Dollar Hotel. I was
looking forward to it, but was disappointed.  It had potential, but was
lacking. It was a little too weird and slow for my liking, however, I do
at
times enjoy certain movies more after I've seen them twice or three times,
to get everything.  However, I just hope that I don't fall
asleep.
