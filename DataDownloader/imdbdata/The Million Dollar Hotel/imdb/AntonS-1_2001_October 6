I've been impressed and moved as I haven't been for years. One of the best
Wenders' films. Famous for road movies Wenders bewitches with flow movement
and sound. The sound struck me most this time. All voices are very
characteristic and exquisitely orchestrated. Besides they are imperceptibly
interwoven into U2 music. Speaking of U2, their music is I believe of the
same nature as Wim Wenders cinematography art - smooth flow and yet very
disturbing and full of latent force. So this combination is not accidental.<br /><br />Certainly this is kind of film once you like it you look forward to watch
it
again and again. There is drug quality in it. Knowing a plot (not
essential)
won't decrease the joy of being taken to the world of live feelings.
Feelings flitting like a butterfly of the main character.
That domed love state of the film is colored by the good humor too, which
is
a good sign for a real artist.
