2003_April 27 

At first I was wondering what this story was all about. The atmosphere was
dark and gloomy, and the characters miles away from the usual stereotypes
we
are generally being fed with. These were dirty, nut, poor, wrecked,
complete
losers, the antithesis of the American dream. Mel Gibson himself for once
plays an anti-hero, an ex-freak. As the story unfolds you get drawn into
it
and don't wish to miss a single scene or word.<br /><br />Then there is the relationship between Eloise and Tom coming like a
revelation that love transcends everything and makes them, even but for a
moment, the happiest and richest people on earth.<br /><br />The acting was superb and the John Lennon clone was funny, and his
interpretation of &quot;I am the walrus&quot; is memorable.  I don't think seeing
this
movie only once is enough because it holds much food for thought.<br /><br />A must see.
