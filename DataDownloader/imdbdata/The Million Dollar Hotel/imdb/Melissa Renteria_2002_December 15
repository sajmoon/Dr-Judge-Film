I really really liked it, it's sweet, and makes you realize important
things
about life, because although the plot is not really complicated, the
context
and the characters are very deep and very well done. I recommend it, and
the
sondtrack...ahh...Don't miss it! even if you don't like u2 that much.Great
filmmaking.
