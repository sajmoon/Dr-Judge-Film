I have to point out that I don&#x27;t like Wim Wenders way of telling
stories and the screenplay he chooses at all. It doesn&#x27;t meet my taste.
The same holds true for &#x22;The Million Dollar Hotel&#x22;. So if you&#x27;re a fan
of this style, please don&#x27;t this comment affect your decision.<br /><br />The Story is simple and short, its telling in my point of view too slow
and long. However several characters are interesting to watch and
partly the movie has good approaches. Nonethless it felt too sluggish
to me. Besides what&#x27;s also interesting about it is the fusion of
digital video and film. &#x22;TMDH&#x22; is an early example for experiments with
High Definition video technology. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s still possible to tell
the difference between analogue film and video, but it&#x27;s getting harder
and harder.<br /><br />In short: If you like Wim Wenders style I presume you might like this
one too, but I don&#x27;t know. But if not I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s no need to watch
it.
