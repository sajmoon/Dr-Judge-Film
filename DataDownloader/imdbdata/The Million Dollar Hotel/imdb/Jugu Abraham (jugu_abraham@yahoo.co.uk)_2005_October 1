I watched this Wim Wenders film, 25 years after I last saw a film by
this German director. I have only seen two others &quot;Kings of the Road&quot;
and &quot;The wrong movement&quot; both made in the mid-Seventies. Wim Wenders
impressed me then, he impresses me now. He is a social commentator who
loves to deal with alienated individuals.<br /><br />The opening helicopter shot caressing the sleek LA skyscrapers well
clad in glass and steel ends up with the skeleton of the Million Dollar
Hotel neon sign. In the background an airplane is taking off. Those who
recall &quot;Kings of the road&quot; will remember a similar scene in a lonely
landscape.<br /><br />The film is not a mystery film. It is more a reflective, surrealist,
social commentary. The first shot of the Mel Gibson FBI character is
from his shoes only gradually revealing the man in the shoes. The man
in the shoes is a modern Don Quixote, patched up by medical technology.
No one in the film is real--each character is unreal with element of
realism. Each statement of the script is loaded with social comment.
Example &quot;you have to vote in a democracy with a Y or a N, a Y for why
and N for why not..&quot; Everyone is manipulating everyone: the media
moghul the media, the FBI the suspects, the denizens of hotel each
other, the hotel owner his guests, the music business the musicians..If
you are attentive the film is hilarious in its wacky social commentary.
It reminded me of the fine Danny Kaye (his last regular movie) film
&quot;The Mad Woman Of Chaillot&quot; directed by Bryan Forbes and based on Jean
Giradoux' play, where the characters are equally farcical, while the
social commentary is sharp as a knife.<br /><br />Wim Wenders in America is different from Wenders in Europe. He uses
American clich&eacute;s but his cinema remains European. That Gibson
contributed his role without pay underlines Gibson's respect for
Wenders. Wenders belongs to the era of German cinema (the Seventies)
that spewed many talented filmmakers: Syberberg, Fassbinder, von
Trotta, Schlondorff, Herzog and Hauff. That this film's true content
and value are lost on many Americans is a social comment that must have
amused Wenders. Wenders has not withered, he is as effective as he was
in his prime, combining strong scripts with fascinating images and
marrying both with good music.
