There's a line of dialogue delivered about halfway through this film that
offers a strange sort of commentary on the work as a whole:  `The line
between art and garbage can sometimes be very thin.'  Well, this film may
not be quite garbage, but it sure the hell ain't art either!.<br /><br />In fact, `The Million Dollar Hotel' is an `art film' in the worst sense of
the term &#150; rambling, self-indulgent and too impressed with its own
cleverness to be truly effective.  One gets the impression, while watching
this movie, that director Wim Wenders gathered a bunch of his acting pals
together and let them loose in front of the rolling cameras to carry on in
the most amateurishly self-indulgent manner imaginable.  Since every single
last one of the characters in the film is mentally disturbed in some way,
the actors are afforded more than ample opportunity to strut their thespian
talents, indulging in all the assorted tics and twitches that have helped to
win many a fine performer an award come Oscar night.<br /><br />`The Million Dollar Hotel' perpetuates the time-honored tradition in the
arts that mentally ill people somehow have far greater insight into the
realities of the world than those who are not.  When this theme is placed
within the context of a comedy as it is here, the results are invariably
cutesy and condescending.   The setting is a downtown LA hotel inhabited
almost exclusively by quixotic misfits, recent turnouts from local mental
health institutions.  When one of the residents, a modern artist, falls to
his death, the man's wealthy father calls in an investigator played by Mel
Gibson to prove that the cause of death was not suicide but murder.  Of
course, in the biggest clich&eacute; of all, Gibson's detective turns out to be
just as mentally unhinged as the people he is there to investigate.  Based
on a story idea by Bono (of U2 fame) and Nicholas Klein, the film was
actually written only by Klein, although Bono does provide some haunting
music as backdrop for the action.  Unfortunately, Klein is unable to really
bring the characters and story elements together in a way that would make
them compelling and he is further hampered by the desultory style of the
director.  Wenders has always brought a dreamlike quality to his films, but
he has never really been able to draw the audience very deeply into his
worlds.  `The Million Dollar Hotel' is indeed no exception.<br /><br />In addition to Gibson (whom one must assume waived his going `million
dollar/per movie role' rate in order to work with a director he obviously
admires), the impressive cast includes Jimmy Smits, Milla Jovovich, Amanda
Plummer, Gloria Stuart, Julian Sands and Tim Roth all doing their best given
the material they have to work with.<br /><br />One always appreciates an attempt by any filmmaker to break free of the
restrictions of homogenized commercial filmmaking, but one also has to be
willing to state when such an attempt is a misfire in its own right.  `The
Million Dollar Hotel' never even gets to the ignition stage.
