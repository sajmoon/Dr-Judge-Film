Here it is, and of course it took a Laureate such as Wim Wenders to do
it.
Here we have in a twisted, nowadays way pretty much (if not all,) of the
DIVINE COMEDY, with Gianni Schicchi, Francesca, and ...,  and,... and Virgil
(never look back, special agent...) and a very temptatious yet evasive
Beatrice. And then there is poor Tom Tom, combining too many characters from
the glorious book to save his own skin. There are many pits and falls and
rises and ... humor and freshness in this film !!!<br /><br />This is a grand movie, and if anyone dared to doubt the genius of Wim
Wenders, well .. look at this 'accessable' film again.
