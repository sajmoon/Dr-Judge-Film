2003_October 21 

This one left me speechless. But I'll try to review it, even though I tend
to go from speechless to wordy.<br /><br />Did I like it? Kind of... Did I think it was appallingly bad? In a way...
There is too much of high quality in it for it to be dismissed as mere
trash... The direction, the acting (except for the painfully out-of-place
and self-conscious Mel Gibson)... But it is just too deliberately and
rigidly bizarre for the first hour or so for the beautifully rendered
pathos of the last reel to touch the heart as deeply as it should.  I
couldn't forget how I had been slapped in the face with an old lady known
for her refined sweetness screaming the F-word over and over, and hit over
the head a hundred times with shots of the intellectually challenged main
character hopping about and squealing like a brain damaged chimp in front
of
a mirror. &quot;Self-sabotage&quot; may be the operative word in assessing this
movie's basic trouble.<br /><br />True, I ended up being intrigued and moved by the character and
predicament
of Tom Tom . That's the accomplishment of Jeremy Davies. I just wish that
the director and screenwriter had stayed within more traditional dramatic
lines. The crucial scene in which we discover who if anyone &quot;dunit&quot; didn't
have enough behind it to  work. In itself this scene is so compelling, the
tragedy involved in the  moral  and psychological crisis of a single
moment
so grippingly presented,  that most people, I think, who saw it as a clip,
would be astonished and disgusted at the rest of the movie's frivolous
weirdness. Jeremy Davies might easily have won an Oscar for what his
performance in the movie worthy of that scene would have been. (Outside of
the Gospels, no one is more welcoming than Oscar to the blind and the halt
and those with divers ailments...) It's cool if a filmmaker follows his
Muse
out of the Hollywood mainstream into areas at which the little golden idol
tends not to nod. It's just dumb if even a decidedly indie filmmaker goes
out of his way to spoil not only his Oscar chances but a haunting tale of
not-meant-to-be love, and fascinatingly ambiguous murder, with scenes of
black with purple polkadots comedy as atrociously unfunny, as obnoxiously
lampshade-on-the-heady, as the one in which Mel Gibson sits in a lotus
position in the lobby of the hotel (the last thing his straight-laced
character with the crew cut would do)and browbeats the howling and cursing
freaks and losers who populate the eponymous hotel.<br /><br />And yet... What do I know? Yes. I have uttered the ultimate movie critic
blasphemy. But there may have been no place in the MILLION DOLLAR HOTEL
which I think SHOULD have been for one of the most profoundly hilarious
movie scenes I've ever seen; it's probably the quirkiest thing in the
movie.
Quite a few reviewers pointed it out as something special. That came as a
kind of relief. So I wasn't the only one who noticed!<br /><br />It's the rendition by Peter Stormare, playing Dixie, a John Lennon
lookalike
who claims to have been a Beatle who wrote a lot of Beatle songs whom the
other Beatles never met or knew of, of &quot;I Am the Walrus.&quot; What makes the
scene is not so much Stormare's amusing badness as a singer, nor Dixie's
oddly endearing delusional aplomb  as he offers asides about how &quot;he&quot; came
to compose this particular song, as the reactions of a character (played
by
Bud Cort) who up to that point has been one of the less sympathetic hotel
residents. The poor slob with the bad toupee is a drunk and a loser, and
along with his  Million Dollar neighbors has just suffered his biggest
loss
ever in the lottery of life (the fraud conspiracy- another first-hour
false
start and blind alley in the screenplay). Now he is sitting in the lobby,
in
his cups, gazing off into space as he listens to the Fifth Beatle, tears
welling up in his eyes... The way he responds to Dixie's claim of being
the
&quot;Eggman&quot;...but I must say no more. All I can say is that I was brought
back
to my college days, to occasions on which I had to BEG the most
intelligently funny guy I knew to stop with the sublime silliness of his
routine,which was wickedly attuned to the weaknesses of my particular
funny
bone,  because my laughter was starting to be excruciating. But the scene
is
throat-grabbing as well as side-splitting. I shall remember it as long as
I
live. Because of it alone I'll probably end up buying the MILLION DOLLAR
DVD. Twenty, thirty years from now I'll be at least smiling at my memory
of
how hard I once laughed. Till I cried...
