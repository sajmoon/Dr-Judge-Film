I've become a big fan of Mel Gibson and try to watch everything he's done.
My favorite so far is a tie for him in Hamlet, and him in
BraveHeart.<br /><br />As for this movie, again he doesn't disappoint.  From the moment we see
him
in traction we start to question this character, and we're always kept
guessing.<br /><br />Milla Jovovitch performs just as well, and her ofset &quot;TomTom&quot; played by
Jeremy Davies was equal to Mel's and surpassed him at points.<br /><br />The movie itself, is about the suspects of a murder, or suicide, that
occurs
before the movie's timeline started.  Mr. Gibson is an FBI agent that has
been brought in because the deceased is the son of a famous man, and as
such
foul play *must* have been the cause.<br /><br />As Mel gets into the hotel, we learn that its full of loonies.  Not just
any
type.. but I mean hard core, bone to the wind, nut cases, not to mention
Mel
being one of them!  And thus we begin the whodunit with three very
interesting center characters and a cast which weaves in and throughout
making the movie fun and fascinating.<br /><br />If you like Mr. Gibson's work, you'll love this movie, if you hate his
work,
this may have some redemption to offer.
