2001_April 6 

I had been anxious and waiting to see this film for several months.  When I
finally did I was disappointed.  The movie had its good points and it was
well-written.  However, the movie moved far too slow for my tastes.  And a
lot of the people (Jeremy Davies especially) spoke in really soft voices
that was hard to hear over the music that came up every time they started
to
speak.  Good music, good idea. It just wasn't done right.
