It's always difficult to know what to expect with Wenders: it's either
great
or really bad. And the interesting part of it is, it's the very same kind
of
features and the way he chooses to tell a story that will keep you
interested or bore you.
Although not exactly a boring film, the Million Dollar Hotel gets caught in
its maker's defects. The problem starts with the story. Written by
rock-star
Bono, the story is something like a rock ballad trying to be a movie.
Worse,
it tries to be a sort of &quot;alternative moral&quot; tale. This tender love-story
between two marginals in a hotel full of sympathetic lunatics is so full of
rock cliches, it ends up being a huge cliche in itself.<br /><br />You watch it, you want to like the plot but oh, again that thing about the
weirdos being better people because they are so much more poetic and
&quot;innocent&quot; than normal people.
You want to like the characters but oh, again we're supposed to fall for a
delicate, innocent child-saint-whore woman.
You want to like the performance of the actors but after a while, can't
help
thinking &quot;people, let's get on with it, shall we?&quot;.
You even want to make the effort of agreeing with that lovely universal
message in the end : life can be so beautiful, pity we realise it too late
but oh, haven't you read that somewhere already? Chinese cookie, was
it??...<br /><br />The Million Dollar Hotel tries so hard to be deep, it ends up being
shallow.
It tries so hard to be rich in thoughts, it ends up being cheap and
pompous.
It tries so hard to criticise &quot;mainstream values&quot; and self-righteousness,
it
ends up being mainstream and self-righteous.
And you try so hard to like it... you really do... that you end up thinking
: oooh pleeaaaase!
