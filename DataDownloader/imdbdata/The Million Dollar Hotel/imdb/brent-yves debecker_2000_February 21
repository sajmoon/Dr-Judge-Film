Yep, what would some of Wim Wenders movie characters have said about this
one? A quite
interesting experience of course, but as we, intellectual Europeans are
used
to say: not enough
Wim for this time! Sorry!  Mel Gibson's perfect screenplay for this kind
of
&quot;alien&quot; appearance ....
But I don't know, perhaps Wim tried only to play the role of an &quot;American&quot;
director at 100%,
useless, even when he affirms that this hotel existed for &quot;real&quot;. I am
very,
very disappointed,
what the hell this &quot;supermodel&quot; of Lovich thinks she is? Another boring
intellectual, &quot;100 years
of solitude&quot; in her hands ....  Is that true romance? This film is a crap,
even more: &quot;********&quot;.
Sure, Nasty Kinski would have said: &quot;Yep, and so what?&quot;
