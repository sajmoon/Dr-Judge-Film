This movie seemed to be one of those instances where the producer calls a
star - Mel Gibson in this case - and says &quot;What are you doing this weekend?
Want to make a movie?&quot; Mel gets some bucks and doesn't break a sweat. The
characters are stereotyped and the plot is murky at best.<br /><br />The only saving grace for this movie is the photography. It's
impressive.
