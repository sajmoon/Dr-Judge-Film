2000_February 8 

This movie is one of the most boring cinematic experiences I've had in a
long time, and it's directed by - well, surprise, surprise - Wim Wenders.
A
bunch of good actors is mainly lost in this overly pretentious talkfest
about nothing much happening in a hotel full of not too bright people. And
during the unbearable extended running time of two hours not one of them
seems to get too exited about anything. Including the audience. Sleep
while
watching, you won't miss much! Or buy a ticket of something good instead,
something without a voice over.
