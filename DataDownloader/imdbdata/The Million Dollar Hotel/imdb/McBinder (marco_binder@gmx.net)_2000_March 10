Wim Wender's &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; is an impressive movie.
Quite at the beginning, he shows his audience, where the
following 122 minutes will take place: right beside the shiny,
glittering towers of America's wealth, in a dirty street, in and
around a dirty hotel, once been one of the top accommodations.<br /><br />The &quot;guests&quot; of the &quot;Million Dollar Hotel&quot; form a kaleidoscope
of the bizarre; from drug-junkies to criminals- the plain
losers.<br /><br />What the movie is all about is to tell us the story of how it
took two deaths to bring the social-zombies in this hotel back
to life. One plot is a charming love story (incredibly performed
by Jeremy Davies and Milla Jovovich), the other one is a
criminal story in which an FBI agent (Mel Gibson) tries to solve
a case of homicide (or is it suicide?) by stepping right in the
midst of the hotels weird scenery.<br /><br />
