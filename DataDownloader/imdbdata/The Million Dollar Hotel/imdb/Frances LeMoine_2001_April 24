Subject: Million Dollar Hotel (2000)<br /><br />A lovely, lyrical, magical film about many ideas, not the least of which
is
the strength of the weak. The plot revolves around several &quot;loonies&quot; in a
hotel for those with no where else to go. Billed as a murder mystery, I
suppose it is that, too. Barely. I had no interest in who the killer was.
Just wanted these people's lives to unfold before me forever. Mel Gibson
does a very interesting and funny parody of his cop persona; the actor who
plays Tom Tom is terrific as a presumably dim-witted gopher to the various
inhabitants (he calls himself &quot;the beggar's butler&quot;),Milla Jovovich is a
leading lady of sorts, a constant smoker and reader who describes herself
as
fictional; and, Jimmy Smits as Geronimo, a Latino Indian-chief wannabe, an
artist in hiding and up-front scam artist. I'm not a film reviewer, and I
have always been partial to Wenders' films. That being said, I'm going
downstairs now to watch the film again. P.S. Bono! Who
knew?<br /><br />
