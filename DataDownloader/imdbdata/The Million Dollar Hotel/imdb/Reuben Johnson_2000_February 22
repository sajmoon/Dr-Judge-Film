The most beautiful and poetic movie of the year. Rarely does cinema move
you
in such a way. Brilliantly acted by Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel
Gibson. U2's soundtrack is their best album since Joshua Tree. You do not
need to be a Wenders fan to love this movie. The movie already won the
Silber Bear in Berlin and it is captivating audiences all over Europe.
Critics and audiences agree it is the best Wenders movie since Paris,
Texas.
DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!!!!<br /><br />
