I was prepared not to like this movie, but its quirkiness, humor, and
irony
won me over, to say nothing of the star-laden cast. The performances are
uniformly great, with the caveat that the Eloise (Milla Jovovich)
character
is poorly written (the character changes radically in some of the later
scenes, becoming in turn promiscuous and lucid). The direction is
confident
and at times breath-taking, and kudos to whoever was in charge of
selecting
and placing all the little tidbits in the backgrounds of the scenes. At
the
end, however, there is a silly voice-over that is so weighted down with
its
own importance that it just about ruins the rest of the film. Ah,
well.
