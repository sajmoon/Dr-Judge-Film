This was one of those movies that in the video store looks quite good, Mel
Gibson is in it, I like his films generally, then when I got it home I
knew
five minutes into it it would be terrible.  Please don't rent this, it is
a
terrible movie and a waste of money.  It is slow and hard to follow, there
is no real story.  It jumps all over the place and gets very annoying.  I
don't know what Mel was thinking when he took this script.  Mel's done a
few
bad ones lately, I remember Payback was very dissapointing.
