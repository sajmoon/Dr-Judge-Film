The acting was animated, talented, and aggressive but forced and
incompletely motivated. We watch a collection of actors &quot;acting&quot; and Mel
Gibson just wandering around lost in his palest most insipid screen
appearance I can recall. He is far too strong a presence for the role of
someone only marginally relevant to the plot. His character could have
been
eliminated from the film altogether by adjusting the screen play without
affecting the story one way or t'other. In fact I would humbly suggest
that
the character should have been excluded altogether. I say &quot;character&quot; not
Mel Gibson. Do you remember the first Lethal Weapon film? - Conspiracy
Theory? Mel Gibson can do &quot;humane crazy&quot; with the best of them. The
character of the police detective could have been left &quot;off screen&quot; as the
point was the detective's affect on the hotel resident's and could have
been
better expressed indirectly in the responses of the residents of the hotel
to an investigation, especially in light of the fact that they are all
delusional to begin with.
Instead, we are made to endure a confusing interplay of characters and
poorly rendered threads of plot that give us no climax no tension and no
reason to really care about what happens to them. It's the same affect you
get when a great big delicious yawn begins to form inside you, and then
just
dies halfway through uncompleted.
