I went to the theatre not expecting much having been disappointed by
Wenders
latest narrative works but was wonderfully surprised.  Everyone is good in
this, even Milla and Smits.  Music is beautiful, the story great, and
Jeremy
London plays a captivating ``skateboarding riding half wit&acute;&acute; who turns out
to be much smarter than everyone expected.  Camera work is beautiful,
performances excellent, story great. The relationship between Eloise and
Tom
Tom is inspiring, very romantic.  Also check out Bud Cort and Mel Gibson as
driven but compassionate freak, and a fifth Beatle.  Buy soundtrack as
well.
I did and don&acute;t regret it!
