          I was shocked when I read some of the comments viewing the movie
as good or better. In my opinion it was the worst movie I've seen so far
this year or any other year for that matter. It goes to show how varied our
tastes are. Isn't the fact that it didn't have a theatrical release (or did
it) say something about the movie? Oh well back to GWTW.
