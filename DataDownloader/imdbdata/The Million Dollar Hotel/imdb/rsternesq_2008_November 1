This film is more interesting than most but far from great. The best
thing in it is Gibson and his character, who is a freak (like the
residents) but who has managed to function in the outside world. I&#x27;m
not sure that I understand the meaning of the character&#x27;s now
&#x22;corrected&#x22; deformity (an amputated third arm) but I think that there
is meaning in the odd effect made by his visible steel brace, which
shows as a sort of suit of armor beneath his suit of clothe. In that
rim of visible armor, just barely showing, Gibson&#x27;s character becomes,
literally, an odd meshing of two characters. In part he is the modern
equivalent of a literal knight in shinning armor who is on a quest and
comes upon a very troubling situation. He tries to save the victims,
especially the fetching damsel in distress but he is more than a knight
in the shinning armor that rings his head in every scene, he is also
the Tin Man from Oz, searching for his lost heart. In this melding of
steel and tin there is a hero and a wonderful performance by a
consistently under-appreciated actor who can be frantic or still but
always interesting with a wonderful face and those expressive eyes
that, in this part, seem to be seeing more than what the camera shows
us.
