I did not really understand why this movie was so criticized. Maybe it
was because it had so many themes put into it people didn&#39;t really
understand it. But i enjoyed the blend and I thought this was a really
good Wender&#39;s flick. Maybe not the best but one of the best for sure.
The acting I found really good especially in the case of Jokovich which
i found surprising as i never really liked her as an actress. I really
enjoyed the soundtrack, but the photography of the movie is what struck
me the most as it blended completely with the ambiance of the film. You
could really feel the folly of the characters. A give this movie an 8
out of 10 for people who look deeper into a film. A leap of faith.
