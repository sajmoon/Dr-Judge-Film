There's no doubt that this movie is a thinker. I watched it mainly to see
whether Bono could put a story together. In fact I think the story is the
best thing about the whole movie - I just believe it wasn't given the
treatment it needed. Sure, there's some fabulous imagery, and great
scenes,
but to me it just ends up like a long episode of Twin Peaks - all midgets
and washed up freaks. The scene was just set too dark for the special
comedy
of the situation to shine through.
During Act II, I considered switching off, but after watching through I'm
glad I did. Watch out for (or remember) the I Am The Walrus piano montage
scene - wow.
Anyway, watch it, stick it out, and make up your own mind....<br /><br />
