as much as i adore mel gibson; his &quot;boring as a duck's ass&quot; comment on
this
endearing, charming piece is completely lost on me. c'mon mel, well what
do
you honestly think of 'what women want?' or 'when we were soldiers' then?
as
opposed to your typical high gloss hollywood blockbuster; i'd much rather
spend a couple of pleasurable hours watching a gem like this anytime.
some
of the photography is absolutely beautiful and wenders' depicts an
alternative side of l.a. which is rarely shown in celluloid and is
matched
by an efficient, quirky script by u2 frontman bono.  all the performances
are top notch especially mel, jeremy davies and an uncredited performance
by
tim roth. the basic premise of a standard whodunnit turned on it's head
is
also quite effective and commendable. well worth a million
dollars!
