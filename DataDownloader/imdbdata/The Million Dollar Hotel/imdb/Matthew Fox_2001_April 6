Then My roommates and I saw the Million Dollar Hotel.  This movie was
pretty terrible.  It had frightening characters and a weird and morbid
story
line.  It did have some good performances, but there were a number of
things
I just didn't feel were well explained.  The one good thing I can say
about
this movie is that Amanda Plummber found the role she was born to play.
After seeing it I can understand how it only made 52,000 in the
theater.
