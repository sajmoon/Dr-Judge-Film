2001_February 8 

I saw this movie with no expectations and I hadn't even heard of it before
settling down into my seat at the theatre.  A friend of mine had won some
free passes to the screening and I just tagged along.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie was so bad that I could not sit through the
entire
thing and we ended up leaving about 1 hour into the film.  I've seen
several
Wim Wenders films in the past and have always enjoyed his work.  I did
enjoy
the photography and cinematography of &quot;Million Dollar Hotel&quot; as well as
some
of the unique shots and perspectives that Wenders interlaces throughout
the
film.  However, this movie suffers from an incredibly bad script, poorly
developed characters and horrible dialogue.  In particular, I think Mel
Gibson is terribly miscast as the robotic, crippled FBI agent -- I mean,
what was Mel thinking??!?!  He certainly doesn't need the money!<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this movie to anybody.  Even though I didn't
have to pay anything to watch this movie, I still couldn't sit through it
and had to walk out.
