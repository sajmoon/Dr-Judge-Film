Boy was I disappointed on this one. The trailer looked so cool, the music
sounded sweet, and the cast sounded awesome. But unfortunately, I got my
hopes up.<br /><br />I wont say much about the film, I dont think it deserves much except some
of
the shots are cool. I would NOT rent this one. I like a lot of movies that
are slow, sorta artsy, no real storyline and such, but this one just was
too
pointless. I dont know why it was ever made to be honest. Im still mad
that
the trailer tricked me like that and I think anyone who likes it is just
forcing themselves to like it cause they wasted time and money on it and
are
living in denial. A bad movie is a bad movie. Dang, and I love underground
cult classics. This wont ever be one!<br /><br />I give it 2/10. Im sad about this one.
