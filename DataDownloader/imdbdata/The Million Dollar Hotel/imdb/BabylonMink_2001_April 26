I have to say that this movie looks at life and love in *exactly* the same
way that I do. I KNOW this story, even without knowing it. I have felt the
same way about a girl before. I have met and thought about people the same
way. And Milla is the most incredibly beautiful woman in the world,
especially in this movie. It makes my heart race to just think of her. She
is truly beautiful. Needless to say I really enjoyed this movie
:)
