Maybe I&#39;ve been too cruel to Wim Wenders ever since I saw &quot;Until the
End of the World&quot; (which is a movie that I wholeheartedly recommend);
ever since that movie, I expect top-notch work from him. Which isn&#39;t to
say that &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; is a bad movie. The lack of health
insurance is certainly an important topic to look at. It&#39;s just that
the movie&#39;s a little too far out to follow clearly. Whodunits always
seem to be an inconsistent genre, and this one comes across as more
confusing than anything. Maybe Wim Wenders and Mel Gibson just aren&#39;t
the right people to work together.<br /><br />Anyway, it&#39;s worth seeing, but don&#39;t make it your first choice. Also
starring Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich, Jimmy Smits, Peter Stormare,
Bud Cort, Amanda Plummer, Gloria Stuart, Donal Logue and Harris Yulin.
