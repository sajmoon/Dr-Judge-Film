i finally went to see this Wenders-Bono movie which i wanted for a long
time
yesterday...well firstly i had to say that the colors and photography with
the choice of costumes and make up stunned me!! Wenders is so talented..the
film is somehow flying and surrounding you with a magic cloud which is seen
at night with the tones of blue..it is like a dream and i totally agree
that
the characters are unique..angel Elouise and sweethearted Bogus
TomTom..everything from the rooms to the dialogues grab u and pull u into a
surreal dream where u explore the basics of LIFE LOVE and US..anybody who
criticise this movie about the plot is misleading because plot in this
movie
is just a gate for us to enter into this world of magic..Detective Skinner
is a far too extraordinary cop and Mel Gibson is veryyy good like the rest
of the cast..well  afew words for Bono and the soundtrack..the soundtrack
is
so inspiring touching and fragile and it completely fits with everything in
the movie..congratulations to all...and Bono i was a fan of u not only as a
musician but also as a person and my respect for your brain and personality
has increased so much.. wonderful..
