It's quite paradoxical that some independent films have as many Hollywood
stars as your
average big budget promotion-fest. With Mel Gibson, Milla Jovovich and Tim
Roth--not
to mention Bono penning the story--&quot;Million Dollar Hotel&quot; proves this
point
by delivering
a harshly artistic film that will probably turn you off as many times as
it
inspires you.<br /><br />Using a mentally handicapped man to drive and narrate a story is always a
gamble. The
director risks alienating the viewers or even having the movie get on
their
nerves, and
&quot;MDH&quot; does both in the span of its two hours. Luckily actor Jeremy Davies
portrays the
title role as an every man even with his apparent disabilities, making the
viewer connect
with him rather than feel sorry for him. The acting remains great right
down
the line with
each player fitting right into their roles. Mel Gibson is actually perfect
in MDH as he is
kept in one emotion throughtout the film, not giving him a chance to
overact.Jovovich
too is great as always--only she can be so hauntingly romantic while
playing
a dirty,
destitute and disturbed twenty something (the alliteration was not
meant).<br /><br />The story itself is not unlike some of Bono's songs. While all the
components are moody
and depressing it is strangely uplifting overall. (The opening song, done
by
him, truly
captures the movies tone as any titular piece should)<br /><br />One can tell pretty easily that director Wim Wenders was going for a
specific feel
throughout the film. With sepia toned shots and mystifying editing he
fills
the viewer
witht he feelings of schizophrenia and disilussionment most its characters
possess. The
cinematography coupled with great lighting and interiors make the hotel in
MDH truly
feel more like a mad house than an apartment complex.<br /><br />There is a lot to be said in MDH about life, the human spirit and the
human
animal. The
problem is that MDH says it to early and too often until the viewer grows
tired of the
point. Luckily the points are made so artfully as to almost forgive the
writer and director
for overkill. Sometimes directors get so wrapped up in their message that
they forget the
medium. Wenders is guilty of the opposite, making the film almost more
artistic (and
longer) than it needed to be.<br /><br />MDH is not exactly an easy film to watch, even if you have been weaned on
films by men
such as Paul Schrader or Christopher Nolan. But if you are willing to give
director
Wenders a couple hours of your time he will take you to another world that
in a very dark
sense resembles our own.
