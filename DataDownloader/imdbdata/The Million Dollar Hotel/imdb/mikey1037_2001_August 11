I rented Million Dollar hotel because I saw the names Mel Gibson and Milla
Jovovich, knowing nothing about the movie.  After watching it, I found it
to
be a very interesting and different movie.  Contained in it are lots of
random and interesting characters, and a story that tries to teach a
lesson
as it moves along.  Whether or not it is successful is up to you to
decide,
but the point of me writing this was to stress that I think this movie is
definitely worth watching.  Also of note, U2's lead singer Bono helped
write
the story, and produced some new songs for the film, so if you're a U2
fan,
as I am, don't miss it.
