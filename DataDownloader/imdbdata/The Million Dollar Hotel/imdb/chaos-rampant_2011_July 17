This is not a very successful project. It&#x27;s interesting but terribly
awkward, eloquent with mood but so transparent that everything is on
the surface, all the mechanisms about self-referential fiction plainly
visible and diffused into the broad. Broad sentiments and yearnings,
broad ideas about meaning.<br /><br />So the scaffold that brings an FBI agent to investigate in a hotel
populated by eccentrics is a whodunit about the suicide of a junkie
painter. His paintings (made of tar, a smudge of blackness that an art
guy evaluates as &#x27;large dark garbage&#x27; that he can sell) posthumously
attain great value and the rest of the hotel inhabitants conspire to
make a fortune out of them. So it is about art that holds all the
secrets and a bunch of people trying to decide what to do with it.<br /><br />Now come the interesting stuff, all about the fakery of apparent
reality. The paintings are not his but someone else&#x27;s. Later we
discover that underneath the tar are hidden actual, valuable paintings
stolen from art galleries (art=/tar). And the entire thing gains value
momentum only because it&#x27;s broadcast on TV, the public eye that
magnifies and distorts yet dictates what is real and what not. There&#x27;s
also a guy who claims he&#x27;s the unknown fifth member of the Beatles and
wrote all their music.<br /><br />Inside of this Wenders paints an evocative romance between two awkward
people at the fringes of life, pained human beings trying to hold onto
a world spinning madly out of orbit.<br /><br />But there&#x27;s not much to mine in either the romance (which is so
earnestly, awkwardly consummated by the two of them) or the parody
about TV. It&#x27;s all readily available, every sentiment and gesture. So
what is left is that eloquence of mood, the flatline between bitter and
sweet that Jarmusch likes to walk late at nights. Even that feels
overprocessed though, like Sofia Coppola does it.<br /><br />It doesn&#x27;t take much to understand why the film didn&#x27;t find an
audience. As something with Mel Gibson&#x27;s face on the cover, it must
have confounded a mainstream audience. As art-house it&#x27;s rather easy
and doesn&#x27;t demand much.<br /><br />Considering his antics and the films he makes, it was a pleasant
surprise that Gibson funded and lend his name to this. It won&#x27;t change
anyone&#x27;s life, but it&#x27;s out there for anyone curious enough to notice.
