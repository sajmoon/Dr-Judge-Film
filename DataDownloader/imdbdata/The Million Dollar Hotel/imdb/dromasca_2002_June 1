This is the kind of story that made Agatha Christie famous. An FBI detective
is sent to solve a murder case in the close environment of a hotel. Routine?
Not at all, as everybody in this hotel happens to be some kind of a mental
case, with a broken life story and a character due for the supporting act
Oscar. Even Mel Gibson's FBI character named Skinner (irony towards
X-Files?) keeps a skeleton in his life's closet.
 
Good acting and cinematography keeps the viewer interest alive. Yes, there
are logic flaws that fellow reviewers must have bashed to death until now,
but this is not what this film is about. Seeing this film reminds more the
pre-revolution Russian writers stories a hundred years ago - what is the
million dollars hotel but a Night Asylum at the beginning of the 21st
century. <br /><br />A long and expected end spoils something from the overall impression, but
this is however a movie above the average crowd
