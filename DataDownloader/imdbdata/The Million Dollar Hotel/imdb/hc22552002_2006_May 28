Get it if you have netflix since you can turn it off without regret. I
got it because I&#39;m a u2 fan and they did the moody soundtrack under one
of their pseudonyms.<br /><br />The movie was slow, plodding, and you keep asking &quot;Why?&quot; or &quot;Surely it
gets better than this.&quot; On the other hand, it beats most everything
David Lynch puts out there in his discombobulated attempts to remake
Blue Velvet. Mulhooland Drive at least had babes. Lost Highway had me
searching for a nail gun to put out my eyes.<br /><br />But that&#39;s the sheer joy of Netflix if you get 3 at a time or more. You
can just eject, put it in its sleeve and mail it back and await its
replacement.<br /><br />Maybe the problem with MDH is it&#39;s too much like real life -- boring,
detached, and slow. And real life always has several Mila Jojovich&#39;s
thrown in -- insanely beautiful and insanely insane.
