A man is dead. The murderer is to be found. This is the outline of a movie
which goes far beyond a crime-tale. Wim Wenders has created a movie which
displays the beauty of life and the treasures to be found in human
relationships; his true insights into the personalities of his
protagonists
are very beautiful and stunning.
