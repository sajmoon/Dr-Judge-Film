&quot;The million dollar hotel&quot; is Unique, strange, and poetically, not on
that way which the &quot;theatrical trailer&quot; shows (a thriller about finding
somebody&#39;s killer!) But a quite requiem on a simple and naive love.
&quot;The million dollar hotel&quot; draws a thin line between a film-genre and
poetic cinema, and moving with elegance on it. The film uses the
elements of classic cinema, putting two individual character (Tom-Tom
and Eloise) in a fiction (can be called a thriller), and representing a
new image of a European avant-guard in Los Angeles. The Frames with a
lot of beautiful crane moves which flies us into the room of two
lovers, (+marvelous colors and compositions) has the main role in the
poetry of the film. <br /><br />Tom-Tom, the main character, talks not much, but when he talks, he
talks on poems and with a sense of poetry. &quot;The Million dollar hotel&quot;
is a poem in praise of love. On one side we have Eloise (namesake with
Beethoven&#39;s lover) walks on wet pavements of Los Angeles bare foot,
always reading books, and on the other side there is Tom-Tom who
doesn&#39;t even know how to read a book, or how to pick up a good one
between all of those. For him, everything is new, the sun after a night
full of love on the face of beautiful Eloise to dates on his room&#39;s
wall&#133; and is poetry something except than a new way of seeing?
