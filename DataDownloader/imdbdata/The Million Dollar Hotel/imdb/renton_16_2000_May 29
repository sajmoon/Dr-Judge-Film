Okay, every movie requires at least a minor suspension of disbelief.  Some
require this more than others, but once done, they can be incredibly
rewarding.  Are the secondary characters in this movie who seem to have
one-track minds terribly realistic?  Probably not.  But they serve a
purpose
- to advance the plot along, to highlight the protagonist's nobility, or
Skinner's desperate villainy.  As for the main characters themselves -
their
eccentricities may turn off the average viewer who feels that they just
can't relate to the mildly retarded hero.  But a look below the surface
reveals something else.  It becomes a story of selfless love, sacrifice,
and
redemption in an almost Dostoevskian way.  Add to this the theme of the
visual (in this case, television broadcasts) assuming a level of reality
more real than real, and you have the common theme in many of Winders
movies.  Finally, the U2 songs are perfectly placed for maximum effect -
my
second viewing of this movie elicited just as many tears as the first.  If
you're looking for sex and violence, look elsewhere.  If you're looking
for
a touching, funny movie with awesome actors and characters, look no
farther.
