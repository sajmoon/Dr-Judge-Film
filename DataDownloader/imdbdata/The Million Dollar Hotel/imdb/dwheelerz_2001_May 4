This was a beautiful movie that held my attention from beginning to end.
Although it might seem slow to some, i felt that it flowed with a perfect
pace that reminded me of the Kubrick film Barry Lyndon.<br /><br />There were some genius touches... tar covering stolen masterpieces, with
the
critic seeing thru it... Skinner being comfortable with the freaks, since
he
was a freak himself; although he seemed &quot;normal&quot; there was something
strange
and unexplained about him (his third arm)... the synchronicity of two
imperfect lovers making perfect love...
