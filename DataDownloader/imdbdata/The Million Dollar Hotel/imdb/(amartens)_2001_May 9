I must admit the film had great photography and a very unique cast of
characters.  The story was rich and the twists were well-executed,
BUT.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the story's flow.  Just when it seemed cohesion was
building and there might be a pace I could join into and become involved in,
it got bogged down in excessive displays by the characters - after the first
few &quot;wow, these guys are weird&quot; it became more like &quot;ok, ok, we get the
point.  Get on with it!&quot;  Creativity and artistic license were in no
shortage here, but they interfered in the flow of the story and made the
plot bumpy, alienating or putting to sleep a larger potential
audience.<br /><br />There were amazing one-liners from Tom-Tom in there, and I must admit the
two lovebirds were convincing in their lunacy and romance (such as it was). 
The music definitely overpowered some key points of dialogue but I must
admit their gestures and non-verbal acting were strong.<br /><br />If this show wasn't so long and slow I would have enjoyed it more.  The same
story could have been told with just as strong an effect by editing it down
to 2hrs or less.  Smoothing the flow would make it easier to get involved in
and care about.  I'll be the first to admit this film had great potential,
and I hope for a second effort with greater success, but in the drive for
artistic expression too much was sacrificed, especially the elements that
make a good film.  Much as I'd love to endorse this show, I must say that
the length, speed, and flow make me advise against seeing it.  The directors
and producers squandered great possibilities and came away with a poor
result.  4/10.
