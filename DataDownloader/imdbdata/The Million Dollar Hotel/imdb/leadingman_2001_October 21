I never saw this one coming.  It had the makings of an interesting murder
mystery.  It had many things going for it, Mel &amp; Milla.  However, that
being
said, it was all it had going for it.
The characters are all down and out people with various psychological
ailments.  That could have added to the plot if it hadn't been hammed up
to
the point where it was just plain annoying.  The director concentrated way
too much on the quirks of the characters and not enough on the paper thin
plot.... perhaps that's why.  This movie had potential and fell woefully
short.  Mel should be embarassed.
Take it from me and save 2 precious hours and don't watch this piece of
garbage.  I wish I could have those 2 hours back, don't make the same
mistake I did.
