Many people don't understand this movie. It's not about love it's not about
trashdump of society , it's not a criminal movie. Watch it and if you don't
understand it - read 200 books written by th best EUROPEAN writters. NOT
AMERICAN. If you still won't understand it, call yourself the Hollywood
product...
