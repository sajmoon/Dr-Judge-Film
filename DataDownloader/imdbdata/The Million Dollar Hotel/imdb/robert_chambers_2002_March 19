It is a love story, social commentary, crime drama and personal narrative
all wrapped up in one film. It all works but the personal narrative which
almost works.<br /><br />The movie begins with the narrator jumping off the building. It sets the
bar
high for making sure the film provides enough motivation to support that
act.  It sets a high bar for the viewer to care when he leaps. It fails on
both counts. The leap bookends the rest of the action. Bookends are
functional but not necessary to keep books together. This leap is not
necessary to keep the film together. It functions to allow you entry into
and exit out of the story.  In this it is very effective making its lack of
motivation forgivable.<br /><br />This is about life on the edges. Most characters are on the edges of
society, high and low. Most characters are at the edges of sanity. Some
approach the edge, from both directions. It takes the Network envisioned
world showing how that world impacts people at the edges. One character's
desire to keep an event from getting to TV in an unfavorable light drives
Detective Skinner's involvement. The involvement of TV is courted by
another
group of characters to enhance their economic status.  All the time TV is
pushing to get a taste of the scandal in order to profit
itself.<br /><br />The love story is inescapably intertwined with the crime story. Detective
Skinner plays cupid to discover the truth. What begins as an uncomfortable
failure to reject by Eloise turns into a warm and caring relationship. The
pain it causes Tom's love interest provides the only compelling reason,
aside from general principle, for caring about the narrator
leaping.<br /><br />Social commentary is on several levels. On top are &quot;we need better health
care&quot; and &quot;marginalization of the mentally ill&quot;. Underneath is the issue of
power. The media mogul, the detective, Eloise, and the collective residents
all make use of power to influence outcomes. Political influence, personal
attraction, the lure of a better life, physical and verbal abuse are all in
play.  A small irony is that the `powerful' media mogul is probably less
effective in exercising power than the `marginal' residents of the
hotel.<br /><br />The crime story works well.  That a crime was committed is up for grabs as
much as who did it. A dark joke is that someone from the LAPD is assigned
to
the FBI agent to make sure he follows procedures.  The LAPD liaison is
totally ineffective and the only truly powerless character in the entire
movie.<br /><br />This movie is a visual treat.  Editing is unusual and effective.  It is
smooth when that works and it is jumpy and ragged when that works. From the
opening shot to the end each scene is an eyeful.
