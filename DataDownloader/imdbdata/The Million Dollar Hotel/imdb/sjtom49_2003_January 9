One of the other user comments said for you to stick it out to the end. I
agree. It took some time for me to really get into the film. The residents
of the rundown hotel are all loony tunes in one way or another but if you
don't or can't feel sympathy for them you have no heart. The excellent U2
soundtrack doesn't scream at you but quietly plays in the background and
fits the dark atmosphere perfectly. The acting by the entire cast is top
notch from start to finish. 4 of 5 stars.
