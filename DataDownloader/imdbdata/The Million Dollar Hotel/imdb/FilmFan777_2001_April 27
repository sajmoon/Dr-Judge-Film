Mel Gibson, Milla....what more could I ask for? How about some glue! Its
not
enough to have a unique story, creative and exciting photography, talented
acting and finance. You have to make it all work together. This film was
like an omlette. So many tasty ingredients yet somehow failed to
compliment
one another. I found it irritating wanting desperatly to follow along yet
not allowed to. No wonder this went straight to video. A self indulged
idea
by a creative singer that started with promise yet could never quite come
together. Yet as always, only my opinion.
