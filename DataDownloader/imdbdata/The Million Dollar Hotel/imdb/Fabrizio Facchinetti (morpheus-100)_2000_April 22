In spite of the brilliant bird-eye/Himmel Uber Berlin-like beginning the
director is unable to give any kind of psychological depth or simply
credibility to the dumb characters  acting through this overly slow
psychological detective story. This flop is not only Wenders' fault.
Co-written by Bono of U2, plot develops poorly and predictably adding
useless sub plot twists to an already insignificant story. Mel Gibson is
floating through the story without even being able to play the sort of
character he always plays (hard boiled FBI detective,  formerly three
armed
freak..yeah right!).  Milla Jovovich performance is colorless, not to
mention the annoying main character (Tom Tom) played by Jeremy Davies.
Hopefully, in the future Bono  will spend his time in more productive
activities, e.g. song-writing. Would please Mr. Wenders bring us back the
director that made movies like &quot;Paris-Texas&quot; or &quot;So Far Away So
Close&quot;?
