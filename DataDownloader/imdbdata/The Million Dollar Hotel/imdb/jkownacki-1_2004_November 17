I see a majority of viewers didn't care for this film. I can easily see
why, though I enjoyed myself. It's Mel Gibson doing a very un-Mel
Gibson film. It's made by Wim Wenders, who isn't exactly a mainstream
American filmmaker (and it stars Jeremy Davies and Peter Stormare, for
God's sake! How mainstream were you expecting it to be?) and whose
films tend towards the ethereal, the abstract and the esoteric. So if
you're expecting broad comedy or action or predictable... anything,
really, then this film will be a disappointment.<br /><br />On the upswing, the performances and camera-work are, I thought,
consistently good but frustrating, in the sense that I'm not sure
anyone on the set of this film was on the same page. It's entirely
possible everyone involved was seeing the movie differently as they
were filming it, because it's far from cohesive or even coherent in
some spots. And yet it's disjointed and occasionally brilliant enough
to stand out in my mind even years after having rented it. It may not
be a perfect cinematic experience, but it's those flawed attempts that
usually create something worth seeing.
