U2 just played a concert here in Lexington last Friday night and the
midnight movie at the Kentucky Theatre was the Million Dollar Hotel. So, I
was one of the few people to see it on the big screen.  This is the best
way
to watch it, especially if you want to catch cowriter/coproducer Bono in
his
all too brief (if you blink you'll miss it) cameo. The opening ariel shots
were breathtakingly beautiful. You'd swear the theatre was flying every
time
the camera becomes elevated. There are imediate shades of director Wim
Wender's Wings of Desire as we watch Tom Tom (played by Jeremy Davies )
take
a flying leap off the Million Dollar Hotel. The only other person who
could
have played this character -an obvious extension of Bono- would be Bono
himself (and what a shame he didn't). Nevertheless, we know bono or no
that
right from the get go Davies perfomance will be rewarding, and it truly
is.
In fact, Davies manages to break every rule of acting and get away with
it.
His interaction with Detective Skinner (played by Mel Gibson) is
halarious -
especially in the resturant scene. The supporting players seem to be
having
a good time too, most notably  Peter Sormare - who steals the show as the
menatally illusioned &quot;fifth Beatle&quot;- a dead ringer for John Lennon.  The
story itself is so autisicly told and eratically paced, it demands repeat
viewings (the hallmark of many a cult film). Overall a weird and rewarding
experience.
