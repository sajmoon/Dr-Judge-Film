...was this movie ever made, why did Mel Gibson appear in it, why did a
number of other talented actors appear in it, and WHAT were those who
gave it more than a &quot;1&quot; smoking or drinking when they reviewed it? The
only one of those questions I can answer is the one about Gibson, and I
can only assume he owed somebody a BIG favor! If you take a look at the
box office return on this dog, you will see that I'm far from the only
person to feel this way. It took $8 million to make this strange,
meandering, pointless film; it made around $12,000. Ouch! I rented this
movie because Mel Gibson was in it, and I figured I couldn't go wrong.
Looks like there's an exception to every rule. Don't waste your time or
your money!
