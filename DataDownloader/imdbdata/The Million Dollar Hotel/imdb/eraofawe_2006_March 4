this movie has everything i could ever ask for. tragedy comedy it's
dark gives a beautiful example of contemporary romeo &amp; juliet style
love mel Gibson gets railed with a bat. haha has &quot;not-so-average&quot;
characters with depth keeps you guessing....to some degree and milla
jovovich, my all time favorite actress, in it with an amazing
performance and looking as gorgeous as ever.<br /><br />i am a total cult film maniac. my favs include... fight club donnie
darko memento the machinist rules of attraction etc etc............and
this one has been rocketed to the top of the list. BRAVO!!!<br /><br />9 out of 10.
