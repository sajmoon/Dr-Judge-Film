I'm really surprised by this film by Wim Wenders, one of my favourite
directors. I wonder why he decided to make a movie with such a poor and
inconclusive screenplay! The way of filming is really great but,you know,
it's the hand of Wim Wenders, that's obvious! Take a look at the first scene
of the film: it's really impressive! But the film! Long, boring; I haven't
understood what is its purpose: to show the way of living of people isolated
from society? These characters are described such in a superficial way that
I can't think that the purpose of Wenders was to show a particular social
situation! Then we have the strange lovestory which is,in my
opinion,ridiculous. The dialogues between the two lovers are really without
any sense, and sometimes so stupid! I did not like this film at all. I think
that every film, even if long, must follow a guiding thread: in this film it
is impossible to understand which is the guiding thread. There are too many
things put together without connection. I hope next Wenders film will be
more impressive than &quot;Million dollar hotel&quot;
