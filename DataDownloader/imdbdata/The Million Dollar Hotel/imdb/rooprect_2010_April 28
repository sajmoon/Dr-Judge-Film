This movie is hilarious. Pay no attention to the DVD cover which makes
it sound like some sort of thriller action spy mystery. That couldn&#x27;t
be further from the truth (and it&#x27;s probably why there are so many
disappointed critics).<br /><br />No, in true Wenders style, this is a very deep, philosophically charged
work of art. But what sets it apart from Wenders&#x27; other masterpieces
(Wings of Desire, Paris Texas, etc) is the humour. All the characters
in this movie are certifiably insane. Mel Gibson plays an uptight FBI
agent who literally looks like he has a pole up his posterior in every
shot. Despite his punctilious nature and impeccable shoes, he is
clearly the most insane of the lot, and we watch with joy as he slowly
devolves into a total nutcase like the rest. Jeremy Davies is brilliant
as the &#x22;retard&#x22;--more or less a kind of Shakespearian fool who knows
the secret to everything but is too busy being an idiot to tell anyone.
Milla is another looneybird in a role she was made for. And then we
have a host of minor characters who are so funny they steal the show.<br /><br />My review probably makes it sound like a madcap Mel Brooks extravaganza
but not quite. The key is &#x22;deadpan&#x22;. The whole film is so
straight-faced deadpan that 90% of the audience won&#x27;t get the jokes.
When I saw it, I was the only person choking with laughter while
everyone else thought I had lost my mind and/or swallowed a hairball.
That&#x27;s the kind of movie this is.<br /><br />If you enjoy the humour of Jim Jarmusch (&#x22;Coffee and Cigarettes&#x22;,
&#x22;Night on Earth&#x22;) or Vincent Gallo (&#x22;Buffalo 66&#x22;, &#x22;Arizona Dream&#x22;) or
even the biting satires of Paul Verhoeven (&#x22;Robocop&#x22;, &#x22;Starship
Troopers&#x22;), I think you&#x27;ll love this movie. There&#x27;s so much wit and
commentary, but it&#x27;s so subtle you need to pay close attention.<br /><br />The other stuff: beautiful cinematography, great acting, wonderful
story, etc. Of course that&#x27;s in there, as with all Wenders films. But
as far as I know, this is the first time Wenders has tipped into full
deadpan comedy. I think it was a smashing success. But what do I know?
As the film implies, there&#x27;s a fine line between &#x27;art&#x27; and &#x27;tar&#x27;
(you&#x27;ll understand if you watch it).
