  I saw the trailer for the Million Dollar Hotel back in March , downloaded
off of Hollywood.com.  The cinematography, music, and performances all
looked very offbeat and promising.  I wouldn't expect anything less from the
guy who made Until the End of the World.  Mel Gibson's character seems like
a stiff-necked 1950's G-Man thrown into a more grungy urban wasteland: I
like the contrast.  I also noticed some stop-motion cinematography that
reminded me of Bill Pope's work in the Matrix.  My question: when is this
film, starring two actors already big stars in the US, hitting the States? 
I looked under release dates, and there still isn't anything listed for
us.
