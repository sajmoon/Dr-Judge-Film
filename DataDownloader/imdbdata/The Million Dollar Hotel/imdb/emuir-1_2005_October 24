Let me add my voice to the many who were disappointed. This has to be
one of the worst movies ever! It wasn't the story, which reminded me of
&quot;King of Hearts&quot; and Kurasawa's &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;, telling the story
of the outcasts and rejects of society. It was the awful pretentious
acting - basic acting class! I cannot believe that a good director and
good actors managed to turn out this disaster. Tim Roth, Mel Gibson,
Jimmy Smits, Milla! The Tom Tom character was just excruciating, as was
the John Lennon wannabe with the phony Liverpool accent which just made
me shudder. Mel Gibson walked through the film like a storefront
mannequin. He didn't seem to be in the same movie.<br /><br />To make things worse, I bought the DVD in the belief, from the summary
on the cover, that this was going to be an exciting detective story.
Was I ever conned! Incidentally, when I tried to access the special
features I got a message saying &quot;bad disk&quot;. Rip-off City. Yesterday I
watched the wonderful &quot;To end all wars&quot; then today, being stuck at home
during a hurricane I tried to watch this travesty. I was actually
relieved when the power went off and I did not have to endure another
minute.<br /><br />The best thing that can be said about it was that the sets were good in
a Blade Runner style and the cinematography was good.
