While this movie had some humorous moments, for the most part I found
it boring. Another problem I had with it was that there were times I
couldn&#39;t hear or make out the dialogue. Either the actor was talking
way to softly or they had their hand over their mouth muffling the
sound. There were some interesting characters but the whole thing was
just too slow and hard to understand. I stayed with it through the end
just wanting to know what really happened to Israel but I would
definitely not recommend it to anyone. I purchased this one as a
previously viewed at the video store and had never heard of it before.
So glad I only paid $1.50 for it! And now I am trying to get this thing
to submit but it keeps telling me it isn&#39;t long enough -o.k.now it will
go thru.
