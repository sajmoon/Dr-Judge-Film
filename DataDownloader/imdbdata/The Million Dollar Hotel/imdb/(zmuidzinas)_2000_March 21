You may have heard poor reviews because of the slow moving action (other
people's opinions with which I do not necessarily agree) of the film.  Go
for it - BE YOUR OWN JUDGE!!  If you like a &quot;David Lynch-esque&quot; feels with
great urban cinematography with &quot;non-traditional&quot; chartacter development
in
a life that is often more true than fiction then DEFINITELY SEE IT.  If
you're looking for a &quot;Hollywood&quot; fantasy film filmed in Los Angeles, stay
home.  The film is &quot;more real&quot; in many circles than a &quot;typical Hollywood&quot;
movie.
