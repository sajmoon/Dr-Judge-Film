I remember seeing this DVD in the local video shop. I remember a friend
seeing it and saying it was cool. So I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />This film is really worth watching. Deep and at the same time funny.  Jeremy
Davies' acting is really great. He was hilarious in the scene when he was
imitating Skinner (Mel Gibson) in his room.<br /><br />It's really worth a try.
