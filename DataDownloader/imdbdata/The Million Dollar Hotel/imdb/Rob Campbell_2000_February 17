I caught this movie at a sneak preview.  I must say i much anticipated it,
being written in part by Bono of U2.  The script delves into characters,
some strange, and really makes the viewer think passionately about them.
Tim Roth?  Where has he been?  Nice to see!  A beautiful movie, give it a
chance...
