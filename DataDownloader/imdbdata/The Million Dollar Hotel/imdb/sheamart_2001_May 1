<br /><br />Others have said they don't like The Million Dollar Hotel because it's slow,
too deep, too real, too on the edge, a mixture of pieces of genres,
personalities, angels.  Rarely has a movie grown on me like this after
watching it two evenings in a row.  In the pit of the stomach.  If you don't
understand or don't want to, you could talk about yourself and not bring
down this film.  When they whisper, that's when you know what it's about.
