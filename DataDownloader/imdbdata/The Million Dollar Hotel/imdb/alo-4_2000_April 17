Bono of U2, co-writer of this movie, has pointed out again one of the most
critical themes of our present lives: The media and the introspective view
of it. Wenders hand is very helpful to get straight to the point, mainly
because he has the same fears for the television and all others
MASS-MEDIAS.
See this movie and stay inside of it in order to understand how life is
real
in spite of what is too often shown on the screen. This breath of non-real
reality opens the eyes of the audience on the critical relation between our
minds and our everyday world. It is a must see...
