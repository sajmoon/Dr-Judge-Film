I just had to go and see the movie for a second time! Yeah, it's that good!
And I gotta tell you guys that I still found it absolutely and
unquestionably BRILLIANT! And then I read some of the comments about it
here
at IMDb. What really really surprised me was the huge number of rather
hostile criticism I read here. I was quite taken aback! But... I can
certainly understand them perhaps. :-) I can! Honest! It's just that it'd
never ever occur to me that there can be (quite a few...) people for whom
this film could be a disappointment and not a great great pleasure to see.<br /><br />With all the small details! Like the small futuristic car that keeps
reappearing in different colours (subtle reminder that it's the year
2001?),
or the references to the Beatles and Beatles songs, so brilliantly &quot;hidden&quot;
in dialogues. (&quot;Look at all those people.&quot; &quot;Where do they all come from?&quot;),
and the _hilarious_ lines (explanation at a voting: &quot;the Y stands for why
and the N stands for why not&quot;, or &quot;Smoking can kill you. And sometimes you
can even get cancer...&quot;). And then there are the actors! Tom-Tom (Jeremy
Davies) is exceptional! The way he talks! And the way he moves!
Unbelievable! And then there's Mel Gibson whom actually I don't really
like,
but he proved an excellent choice for this character! And _all_ the other
characters are just perfect!
There are so many things about this movie! The actors, the lines, the
music,
the colours. Magical! Go check it out! You might as well end up loving it,
so N! (&quot;Why not?&quot;)
