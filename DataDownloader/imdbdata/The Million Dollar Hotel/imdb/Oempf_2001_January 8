I am very sorry for the people who liked this movie, but I found it awful.<br /><br />You might consider seeing this movie because Mell Gibson is in there, but
really...it's not worth the time and effort. Gibson put on an all-time low
acting performance, which is consistent with the rest of the movie. The
story-line is annoying, the dialogues are incomprehensible
and not for one moment you get the feeling that the movie is
going somewhere.<br /><br />I got a few words for people that want to watch this: &quot;don't see it, you
will be happier&quot;
