Wim Wenders is a very talented filmmaker and he should know better than to
get involved with a musician who wants to make a film. Bono helped write and
produce this messy film and with all the talent involved you would think a
more coherent film could have been made. They're is a lot of improvisation
used in this film and unless your Robert Altman then it can backfire. Altman
uses some improvisation but still has a solid story to base everything on.
Here in this film its the opposite. Improvisation seems to be the bases and
the main story (Such as it is) comes secondary. Mel Gibson is an FBI agent
sent to investigate the death of a politicians son in a seedy hotel
inhabited by people with mental defects. Reminded me a little bit of &quot;King
of Hearts&quot;. Gibson has this metal neck brace on and has a crewcut. Kind of
like Joe Friday meets The Twilight Zone. If I can say anything good about
this film then it would be Jeremy Davies who looks very comfortable
improvising his role. On the other hand, Mel Gibson does NOT look
comfortable. He's not that type of actor. The two styles of acting just
don't mesh. Milla Jovovich has been in so few good films in her career that
you can count them on one hand and have a few fingers left over. And this is
another blemish on her already disappointing resume. Peter Stormare spends
the entire film talking like Ringo Starr and Gloria Stuart yells the &quot;F&quot;
word several times! Bud Cort just hangs out and he looks happy to just be
working. Tim Roth shows up at the end in a cameo. Film is just trying to be
avant garde and be something of an exercise in style. But an exercise in
style still has some bases for a story and the blending of acting styles
just doesn't work. At best its futile!
