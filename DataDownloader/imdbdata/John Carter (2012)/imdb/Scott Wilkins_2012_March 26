I found this movie to be much better than I expected. I think the main
reason anyone would rate it lower is that it&#x27;s not quite the
run-and-gun flick that the commercials and trialers make you think it
would be. It is a long movie, well over 2 hours. And it does take a bit
at the beginning to get moving. But, at the end I&#x27;m not sure I wouldn&#x27;t
have liked a 3 hour movie with a bit more detail.<br /><br />It&#x27;s slow sorta of like Dune. But as the movie unfolds, it gains speed.
A lot of speed. The actors and actresses are all engaging and well
played. And the story is held much closer to the books that I had
imagined it would be, adding just enough to make a more believable
movie experience.<br /><br />If you are a &#x22;Type-A&#x22; personality, you may not like this movie, as it
is slow at first. But anyone who likes an engaging story with just the
right amount of real depth and detail, this is your movie.
