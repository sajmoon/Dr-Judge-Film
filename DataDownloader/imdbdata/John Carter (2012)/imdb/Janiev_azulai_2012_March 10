2012_March 10 
My first judgement before i&#x27;ve seen the actual movie was pretty bad, I
didn&#x27;t like the idea and the trailer really turned me off, but my
father insisted that we go and see it. So we went to the movie theater
to watch John Carter. My hopes weren&#x27;t very high, but the good thing is
that watching a movie in the theaters will normally make the film more
enjoyable to watch and it certainly did.<br /><br />It was a fine night out and i enjoyed myself, but there is a lot of
points of the movie i&#x27;m pretty critical about. My final conclusion of
the film is that it really isn&#x27;t a &#x22;good&#x22; film, but it does make a good
night out. <br /><br />First of all the acting.. The acting was pretty bad and you could see
it in the first seconds of the film. Somehow you just see that they are
talking to a green screen except of talking to an actual human being or
&#x22;alien&#x22; to be precise. For my opinion it&#x27;s also the script.<br /><br />Secondly the story... I forgive them because the book was released in
1917 so the story itself -was- original, but for now in 2012 it&#x27;s not.
It&#x27;s really standard, cheesy and you&#x27;ve seen it all before. It gets
very obvious that they wanted to make a film on the success of Avatar.<br /><br />So.. A movie like many others and like many other blockbusters it&#x27;s a
fine movie to watch on a night out to the movie theaters. I wouldn&#x27;t or
will not have watched the movie if I had to at home.
