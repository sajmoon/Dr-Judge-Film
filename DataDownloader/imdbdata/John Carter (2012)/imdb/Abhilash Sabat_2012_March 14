I obviously had all the mixed reviews in my mind before watching it,
specially the negative ones.. But thankfully, that wasn&#x27;t the case. I
did like the movie. I obviously had no idea about the character etc. So
don&#x27;t know how far it justifies the character. But i was satisfied with
what it had, the special effects are stunning, the action sequences
were good. No brilliant performances, fine background score. Overall,
it was fun to watch it in 3D, although it did drag here and there. And
YEAH, It had a better story than AVATAR! Watch it for its extravagant
special effects and the fans of John Carter wont be disappointed at
all. Would rate it around 6.5-7/10
