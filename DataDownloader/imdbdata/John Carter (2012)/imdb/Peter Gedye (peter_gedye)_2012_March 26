I go to say that this movie in Excellent, best movie i have seen in
years. sadly calling it just John Carter has really gave it a hard time
and here in Australia i never seen any advertising for it. if they
Labeled it John Carter of Mars people would have thought, this is about
a man on Mars or a mars like planet. i knew about this movie 2 ways, 1
from watching Princess of mars and 2 from my dad reading the Martin
Chronicle books. for anyone who likes a good science fiction movie
watch this movie, you will love it, you don&#x27;t even need to know any of
the history for the movie. oh P.S. if anyone wants to know more about
the maker of the books for this movie, the writer was also the created
of all the Tarzan books.
