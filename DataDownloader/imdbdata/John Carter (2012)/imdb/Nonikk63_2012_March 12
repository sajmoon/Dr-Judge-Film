I discovered the books about John Carter in my early teens and I was
completely blown away by them. Edgar Rice Burroughs really had an
amazing imagination. This imaginary Mars is one of the best &#x22;other
worlds&#x22; I&#x27;ve come by. Pulp fiction at its best.<br /><br />When I learned last year that there was going to be a movie based on
the first book, I was really, really thrilled. With today&#x27;s computer
made animations this story could finally be told. This Mars is a little
more desert than it is in the novels though - in the books the planet
is covered in moss - but otherwise everything looks great. I had
envisioned John Carter a little more gentleman-like, but this rougher
one works too. He makes a believable fighter. The picture I had in my
head of the Tharks (the green men of Mars) soon faded away and was
replaced by the ones in the movie, but Woola was just as I had
envisioned him. Of all the creatures in this story he is the true gem.<br /><br />Some things from the books are changed, for example the way John gets
to Mars, but that is all for the better in my opinion. The changes also
make the story more intriguing, so I don&#x27;t mind at all.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that it tries to squeeze too much story
into 2 hours and 12 minutes. That makes the pacing too brisk and if you
haven&#x27;t read the books I guess some things will feel a little
confusing. In the books John&#x27;s time with the Tharks is much longer and
it&#x27;s a slow process learning their language and coming to understand
their customs and ways of thinking. I wouldn&#x27;t have had anything
against a little less action and a little more story at a slower pace.
The story about Mars is fascinating enough. But it was well worth the
money and I had a really good time.
