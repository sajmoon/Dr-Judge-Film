John Carter is a film that had to wait just over 100 years to be turned
into a movie. This is because when it was written, this Sci-fi /
Fantasy story was so far ahead of its time. It is ironic that people
have referred to the story as unoriginal, seeing as how the story was
written before any of the previously made copy cat movies in the genre.
I have seen this movie twice now in theaters. Once with my drinking
buddy and once with my mother. There are very few movies that have the
ability to capture the heart and imagination of such a wide audience.
It truly saddens me that because the adds for this movie were so
clich&#xE9;d it wont be appreciated by the masses as it deserves to be. Even
sadder is the fact that the sequel will never be made.
