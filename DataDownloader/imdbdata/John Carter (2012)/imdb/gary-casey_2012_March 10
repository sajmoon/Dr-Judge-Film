Really enjoyable - I loved it! Going to see it again today, this time
in 3D. <br /><br />To people who compare it with Star Wars and say &#x22;This has all been done
before, and better&#x22; two points :<br /><br />(1) &#x22;Done before&#x22; : The books on which this film is based were written
by Edgar Rice Burroughs (who also wrote the Tarzan books) 100 years
ago. Most of the great sci-fi movies of the past 50 years were inspired
by these books, not the other way around!<br /><br />(2) &#x22;Done Better&#x22;? Really? Have you taken an objective look at the Star
Wars movies since you were a kid? They are pretty average movies on the
whole, but we forgive them for it because of the new world they created
for us.<br /><br />John Carter is better than any of the Star Wars movies, the world it
creates is more interesting - and the ending was SUPERB.
