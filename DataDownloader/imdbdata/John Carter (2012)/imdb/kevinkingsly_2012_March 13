I dint go with any expectation just the trailer hint Wow the movie was
awesome great graphics and a good story.When compared to pandora&#x27;s
world Mars is just a dry land with some Star wars gimmick.The character
detail is well done. Its better to watch the movie in 2D rather than
3D.The entire movie has a brown theme added to it,may be its because of
the vast dry land.They should have added some more color to it,Come on
it not like Tarsem Singh movie(The Fall) where you need to select
different location for each frame,its CGI you just get a fantasy world
in you mind and you build it.Its easy for me to say but It would have
been better.If you are a Star wars fan then its a great flick if not
its just another blockbuster with high budget CGI.John carter is like
Superman on Mars.
