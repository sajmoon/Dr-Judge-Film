I am not familiar with the books or comics on which this movie is
based. My only experience of Edgar Rice Burrough&#x27;s is the odd black and
white Tarzan movie on Saturday mornings on television.<br /><br />I am aware of all the whining about how much it allegedly cost but paid
it no mind. If I enjoy a movie, I enjoy it. I don&#x27;t care how much it
cost or how many people bought tickets.<br /><br />John Carter ( I keep wanting to type Of Mars) is visually stunning.
Andrew Stanton has tremendous style and the CGI, production design
really did make me feel as though I had been transported to another
world. It&#x27;s utterly bewitching and beautiful.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch seemed a little hesitant as first, but soon grew into the
titular character and played the role with aplomb. Mark Strong is
always wonderful and Ciaran Hinds does sterling work.<br /><br />The heroine is fantastic. Sexy, exotic and tough she is the way Lara
Croft should have been in the movies.<br /><br />Great action sequences. I&#x27;m really glad that I saw this on the big
screen.
