Go see John Carter. It&#x27;s one of those movies that is meant for the big
screen -- great action, sweeping visuals -- give it a ride and you
won&#x27;t be disappointed.<br /><br />I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect the first time I saw it as the poor box
office showing and mediocre reviews had me wondering. I left ready to
see it again to pick up all the little bits that I knew I missed. I was
completely entertained, and never noticed the time. I was surprised at
how often I found myself laughing and chuckling at the bits of humor
weaved throughout the story. The actors did a terrific job of bringing
the story to life; I found myself really wanting John Carter to win the
war and the girl (and the girl to win John Carter). The screenplay was
another success. The movie doesn&#x27;t follow the book(s), but ties
multiple elements from the series together in a way that is fluid and
is in someways more more approachable than the originals.<br /><br />One personal preference note: skip the 3-D. As with every other 3D film
I&#x27;ve seen, the technology is more a nuisance than a pleasure. I went
back to see the film in 2D over lunch and enjoyed it far more. The 3-D
effect is again more like multiple layers of 2D, and the glasses just
limit your field of view. If this were a film of tight dialog on two
people maybe, but with all the stunning visuals, you really limit
yourself behind those silly glasses (or you find yourself moving your
head around to take it all in).<br /><br />I&#x27;ll probably pick up the blu-ray, but even on a large television, the
experience won&#x27;t be the same (well, unless you have a 900&#x22; television).
I hope this movie picks up, because I&#x27;d love to see what they do with a
sequel. The last time I went to see a film twice while at the theater
was... never. I usually just wait for the disc. This film is different.
Go see it and enjoy.
