&#x22;When I saw you, I believed it was a sign... that something new can
come into this world.&#x22; Plot: A civil war veteran named John Carter is
magically transported to Mars which is inhabited by green 12-foot, four
armed barbarians known as the Tharks, and humans who are almost as
technologically advanced as we are. Carter finds he has super-strength
due to his bone density. Before long he becomes involved in a war that
if not won by the city of Helium might spill over to Earth.<br /><br />Directed by Andrew Stanton( A Bug&#x27;s Life, Finding Nemo, Wall-E) and
based on the novels by Edgar Rice Burrows(who makes an appearance as
Carter&#x27;s nephew), John Carter is a movie that could have been a
masterpiece had it not been for the terrible script. It is almost like
the writers, well if you can call them that, took the script from James
Cameron&#x27;s Avatar, crossed out a few things, added a minor plot point
here and there, and called it a day. The Tharks are the Na&#x27;vi, Mars is
Pandora, even how Carter got to Mars is nearly identical to how Jake
Sully got transferred into his Avatar body, etc. The rest of the plot
is taken from every Disney movie involving a princess. When it isn&#x27;t
doing those things it&#x27;s ripping off Star Wars as well. There were
countless times I either groaned or laughed when making the
connections. There&#x27;s nothing original about it. NOTHING. Now I haven&#x27;t
read the books, so it is quite possible James Cameron could have ripped
off them, but until I am corrected I stand by my opinion that the
script is absolute rubbish. It blows my mind that the man who gave us
such treasures such as Wall-E and Finding Nemo could give us such a
measly script. John Carter is such a bonehead his character to the
point where he becomes unlikeable. He is put into situations that he
could have simply avoided by speaking up. But maybe that makes him more
human, still that doesn&#x27;t give him the right to be a total idiot. That
isn&#x27;t the fault of actor Taylor Kitsch, who does OK despite what he&#x27;s
been given. Lynn Collins was the perfect choice for the role if
Princess Dejah Thoris. She is both beautiful and a joy to watch.
Dominic Cooper and Mark Strong as always make good villains. Willem
Dafoe, Thomas Hayden Church, Samantha Morton, and Polly Walker( Atia of
the Julii in the short lived but fantastic series Rome) all do great as
the voices of the Tharks. My only problem is the miscasting of James
Purefoy(who also starred in Rome) who&#x27;s role as the Princess&#x27;s right
hand man is so minor they could have just done without him. Still even
though he has only 10 or so lines, he still manages to stand out a bit.
In my opinion Purefoy should have had Cooper&#x27;s role as he also would
have made a good villain. Breaking Bad&#x27;s Brian Kranston makes a short
but good appearance. Kids will enjoy the dog-like six legged creature.
He is primarily used for comic relief, but doesn&#x27;t overdo it like Jar
Jar Binks did in Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace. But the
greatest things about this movie are the costumes and effects. The
costumes alone make this movie worth checking out and should be
nominated in next year&#x27;s Academy Awards. The same goes for the effects,
but even those can&#x27;t match Avatar&#x27;s. Another thing I enjoyed was the
landscape effects and cinematography. We are treated to sweeping shots
of the Martian surface with ancient ruins even though it looks like
Utah where it was filmed. The shots are nice but I never really felt as
if I was on Mars. One final thing I enjoyed was the use of the color
blue. Rather it be the blood, or the color of the characters&#x27; eyes, it
really sticks out from the red and rustic colors. All in all I wasn&#x27;t
that impressed with it due to the fact that it IS a rip-off of Avatar
and offers nothing new, but I did like a few things about it. Kids
might enjoy it, but don&#x27;t count on too many adults giving it high
praise, because in the end, it is just another mindless action movie.
Total Score: 4.8/10 Correction: Turns out Avatar did rip off the
Princess of Mars books, but this movie could have still changed a few
things around in order for the two films to not be exactly alike and it
fails in the areas where Avatar succeeded.
