250 million dollars?! I love Stanton&#x27;s work, I&#x27;ve said so several times
on this website. Pixar has made some of the finest films in the last
quarter century. But this? He could have made a terrific animated
version of this story(which Bob Clampbett was preparing in the 30&#x27;s)
and it would have cost half as much. Instead we get some nifty visuals
and...nothing else. Michael Chabon is given screen credit? This is a
Pulitzer Prize winner?<br /><br />I love pulp fiction and when done right it can be marvelous. This movie
ain&#x27;t it. Its a crashing bore filled with some of the most risible
dialogue this side of a bad sword and sandal pic from the 50&#x27;s. When it
should soar it stumbles. When it should fill one with a sense of
wonder, I just shrugged. I had the same reaction to this movie as I did
to Avatar.<br /><br />Yawn.
