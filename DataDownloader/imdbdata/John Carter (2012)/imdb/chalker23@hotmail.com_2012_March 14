Just saw John Carter in imax 3D and having not read the books I wasn&#x27;t
sure what to expect. Boy what a great time at the movies. From curtain
up until the end credits I was completely captivated by the world that
Andrew Stanton and his team put up on the screen. The SFX were nothing
short of amazing and the action scenes were spectacular. All the actors
were spot on. Willem Dafoe was great as Tars Tarkas, Taylor Kitcsh was
good as John Carter but I think my favourite was Lynn Collins as Dejah.
Aside for being not had to look at, as soon as she is on screen you
know that this is a woman to be reckoned with and has such a great
presence on screen that she might even overshadow John Carter if not
for the great chemistry between Taylor and Lynn. Loved the movie,
Stanton did an awesome job and for the life of me i cannot figure out
where all the hate is coming from. I hope that time will prove all
those critics wrong, John Carter will make lots of money and sequels
will come sooner rather then later.
