John Carter.. was.. EPIC. <br /><br />I can&#x27;t think of a better word to describe it - you&#x27;ll either love it
or hate it but, unlike just about every other movie that&#x27;s come out in
the past 10 years, this is one you have to see in theaters.<br /><br />Expect a classic story that&#x27;s been inappropriately Disney-fied, expect
a little blockyness in the narrative as a result, expect a tale of
chivalry &#x26; true heroism - elements long since seen in theaters &#x26; expect
a truly vast experience. Interesting characters, amazing sets &#x26; an
original -unique- story. The inspiration for Star Wars, Star Trek &#x26; the
entire sci-fi genre is finally on the big screen - only 100+ years in
the making. <br /><br />Ignore the top critics and go see John Carter at your earliest
convenience!<br /><br />Some language, no nudity &#x26; appropriate romance.<br /><br />Ignore the critics, read the book (you can do so for free at Project
Gutenberg: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62 or audio book:
http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19515), see the movie.
