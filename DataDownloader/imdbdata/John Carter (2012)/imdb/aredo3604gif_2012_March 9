20th Fox and James Cameron employees are in a hurry to kill John Carter
because they just know that if too many people watch it and like it
then Avatar2 and Avatar3 will get in trouble trying to compete with
John Carter sequels that would be produced and released around the same
time.<br /><br />And being an obvious fact that James Cameron copied so much from John
Carter and turned it into the lame Avatar fraud.. they don&#x27;t want John
Carter to succeed. They fear it.<br /><br />So don&#x27;t listen to whoever goes around telling that the movie flopped,
bombed, it&#x27;s a failure and so on. These people want YOU listening to
them to turn it into a failure if YOU follow their wishes and obey to
not watch it and judge it with your own eyes and brain.<br /><br />Just go and watch the movie. The majority of people worldwide won&#x27;t
regret the money spent for sure. But if people don&#x27;t give it a chance
just following competitors wishes to turn this excellent movie into a
financial failure or disappointment.. then the world will have lost the
chance to choose and the ability to watch one of the best sci-fi series
of novels ever written.<br /><br />It would be like negating yourselves the ability to watch Lord Of The
Rings movies just because some competitors producing a worse product
that copied elements out of that gem wanted you to not watch it and
turn it into a financial failure, so the sequels wouldn&#x27;t have been
produced.
