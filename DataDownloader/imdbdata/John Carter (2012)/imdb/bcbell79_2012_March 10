John Carter is a valiant attempt at Edgar Rice Burrough&#x27;s sci-fi
classic The Princess of Mars, but is not the epic film I was hoping
for...Period.<br /><br />I have read The Princess of Mars several times over the years. I love
the book. As one would imagine, I was very excited when I heard that it
was going to be made into a movie. Sadly, this movie has gone through
development hell for close to a decade and perhaps the time took its
toll. In 2004, Paramount owned the rights and Robert Rodriguez (Sin
City) was attached to direct, and then Kerry Conran (Sky Captain and
the World of Tomorrow), and then Jon Favreau (Iron Man). And then,
finally, in 2007 Disney got the rights back and hired on Pixar&#x27;s Andrew
Stanton (WALL-E) to direct this science fiction classic.<br /><br />Stanton&#x27;s vision of Burroughs beloved book is flawed, yet still an
enjoyable film. The film opens on Earth in the 1890&#x27;s. John Carter
(played convincingly by Taylor Kitsch, Friday Night Lights) is a Civil
War Solider who gets chased into a cave by a group of Indians. Here is
where he gets transported to Mars to awaken only to find a race of
green, 12 foot tall, 4-armed aliens known as Thark&#x27;s. John quickly
realizes he has super hero like powers due to Mars&#x27; change in gravity.
He can jump hundreds of feet and has the strength of a dozen men, and
this impresses one of the Thark&#x27;s greatest warriors, Tars Tarkas
(voiced by Willem Dafoe, Boondock Saints).<br /><br />Tarkas brings John back to their alien city, and John starts making
friends (and enemies) quickly. Soon there is complex political story
involving the other &#x27;human-like&#x27; alien race who control most of Mars,
which is where the genuinely beautiful Princess (Lynn Collins, X-Men
Origins: Wolverine) comes in. She is set to marry the villainous Sab
Than (Dominic West, The Wire) but wants nothing to do with him and
eventually falls for our hero, John Carter.<br /><br />One of my favorite characters from the book, Woola (a six legged
creature with dog-like tendencies) who becomes a sort of guardian to
Carter, was a standout character in the film as well! Still, I really
wanted to love this movie... I didn&#x27;t.<br /><br />I was surprised at how many things were changed (seemingly for no real
reason) from book to film. John Carter can still be considered a
faithful adaption, but it could have been better. The visual effects
are absolutely stunning, and perhaps the best reason for seeing this
film on the big screen. They convey a beautiful alien world, and
(animated) characters that interact with the live action flawlessly.
The 3D was also a nice treat. It actually added noticeable depth to the
world of Mars. Unfortunately, I found the movie somewhat slow, and at
times, uninteresting except for the striking visuals. With that said,
the film does have some great action sequences featuring alien on alien
combat.<br /><br />Overall, John Carter is a valiant attempt at Edgar Rice Burrough&#x27;s
sci-fi classic The Princess of Mars, but is not the epic film I was
hoping for. If you have read the book or love sci-fi or big visual
effects movies, it&#x27;s worth checking out on the big screen. Otherwise,
wait for the DVD. I&#x27;m sure it will be out in just a few months!
