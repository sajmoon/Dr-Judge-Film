2012_March 19 
For me a film has to have memorable moments and thinking back.. this
film has none of these- there is no reason to re-visit this title at
all. The creatures look good, the CGI in general looks great but this
doesn&#x27;t go a long way to improve the overall movie experience. It is an
average film, no more, no less.<br /><br />The lead Taylor Kitsch saves the film somewhat. This could springboard
him into many other big films in future. There was some very sketchy
dialogue which he pulled off convincingly well. He has great screen
presence which was utilised well. The supporting actors did a
satisfactory job, the voice actors seemingly doing a better job than
the live actors.<br /><br />Emotionally, the film missed the mark for me. Even with the
&#x27;Lost-esque&#x27; soundtrack I found myself being very emotionally detached
from the film and not caring what happens to any of the characters.<br /><br />The overall look of the film, the Mars location, the aliens.. they all
look good. It does look like another planet. Job well done in that
respect. Where it falls down is the story- nothing out of this world
there. I was expecting something epic, it fell short of my
expectations.
