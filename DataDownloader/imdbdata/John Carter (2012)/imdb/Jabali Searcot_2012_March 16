I was not very excited about the movie because it didn&#x27;t have much to
offer i felt. But once i watched it i was forced to change my opinion.
the movie has a good story and good direction and camera-work. However
the acting and the sound track could do with some improvement. The CGI
was pretty good. The movie lacked something which cannot be defined but
it lacked... It could not completely capture the audience&#x27;s
imagination. Granted it showed mars in a way it was never shown before.
Although it is a long movie, (more than 2 hours) there were not many
boring parts. Overall i would say watch the movie if you have the time.
But its not worth canceling your other appointments for this one.
