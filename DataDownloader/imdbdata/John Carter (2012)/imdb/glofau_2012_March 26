I adore the cheesetastic, pulp-y goodness of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;
classic &#x22;A Princess of Mars.&#x22; Sexist, violent, absurd, imaginative, and
oodles of stupid fun, the story is basically about a
testosterone-dripping he-man who gets magically transported to Mars,
where he discovers that he has super-strength and super-jumping powers
which allow him to wreak havok as the ultimate killing machine while
saving underdogs and damsels in distress in a world of rainbow-colored
aliens with the most improbable names imaginable.<br /><br />At last, digital special effects have reached a point where armies of
four-armed green aliens and fantastical beasts can be realized on the
screen... and they are in this deliciously bad screen adaptation from
one of Pixar&#x27;s most acclaimed screenwriters, Andrew Stanton.<br /><br />Everything about this film oozes prestige and money... and the poor
taste and corporate interference which exemplify the worst of
contemporary Hollywood filmmaking as studios push to create the next
money-making super-franchise. Think Indiana Jones mixed with Eat Drink
Man Woman and Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Cleopatra, with a little Disney&#x27;s
Beauty and the Beast and Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry thrown in for
good measure, and you can appreciate the schizophrenic nature of the
final product.<br /><br />From the opening, incomprehensible prologue, to the pointless
psychological underpinnings of the characters and meaningless, poorly
executed character development, the family-friendly Disney cute
characters juxtaposed with homicidal maniacs and the gorgeous Frank
Frazetta 70&#x27;s fantasy sexploitation design work... all decorating an
almost slavishly faithful realization of the original Burroughs&#x27; source
material which still manages to jettison almost the entirety of the
core original plot, replacing it with something even more
ill-considered and absurd featuring immortal aliens and &#x22;The Ninth
Ray&#x22;... with an epic scope of pageantry and beauty and gorgeous
eye-candy of pulptastic wonderfulness... I was gobsmacked.<br /><br />I literally started giggling uncontrollably at the start of the film,
hooting with derisive laughter, gasping for breath... I laughed for the
entirety of the first 45 minutes without stop, then burst into laughing
fits again and again for at least 90 minutes of the film&#x27;s run time.
Taylor Kitsch&#x27;s John Carter could hardly open his mouth without sending
me into gales of laughter. This film is terribly written, formulaic,
stupid, overly serious, ill-considered, embarrassing... and yet
beautiful, lavish, stunningly animated, gorgeously designed, filled
with authentic pulp-fiction fabulousness and excellent pacing and
incredible effects and cinematography and costumes (the costume
designer should win an Oscar for making those ridiculous
Frazetta-inspired outfits seem so chic and elegant)... There is so much
to enjoy! But be prepared for one of the lamest character stories ever
written, in a film laden with bad decisions and a guiding spirit so
driven to create greatness that he ends up making a film which is
hopelessly ridiculous.<br /><br />I loved this picture... in the spirit of &#x22;Attack of the 50 Foot Woman&#x22;
and the old Flash Gordon serials. It is destined to become one of the
all time great cult films, because it fails on such an epic scale. It
is so entertaining, so delightful, so artistic and sumptuous... and
then you&#x27;re rolling around on the floor, gasping for breath, because
something else has happened which is completely inane, pompous,
formulaic, dreadful. Almost everything on Earth at the beginning of the
film is hopelessly terrible, and once you arrive on Mars... The mistake
was trying to make everything seem real, authentic, truthful, with
everyone so deadly serious all the time; by avoiding camp so ardently
in the midst of this pulp fiction universe, they&#x27;ve created one of the
campiest films of all time! Hilarious! Dreadful! Intoxicating! John
Waters would be proud.
