Recently after trips to the movies I have had this terrible feeling
that someone reached into my back pocket and robbed me of $7. I never
saw the thief&#x27;s face so I couldn&#x27;t report it. Lol. Mostly now I avoid
theaters like the plague. But I had been waiting to see John Carter for
a while so I carved out some time this weekend to go see it. It did not
disappoint.<br /><br />John Carter reminded me of the 80&#x27;s when they still made great
sci-fi/fantasy movies with standout characters and excellent plots. To
me this movie was beyond good. It was great! I am very critical of
movies and a big fan of the genre (sci-fi/fantasy) both in movies and
books. Most of these type movies made in current times fail miserably
because more energy is spent in CGI effects and battle scenes than
building characters, story lines, and worlds that are rich and
believable. You have to have a good balance. Movies now are often
rushed (like Conan the Barbarian and Clash of the Titans) or too long
(like Avatar) and seemingly made for people with attention deficit
disorder (like Jonah Hex). But they got everything right this time in
John Carter. I cannot think of one fault to criticize except it ended.
The actors were all brilliant, the story line and characterizations
were very well done, and the CGI effects were realistic and not
overdone and at the same time stunning.<br /><br />This was a movie I truly enjoyed and would go back to the theaters and
see again. When it ended many people in the theater actually applauded.
I haven&#x27;t seen that in a long while. If you loved the old classics like
Star Wars you will love John Carter. This is the type of movie that
will stand up over time. Please support John Carter so more movies like
this will be made. Let the movie makers know that people still
appreciate a good story and good acting. Bravo Disney! Thanks for a
good time at the movies.
