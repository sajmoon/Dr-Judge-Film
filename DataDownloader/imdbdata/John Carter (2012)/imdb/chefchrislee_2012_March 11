So I in some ways coerced my wife into joining me to see John Carter
Imax 3d just to set the stage. My wife isn&#x27;t a huge scifi fan she
prefers movies that have the word &#x22;poignant&#x22; or &#x22;touching&#x22; somewhere in
the title, and I love her nonetheless. I assured her that if the
director at least followed the books she would enjoy the story. We got
our 3-d glasses, seats, and cozied in for the ride. The movie started
and though it wasn&#x27;t to the &#x22;letter&#x22; in the book (which by the way
would have been unnecessary) It was a GREAT movie. Those who comment on
the lag in the middle must have worse ADD than myself. I felt the
&#x22;political&#x22; fill in was perfect for creating a richer story. Does every
action movie today need to be non-stop explosions, sex and blood? Does
every action movie need to spoon feed the audience the story? To me and
my sweet wife we would both agree that this was a fun, well-scripted,
entertaining movie. There was action, romance, comic moments and plenty
of thrills. The story written so long ago remained intact, I especially
liked the director keeping &#x22;Ned&#x22; in the script. Awesome movie and a
great date!
