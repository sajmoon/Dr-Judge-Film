2012_March 17 
It is a wonderful adventure, science fiction and I think Edgar Rice
Burroughs would be honored (author of the original book). When you take
into consideration that the book was written in 1912 they did an
outstanding job of honoring the intention of the book and making it
work in 2012 as a 3D movie. The 3D and creatures were very well done.
Go see it, let it entertain you and have fun. Leave your critical mind
at the door and then think of all the science fiction that has been
influenced by a book written 100 years ago. <br /><br />I read the original series of books 35 years ago and am so glad they
did not make this movie sooner. Some people think it is like other
science fictions, of course it is for they were influenced by the
original book! <br /><br />It left you with a good ending but they clearly can make the next in
the series as well. You don&#x27;t feel like it was 3 movies cut into
thirds. <br /><br />I recommend seeing this movie and go to have fun. I will see it again
while it is out in 3D.
