I&#x27;ve read a lot of bad reviews on this movie. I honestly think they&#x27;re
unfair. Yes, it was nothing like the book, but if you go into a movie
expecting the book, you&#x27;re almost surely going to be disappointed. I&#x27;ve
read &#x22;A Princess of Mars&#x22;, and I enjoyed it but I have to say I liked
the movie better. A brilliant cast brought the war torn world of
Barsoom to life. The movie was inspired by the book but I didn&#x27;t find
it to be &#x22;A Princess of Mars.&#x22; They took the idea and ran with it. The
result is an entertaining film. From the costumes to the score, I found
this movie to be very well done. A few laughs, cool machines and a
smoking&#x27; hot Taylor Kitsch made this a very enjoyable evening at the
movies.
