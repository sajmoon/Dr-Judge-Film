This fantasy adventure movie has it all - CGI eye candy, boy/girl eye
candy, epic epicness, super-powered higher beings near impossible to
defeat, gorgeous cinematography, effective 3D and some good family
friendly chuckles. I would rank it there with Star Wars Episode 6, and
indeed the storyline and involved parties are somewhat similar to what
happened there (good/bad/natives). This movie was one expensive mother
and you can see every cent of it. Even the 3D is great, without garish
in-your-face effects it just adds another dimension to a dream made
reality by Disney&#x27;s wizards. I really wish them all the best because
I&#x27;d love to see more of the books come to life, but alas, the omens are
not good. Then again, Disney movies traditionally have very strong DVD
sales so there&#x27;s some hope. It&#x27;s an experience you just cannot
reproduce in the same way at home, though, so go see it now!
