This story came out in 1917, before James Cameron, before Star Wars,
before Avatar. All these stories came out AFTER A Princess of Mars.
Before James Cameron, Steven Spielberg and Lucas parents were even
born.<br /><br />They got some of their ideas from Edgar Rice Burroughs, not the other
way around.<br /><br />The film did have some updated ideas to make it a bit more exciting for
younger watchers. I had to think about it for awhile. I did enjoy the
film a lot.<br /><br />My review is kids, read the old science fiction.
