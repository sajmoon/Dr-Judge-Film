Many movies today get a lot of buzz, only to disappoint. Fortunatley,
the buzz around John Carter stood up to the pressure cooker and I
really enjoyed the movie. The story is not one that has never been told
in many other space/love dramedies, but it&#x27;s well-told and left me
wanting more without leaving the story hanging like so many movies do
today.<br /><br />It was cheesy at times, but I think that must have been on purpose
because almost all of the cheesiness got a laugh from the audience. All
in all, I really enjoyed John Carter and Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins
both exceeded my expectations.
