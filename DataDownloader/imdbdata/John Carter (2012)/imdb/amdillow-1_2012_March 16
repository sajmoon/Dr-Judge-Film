If you truly want to create an epic movie a very good place to start is
a classic science fiction masterpiece like ER Burroughs &#x22;The princess
of Mars&#x22; AKA John Carter.<br /><br />With more than enough action and special effects to make any SF fan
happy and enough comedy packed into it to make the kids and the wife
lol to. Top the movie off with a fantastic script written by Buzz
Lightyears father Andrew Stanton and you have IMO an epic movie worth
watching and buying on Blu-Ray when it comes out too.<br /><br />Great Job Disney and Andrew Stanton I hope more of the epic series is
coming.
