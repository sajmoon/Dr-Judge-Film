John carter has got to be one of the visual spectacles of 2012, with
much of it&#x27;s combat scenes being reminiscent of Star Wars (a franchise
that came long after the original &#x22;Barsoom&#x22; series was first published)
However John Carter is a able to to such scenes in it&#x27;s own unique way
so that though they resemble what Lucas did later in the 70s, it
creates creatures, Cultures and Airships that only the people of Mars
could have dreamed off from hulking White Apes to an imaginative
mash-up of Traditional bladed weaponry of the ancient past and Sci-fi
technologies.<br /><br />The film takes a while to get going (Such as the firsts scenes with
Carter on earth) but once he gets to Mars I can assure you you will
regret nothing because the Filmprovides us with a more fascinating
mythos than Avatar&#x27;s.<br /><br />The plot is decent to an extent but is pushed along effortlessly by the
amount of talent that&#x27;s involved in the performances regardless of
whenever it&#x27;s a savage Thark or Taylor KItsch as He-man (I therefore
look forward to seeing him in &#x22;Battleship&#x22; when it finally hits land)
Did I mention that Edgar Rice Burroghs himself his more or less
involved in the beginning and end of the story. I wont say any more for
fear of spoilers but I will say it is all really interesting that he
appears in the film himself even though the &#x22;The Raven&#x22; has done
similar thing this year.
