I was really looking forward to this movie, I&#x27;m a huge science fiction
fan, but it ended up being a non-stop CGI borefest with a high cheese
factor and seems like it was intended for kids, not adults. I guess the
Disney studio should have been a tip-off. The main hero is not
interesting at all, non-charismatic, don&#x27;t know where they got this guy
from, but he was a total void in the role. The other actors don&#x27;t fare
much better, the limited number of human actors I should say, because a
large percentage of the time the movie is featuring aliens who look
like pseudo-lizards with terrible CGI effects that make them appear
almost like a cartoon. If you loved Jar Jar Binks from the awful Star
Wars prequels then you should love these deeply silly and dumb looking
CGI dino-aliens.<br /><br />The story is an incoherent mess, and not even interesting enough to
want to attempt to follow the plot. Action scenes are blah as well,
with excessive and fake looking CGI again taking over. I can&#x27;t
recommend this movie unless you are taking pre-teen kids to it, they
might like it, but anyone else steer clear.
