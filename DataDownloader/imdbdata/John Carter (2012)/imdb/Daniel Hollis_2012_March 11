For films such as John Carter, you have to accept them for what they
are. Unfortunately John Carter fails on the aspects it hopes to appeal
too. Based on the 1917 book &#x27;A Princess Of Mars&#x27; written by Edgar Rice
Burroughs it stars up and coming actor Taylor Kitsch as John Carter
himself, a civil war veteran who is mysteriously transported to Mars
and quickly involved in an on going war that the planet faces.<br /><br />Coming straight from directing animated Pixar films such as &#x27;Finding
Nemo&#x27; and &#x27;Wall-E&#x27; Andrew Stanton hasn&#x27;t quite grasped how to deal with
a live action film. Mars is host to a wide array of human-esque
characters and a large amount of CGI aliens known as the Thark. Through
his directing he appears to have given the effects more life and
personality than any of the human counterparts, which remain fairly
flat and unremarkable. This makes around half of the film fairly
interesting while the other half lies flat and dormant. Kitsch tries
his hardest to bring himself as a charismatic and relatable character
but the dreary cast keeps him back. Dominic West poses as a bland
villain along side Mark Strong who demonstrated in &#x27;Tinker Tailor
Solider Spy&#x27; that he can be a highly qualified actor when given the
right role.<br /><br />The acting isn&#x27;t the only problem here. The plot has a lot of meat to
it but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s in anyway interesting. It meanders
and drags switching between all the various different factions and with
the human characters being as plain as they are it makes their scenes
extremely un-engaging. For those who haven&#x27;t read the book the story
will feel like it&#x27;s swaying all around the place. An unnecessary plot
line involving Carters nephew on Earth feels completely out of place
and only features at the very beginning and the very end meaning that
half way on through the time on Mars you will have forgotten all about
it making the ending not as satisfying as it should have been. A forced
romance plot line weaves its way through the plot as well that makes
for some truly awkward and wooden acting between Kitsch and Lynn
Collins who plays the Princess of one of Mars cities known as Helium.
The only strand of the film that is somewhat compelling is the
involvement with Thark&#x27;s where again Stanton demonstrates he&#x27;s best
suited with animation.<br /><br />A Princess Of Mars heavily influenced many science fiction films that
exist today, without Burroughs books there wouldn&#x27;t be films such as
&#x27;Star Wars&#x27;, &#x27;Avatar&#x27; or &#x27;Stargate&#x27;. The only problem is the film is
now in a world where said films do exist so it makes a hard time for
the audience not to compare it to such films. The desert planet is
reminiscent of Tatooine from &#x27;Star Wars&#x27;, the Thark resemble the
civilization from &#x27;Avatar&#x27; and the soundtrack boasts that of the
original &#x27;Stargate&#x27; film. The fact that these films have happened makes
John Carter all the more pointless for existing. Its time has passed
and as a result won&#x27;t flow as well in this day and age.<br /><br />That being said there are things to like about John Carter. The first
portion of Mars is entertaining as Carter attempts to get used to the
environment and the species on the planet. It builds for some genuine
interest and excitement. But as soon as the rest of the cast is
introduced, unfortunately spirals downhill. Another positive factor is
the set pieces. Because they are so far apart they provide a refreshing
change of pace. There&#x27;s a particular standout scene in which Carter is
fighting an array of enemies but the film also cuts back to a previous
part of his life on Earth, interchanging between the two scenes.
Unfortunately though these positives don&#x27;t bring cause for a
recommendation to see John Carter. It&#x27;s bland, slow, boring and has a
thick and overflowing plot that won&#x27;t appeal to a large variety of the
audience. The book was way ahead of its time, the film however is not.
