I once read somewhere there are only seven stories to tell. By changing
details like characters , environment , sequence of events and editing
you can make them different or look like original ( and be successful )
But at the end there are just seven stories to tell. John Carter is a
prime example of this.<br /><br />Plot is simple and familiar since the days of simple fairy tale era :(
though it is understandable , we are talking about 100 year old sci-fi
fantasy novel written by Edgar R. Burroughs as original story material
I admit that it is nicely paced and edited.) The protagonist John
Carter , a US Civil War veteran , a man robbed of his life purpose ,
suddenly finds himself in Mars of past...a long lost era when Red
Planet was sustainable of life. Here with incredible jumping
capabilities and physical powers he becomes a hero , a legend fighting
on the side of good Helium city against evil Zadonga city , hooking up
with a Princess needed to be saved , becomes buddies with six foot CGI
Gungan like creatures from Star Wars etc.....<br /><br />In this era when virtual video games became more complicated and
scripted like real stage plays or movie scripts themselves and movies
became more and more like video games , John Carter relies more on
visual effects , CGI and 3D as expected in the absence of original
writing material. They are not bad but just like the story itself they
are all in &#x22;we have seen that before&#x22; territory. In outdoor decors
,fashion , style and writing it is all like Star Wars Episode I ,
Prince of Persia , Avatar , Flash Gordon , TV series Rome 2005 ( it
even has three Rome actors in similar roles ) and Farscape combined. It
is not bad but as I said before , it is too FAMILIAR...<br /><br />As for acting although Taylor Kitsch did not impress me as regular
young white muscled long haired handsome hero , rest of the cast was
not bad. Lynn Collins was OK , from supporting actors Mark Strong was
quite good as expected from his theater trained career. So were other
live action actors like great Ciaran Hinds , Dominic West and James
Purefloy with their limited screen time. Other decent actors like
Samantha Morton , Polly Walker , Willem Defoe and Thomas Haden Church
provide nice voice acting for Tarks if nothing else.<br /><br />John Carter of Mars is not a bad movie. It is enjoyable , enough to
waste a couple hours. Kids will probably like it. One thing it would
not be though. It won&#x27;t be a franchise , something Disney longed to
replace dying Pirates of Caribbean series. It is just too unoriginal
and mediocre for that. Era of Eroll Flynn heroics are long past...
