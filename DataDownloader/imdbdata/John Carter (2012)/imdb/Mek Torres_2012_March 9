John Carter is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; novel that inspires most
sci-fi fantasy films. It&#x27;s about time to make an adaptation of it. We
may have seen some of its elements before but we still get to see some
great innovations from its visuals. This is also Andrew Stanton&#x27;s first
live-action movie and he poured his heart and soul in this one. The
editing paces too quickly in some parts but that didn&#x27;t harm the
wonders of this relic. John Carter is big and amazingly exciting.<br /><br />We don&#x27;t get to see a lot of new things here. Star Wars and Avatar have
already got the story&#x27;s innovations to the big screen. By the way, this
story comes first before those sci-fi movies. The storytelling is
straightforward. Though, it had some weak introduction. In some parts,
the editing paces too quick. It&#x27;s kind of awkward. Especially in one
scene when John Carter was about to challenge a Thark. It was suppose
to be awesome or but it turns out to be unintentionally hilarious.
Again, it didn&#x27;t affect the wonders of this film.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch isn&#x27;t much of a great actor but he works better in action
scenes. Making the jumping and fighting look exciting. Lynn Collins is
good enough as the Princess. Ciar&#xE1;n Hinds is always a fine actor. Mark
Strong does his typical villain performance which it&#x27;s still effective.
The best goes to Willem Dafoe. He manages to give a lot of depth to his
character.<br /><br />The visuals are largely wonderful makes this experience much more
exciting. There are plenty of fascinating character designs and places.
The dog-like-creature is the character design that intrigues me most. I
mean seriously, it looks great. Michael Giacchino&#x27;s music is always
classy to adventure movies. The action is exciting enough and large
enough. The 3D looks converted but I don&#x27;t know. Didn&#x27;t notice anything
coming out the screen but the title cards and the Disney logo.<br /><br />John Carter is totally a great cinematic experience. The story may not
sound new to the cinema, but hey, it&#x27;s a relic. We can still see
something intriguing and fascinating. This film is just a reminder how
Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; classic inspired most sci-fi fantasy epics. The
point is just bringing this to life, give a lot of magic, and fun to
this story. It&#x27;s simply a big fun film.
