Not gonna write an essay and bore you with endless words, so all i will
say is that John Carter tries so so hard to be this epic blockbuster
and just fails to bring what the massive budget was spent on. All this
film brings you is over the top effects,costumes that are to fancy a
world that is dull and makes no sense a story which copies every other
and feels bland and soulless,and a main lead on who you just don&#x27;t care
about. Unlike avatar which gave somewhat the same feel it was the story
and history of the world and the people which really drove the film,
john carters main drive was special effects which as we all know except
Hollywood is that special computer effects does not equal great film.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Family fun thats to big for its own boots don&#x27;t expect an avatar type
movie don&#x27;t watch this in 3D its crap and you wont even notice it. kids
will enjoy it as they are stupid adults should hate it as they should
know better in fact, wait till its on DVD there&#x27;s nothing to miss at
the cinema.
