John Carter is, at its core, a copy and paste remake of several movies.
Take a large glob of Avatar. Add in a dressing of Batman Begins.
Finally, season it with Diego. Although this movie was enjoyable, it
faked its imagination&#x97;the one thing it going for it with the director
and screenwriter of WALL-E on the case. Add in some lackluster
dialogue, and John Carter is pretty much a window dressing. Pretty on
the outside. Nothing on the inside.<br /><br />The window dressing, I must admit, is quite fancy. The animation that
created the aliens and the cities on Mars is extremely well done.
Putting in strange animations&#x97;like the dog&#x97;only add to the glamor. It
even helps move the storyline forward at times. Just like with Avatar,
the scenes between aliens and humans provides for plenty of intrigue.<br /><br />At the heart of John Carter, however, is a major problem. The main idea
is that a human on Mars will have super-human power because of the
gravitational change and skeletal structure. Although the idea has
merit, it is horribly executed. An earthling may be able to jump a few
more feet and throw further. As the movie progresses, however, the
awkwardness that John Carter initially experiences is all but
forgotten&#x97; replaced by an absurd exaggeration of his abilities.<br /><br />The decision to place this movie in the second half of the 1800s is
questionable. I know they had to do it to avoid the whole idea of space
exploration and human&#x27;s realization that there actually isn&#x27;t life on
Mars. When the movie began, this aspect was intriguing. How would they
explain that Mars doesn&#x27;t have life when we send our probes only 100
years later? Well, my question was never answered. On this front, John
Carter decided to take a rain check.<br /><br />John Carter is enjoyable. If you have a kid who wants to go, they will
enjoy it. Just don&#x27;t expect much behind the curtains. You will get a
storyline that you have seen before. You will have actors that cannot
handle the job they have been given. You will have an idea that could
have been great, but fell horribly short. We are still waiting for the
first decent children&#x27;s flick of 2012.<br /><br />reillyreviews.wordpress.com
