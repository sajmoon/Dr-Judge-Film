&#x22;Before &#x27;Star Wars&#x27;....before &#x27;Avatar&#x27;....there was...John Carter.&#x22;
Yeah, um, referring to those two films in the same breath as &#x22;John
Carter&#x22; is a huge misnomer. &#x22;John Carter&#x22; is nowhere close to the same
league.<br /><br />Not even remotely.<br /><br />Not to say the film isn&#x27;t entertaining. The story of, um, well, John
Carter is that of a military captain who gets transported from the
1800s to Mars where he has extraordinary physical prowess and gets
caught between a war going on between the inhabitants of the planet,
and, of course, coming off as the hero.<br /><br />However, despite the cool visuals, especially when viewed on IMAX 3D,
and Taylor Kitsch&#x27;s incredibly beautiful and always half-naked body,
the film itself is just a wee bit TOO Disney and ultimately pretty
forgettable. It rolls along with a good enough pace, and the inclusion
of Willem Defoe and Thomas Haden Church in alien roles that render them
unrecognizable is pretty cool, but really the only thing I truly took
from this film is, um, yep...Kitsch has one hot body.<br /><br />A number of reviews have mentioned the fact that Kitsch ended up being
to &#x22;pretty&#x22; for the role and I could not even begin to understand how
anyone could make that statement. Until I saw the film. Yes, somehow,
Kitsch indeed was just too pretty for the role. His looks and
musculature overtook every scene he was in and rendered him otherwise
shallow. With no chemistry at all between him and anyone else in the
film, it was hard to take anything going on on screen seriously, and
the end product really is just a shallow, meaningless fluff film that
will not do much than push Kitsch&#x27;s sex-symbol image further.<br /><br />If this is the Year of the Kitsch, I guess we&#x27;ll have to see what he
does in &#x22;Battleship&#x22; and Oliver Stone&#x27;s &#x22;Savages&#x22; before we can see if
he has been worth the investment. However, if a movie will show off his
best assets, you can assume I&#x27;ll find my way to the theatre.
