I can&#x27;t believe all the negative reviews...this on-slot against this
movie bothered me so much I decided to write my own to let Sci-Fi fans
know how good this movie is. I haven&#x27;t been as excited about a movie
since the opening of Star Wars. The characters are all likable. The
story is true to the John Carter books. The unique early 20th story
telling and ideas and imagination of Mars for the period are fresh. I
liked that the story assumes the watcher knows whats going on without
having to explain too much and just let the movie guide the watcher on.
Lots of fun and excitement without having current political ideals pop
into the story. It is Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; epic tale come to the big
screen...and its about time. My daughter and I are going back to see it
again. I will get the Blu-ray version when it comes out. I got so
excited I had to go look up Frank Franzetta&#x27;s old art to compare to the
movie...I highly recommend this film.
