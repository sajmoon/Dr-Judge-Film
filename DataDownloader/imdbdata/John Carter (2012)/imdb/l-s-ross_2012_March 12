With the fantasy and sci-fi that has been out in the last couple years
I certainly didn&#x27;t have my hopes up too high for this film. Was I ever
surprised. It was such a pleasure to watch and so very entertaining.
The acting was very good. The storyline was unusual and exciting. The
computer graphics were grade &#x22;A&#x22; and it was just fun! I&#x27;m sure you have
read previous reviews and by now have the story line so I don&#x27;t need to
go into that. Let&#x27;s just say that if you see any movie this year, this
is one you should definitely see. I know that as soon as it comes out
on DVD, I will be buying it! Don&#x27;t be disenchanted by the not so
stellar turn out in its opening week, this movie will be around for a
while and make lots of money.
