I was not sure what to expect with John Carter, but I was pleasantly
surprised on how good it was. I have always been into all kinds of film
and don&#x27;t have a preference, so I watched the movie with an open mind
and no expectations. <br /><br />After seeing this vivid and action packed movie about another planet, I
was amazed at the lack of publicity Disney gave it. Unlike AVATAR&#x27;S on
going hype, I heard nothing about the details of the movie, it&#x27;s making
and it&#x27;s story. But after seeing it I recommend it to any one. <br /><br />With the lack of publicity Disney gave it, I am not sure how they are
going to make back 250 Million dollars, but I guess they are hoping
that word of mouth will get around and bring people to see it. <br /><br />So if you are into fantasy, scifi and action films... go see it! It was
wonderful.
