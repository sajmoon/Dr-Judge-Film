So, as a fan of Burroughs I went to see this movie. The biggest problem
is that it does not really follow the book, but on the other hand all
the stuff in the movie appears in other Burroughs books.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t like the holy Therns, since they do not appear in the book &#x22;A
princess of Mars&#x22; but then again they are apparently some kind of mix
of Therns in &#x22;Gods of Mars&#x22; ans Lotharian therns from the book &#x22;Thuvia,
Maid of Mars&#x22; a masters of suggestion, not a master of shape-shifting
that X-men generation might misinterpret them.<br /><br />When looking this movie I could not wonder how much Lucas and Cameron
stole from this story, Star wars stole so many words (Jed, Sith,
Padwar, Banth, Woola and so on) + the idea of noble man fighting with
sword even tho they have laser weapons, and saving princess + Tatooine
desert and so on, it it obvious that Lucas read Burroughs, no matter
how much he denies it, it would be the most unbelievable coincidence
ever if he have come up with all of these without reading Burroughs.<br /><br />Stanton also makes one nice inside joke, he has taken one scene from a
book &#x22;Tarzan the untamed&#x22;, anyone who don&#x27;t know could be fooled that
this scene is copied from the original -76 Star wars movie. But the
pictures shows that this is a part of Tarzan story, not John Carter.<br /><br />Anyway, the film is enjoyable, even when it does not follow the book.
And it makes you wonder how little space-opera has changed in the last
100 years. After all, this film does not stole story lines from anyone
else than Burroughs himself, and still there are many familiar themes.
Someone stole from someone, but the criminal wasn&#x27;t Burroughs or John
Carter.
