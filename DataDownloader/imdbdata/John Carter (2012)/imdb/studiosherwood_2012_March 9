I saw a preview in 3D and can easily recommend this film, especially to
all fantasy adventure film lovers. It is one of the most beautiful
films I have seen in this genre and though I read the book a long time
ago when I was in my teens, it seems that Stanton has done an excellent
job of bringing the story to life and improving on the character of the
Princess. It is a great adventure story. I was not familiar with either
of the two leads, but they were both great and bring the love story
real sizzle. And then all my favorite actors from HBO are here in
supporting roles, so no complaints. This is a family friendly film,
that an adult will get as much out of as the kids, so in that regard it
is like Stanton&#x27;s films at Pixar. And like Avatar, it brings an
important message to the fore that becomes the hero&#x27;s quest, but not
before earning your involvement, too. The whole adventure left me
hungering for more from the Princess of Mars!
