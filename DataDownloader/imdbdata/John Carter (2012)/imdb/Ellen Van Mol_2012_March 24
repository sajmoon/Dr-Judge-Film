This was an incredible film!!! I don&#x27;t understand how this film can
turn out to be a budget disaster. I saw it last week and was really
overwhelmed. It&#x27;s one of the best in his genre.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning, Andrew Stanton really proves what he&#x27;s worth.
And Taylor Kitsch puts down a brilliant performance. He gives so much
depth to John Carter. He has a great flair that makes young and old
believe his character. It&#x27;s a brilliant adaptation of the Rice
Burrough&#x27;s books and I can&#x27;t wait to see the sequel. Critics say it&#x27;s a
lame story but that is absolutely wrong. It has an intriguing plot with
a very interesting storyline. A visual spectacle with an amazing story
behind it and some pretty awesome actors.
