I saw it opening weekend and believe me, this old fan-boy wanted to
like it. It&#x27;s not so much that the film has a Romans in space feel to
it (what with the togas and the shiny helmets) but what seems to have
been lost in all the reviews I&#x27;ve read is that the film is not faithful
to Burroughs original novel. And by &#x22;not faithful&#x22; I mean it really
went its own way. It has about as much connection to the original story
as Tim Burton&#x27;s Alice in Wonderland had to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s original
novel. It&#x27;s hard to understand why filmmakers feel the need to change a
story so much, especially when the changes contribute nothing. Why not
just invent your own story and save yourself the hassle? This film is
likely to make fans of Burroughs classic sci-fi tale grind their teeth.
It has some cool FX. But all the special effects in the world can&#x27;t
rescue a film that&#x27;s unevenly paced with acting that wavers between
engaged and adequate at best. The battle scenes are fun. The jumping
sequences are over the top. Some work, some look pretty fakey. It&#x27;s
hard to know where they put all that $250 million. It feels like the
film was rushed into production before a good script was ready. It&#x27;s
not altogether a terrible sci-fi film but in ten years it&#x27;s going to
look pretty stupid. Maybe if Stanton had stuck to Burroughs&#x27; original
tale this film wouldn&#x27;t be tottering on eight legs.
