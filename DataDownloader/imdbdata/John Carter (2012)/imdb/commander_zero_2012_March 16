2012_March 16 
I became familiar, very familiar, with Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &#x22;John
Carter&#x22; series in its Ballantine Books editions in the 1960s, and years
later I read the first few books in the series to my sons over a number
of bedtimes. <br /><br />Back in the sixties, I wondered what they would be like as films, and
knew that they were far beyond the technical capabilities of that era&#x27;s
cinema&#x97;although if in the 1960s, a studio had decided to commit the
1960s equivalent of &#x22;John Carter&#x27;s&#x22; enormous budget to such a project,
it would have paid for an awful lot of models and stop-motion
animation.<br /><br />At any rate, &#x22;John Carter,&#x22; an adaptation of the first novel in
Burroughs&#x27; series, A Princess of Mars, has been produced with an
enormous budget and treated with the respect it deserves. In fact,
probably more respect than it deserves, but I&#x27;ll get to that shortly.<br /><br />The &#x22;John Carter&#x22; books were mass market fiction&#x97;none of them were very
long, and this film&#x27;s main defect is that the plot of &#x22;Princess,&#x22; such
as I remember it, has been extended and complicated. Some of the
effects of this are good: for example, an added backstory now makes the
hero&#x27;s sudden teleportation to Mars, return and death, or non-death
make perfect sense (in the books it was always a bit of a
head-scratcher), within a concept slightly expanded from the books. <br /><br />So, as with most epics (and I write this as someone who&#x27;s never been
able to sit through any of the &#x22;Lord of the Rings&#x22; trilogy, and thinks
all the Sam Raimi &#x22;Spiderman&#x22; films would benefit from tighter editing)
there is simply too much. The whole thern/Sab Than (bad guy)
relationship is a bit puzzling&#x97;who are the therns anyway, and why do
they need him?&#x97;and late in the film, when Kantos Kan appears&#x97;in the
books he is Carter&#x27;s friend, and in the film he should have stuck
around longer&#x97;he (James Purefoy) so resembles Sab Than (Dominic West)
that there are moments of confusion just when the action is at its
height.<br /><br />In fact, there is a whole alien world the filmmakers have to make
comprehensible to us, and they have chosen to extend and complicate at
times when it would have been better to compress and simplify. It&#x27;s not
as if Burroughs necessarily wrote wonderful plots&#x97;he was a pulp writer,
and although the first books in any of his series, including &#x22;Tarzan,&#x22;
were imaginative and well thought-out, one could soon tell that in
subsequent novels he would just sit down at his manual typewriter and
wing it.<br /><br />What should have been complicated are the relationships at stake. The
good guy who arrives among savages, wins their respect, and galvanizes
them to storm the castle and save the beautiful princess&#x97; these are
hoary clich&#xE9;s that the cinema audience has seen endlessly, most
recently in &#x22;Avatar.&#x22; Now here&#x27;s an aspect of the film that could have
used complicating. If the therns can travel from planet to planet,
shouldn&#x27;t John Carter be tempted to ally himself with them? Is the
feisty and combative Deja Thoris really so ready to trade a planetful
of princes for this pale-skinned foreigner? And what about that long
voyage to the sacred island&#x97;didn&#x27;t that merely supply exposition that
could have been provided in a few sentences?<br /><br />That said, this could be the best-LOOKING film I&#x27;ve ever seen. Not only
in the extravagant and amazing special effects, but in the colour
schemes, costume and set design. The acting is good, the humour works,
and the longish preamble, which includes Victorian London and the Wild
West, doesn&#x27;t seem too long. Now, if there had just been a bit more
editing&#x85;
