Even though, some scenes are quite Star Wars-iesque, it is a truly
great movie.In short, it is an exciting Sci Fi adventure/fantasy with
all the elements a good Sci-fi should have. <br /><br />Firstly, I&#x27;d prefer this one before Star Wars (SW) any day. However, as
mentioned in the other reviews the trailers are quite unrepresentative
and do not really represent the movie at all. <br /><br />Subsequently, the script could at times be more intelligent and you can
see that some scenes are inspired by SW &#x22;the clone wars&#x22;. However, this
is what Disney should be all about. Even me that hated lord of the
rings, Star Wars episode 3 and Avatar thought this one actually did the
job. CGI is among one of the best I seen even better than the prequel
SW movies and, yes you guessed right, Avatar. <br /><br />I even would like to see a sequel obviously Stanton knows what he is
doing and there are still eleven books to go in the series.<br /><br />MY MESSAGE IS THIS: THE TRAILER IS BAD, THE MOVIE IS GREAT, SEE IT IN
D-BOX 3D AND I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. <br /><br />And for all the haters, if you liked avatar and thought that was a good
movie, than I do not see how you can hate this movie with good
consciousness. <br /><br />All the best,
