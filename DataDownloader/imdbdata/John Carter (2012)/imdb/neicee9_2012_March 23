The movie was excellent, with excellent acting and special effects. It
was so good that I purchased the entire 11 book series and am reading
it. I really hope this series takes off and we get to see more of John
Carter (and the same cast). I did wish that the aliens represented
(visually) more of the actors that portrayed them, but it did not
detract from the movie. It is a little hard to understand at the
beginning, but by the middle of the movie you are able to understand
about the three groups on Mars. Talor Kitsch and Lynn Collins are
excellent in their parts, and I loved the fact that a princess could be
a scientist instead of a screaming damsel in distress. I found this
much better than Avatar.
