2012_March 12 
First of all, if i hadn&#x27;t read the reviews on IMDb i would mostly gave
this movie at least an 8 but because most of the reviews were
describing this movie as Avatar of 2012 or the new star wars and some
stated its a combination of the best of both star wars and avatar. i
went to see it with high expectations but i was so disappointed this
movie is no where near avatar nor star wars. yes its a combination of
both but not as good not even close. so piece of advice don&#x27;t have high
hopes this is one of the movies where in order to enjoy you shouldn&#x27;t
read the reviews. still it will be a block buster nevertheless.enjoy
the movie and tell me what do you think
