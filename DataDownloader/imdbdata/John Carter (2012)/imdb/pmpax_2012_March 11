Just came back from seeing the film...and I must say that I really
enjoyed it tremendously! <br /><br />It brought me back to when I was a young kid and would go to the movies
with my father. It is an old school adventure film from when movies
were made with passion and real care. <br /><br />The director Andrew Stanton really crafted this movie with a lot of
love and you can tell that he really holds the John Carter character
dear. They did a great job and I hope it does well enough so that we
get to see more JC films.<br /><br />I highly recommend seeing this film!
