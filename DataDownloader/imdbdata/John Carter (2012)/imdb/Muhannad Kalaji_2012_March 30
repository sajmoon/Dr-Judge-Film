give me a break will you all this huge production, big action scenes,
all the publicity, Walt Disney pictures... all that failed to offer a
good movie<br /><br />am sorry to say that this movie is nothing but a punch of good ideas...
but that&#x27;s all it is i mean they have came up with some good ideas but
failed to connect the dots between those totally,<br /><br />and i couldn&#x27;t help feeling that there are a lot of things &#x22;borrowed&#x22;
from star wars... yes especially that arena execution scene !! not to
mention the clan of natives<br /><br />they failed to offer good spark between the John carter and the girl i
mean they did not click and the way that the director takes us from one
scene to another is just not convincing and the way that he threw that
key he had away... why did he do that? there is not enough background
for this<br /><br />i thought this movie is sooo commercial and has no depth at all, i
could not like the director here, not that i didn&#x27;t try and all but was
a difficult task liking this movie<br /><br />i think this is what these days movies are just a punch of ideas thrown
at you, no body cares about the story any more, the movie is just a
punch of graphics (which are not so original as i mentioned earlier)
