Let me start off by saying that I had not read any reviews or heard
anything about this movie except what I saw in the trailers. It simply
looked like a good action movie and I wanted to see it.<br /><br />Little did I know what a breathtaking, entertaining, and wondrous epic
movie this was going to be. Think of Star Wars with Avatar. I actually
enjoyed it better than Avatar since it didn&#x27;t contain all that
political preaching. This simply is a great action sci-fi movie that
should become a new classic.<br /><br />Disney did an outstanding job with this movie since the plot, special
effects, and action scenes were outstanding.<br /><br />Basic plot: John Carter is somehow transported to Mars and acquires
super human powers due to Mars&#x27; gravity (i.e. like Superman). While
there, he gets caught up in a war between the Martians (who in turn are
being manipulated by beings that act and resemble the ancient Greek
gods). Along the way, our hero falls in love with a Martian princess
who, in turn, is trying to save her people.<br /><br />In short, if you really enjoy sci-fi movies, then don&#x27;t miss this one.<br /><br />I really hope there&#x27;s a sequel!
