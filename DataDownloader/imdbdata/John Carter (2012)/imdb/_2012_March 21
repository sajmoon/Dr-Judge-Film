Several weeks ago I saw a trailer for a science fiction flic called
John Carter. All that was shown was a virtually unknown cast(which I
love when done right), a pretty red -skinned girl that was obviously
wearing a ton of make-up on that wasn&#x27;t explained, a man throwing
people around as if they were light as a feather, some flying ships,
something about Mars, and some green skinned aliens with 4 arms. The
movie that was depicted in this $250 million budgeted blockbuster&#x27;s
trailer was that of something you go out of your way to avoid and
dislike without ever giving it a try, or seeing it.<br /><br />The fact is, this movie is nothing like the badly put together trailers
for it. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time being fed
little by little an amazing journey with a storyline, plot, universe,
and characters to not just rival Avatar, but to top it. You are drawn
in through a historical yet science fiction 19th century atmosphere
that has you questioning if your in the right movie or not. The
flashbacks and pre-setups that take place from everything to the
current timeline of the story to the main characters previous family
keep you interested, intrigued, and not able to predict some linear
obvious plot like today&#x27;s movies normally do. The main storyline
continues to entice all the way through till what seems to be an ending
to the main plot and a temporary but happy ending to the romantic
subplot.<br /><br />Romance, no matter how many people try to deny it, makes or brakes a
movie. The cast involved, the emotional levels, the depth or lack of
depth involved, the accurate gestures, the dialogue, etc. lays the
foundation for the plot. John Carter&#x27;s romance provides a perfect
mixture of mystery, fueds, drama, and just the right amount of screen
time to make the actual plot believable and interactive.<br /><br />Being a part of the technological generation that has strayed away from
reading and more towards social networking, television, and movies is
almost a curse. I had never heard of the amazing book franchise that
sparked this motion pictures creation and funded the breathtaking world
that is John Carter. I intend to read the first books I haven&#x27;t had to
read for college in the next couple months, and they will be the novels
that inspired John Carter.<br /><br />John Carter deserves more than just a sequel, and I believe 90% of the
science fiction fans who have actually seen the movie and not the
trailers or negative reviews know this. Nothing else can be said
besides the marketing FAIL on behalf of Disney or if the director
really was solo&#x27;ly responsible for the advertisement. Anyone with a
brain can tell there a significant market for science fiction in this
messed up world we live in with a disappearing middle class and a
growing instability in governments. Disney would be out of their minds
to not introduce a new commercial or last minute advertisement campaign
and attempt to gain a larger gross from the weeks John Carter still has
in theatres and the DVD release.<br /><br />10/10 and replaces Avatar in my mind as the most interesting fantasy
universe I have yet to come across and would like more of. I will
continue to spread the word of what a real movie should look like, like
John Carter.
