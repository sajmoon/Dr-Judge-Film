2012_March 9 
Saw the trailer of this movie and thought WOW!, got to check this out.
went to the movies , the second show of the day . When the movie starts
I am faced with a dilemma, is this the same movie I wanted to watch?
The movie starts pretty slow but gets interesting as we go on. The
effects are pretty good, but the 3d is just average , didn&#x27;t have many
in your face effects. the picture was pretty dark and gave me a
headache after the intermission. The story offers lot of potential, but
needs some understanding. Action is great but few and far between I
felt. Expected to be lifted off my seat with the action but was
disappointed. The actors did their bit , really liked the lead lady,
gorgeous she is in the face department, the body a little manly for my
taste. There is a twist in the end , nothing too fantastic. I really
hope there isn&#x27;t part 2. I will try never again to watch a 3d movie. I
found the one minute trailer of MIB 3 more interesting truly speaking.
want a Luke warm headache and if you feel you purse is heavy , please
watch it. your world won&#x27;t change if you don&#x27;t or do.
