Firstly, this movie certainly isn&#x27;t a ground-breaker in terms of plot
or special effects - although the special effects are amazing! What it
does successfully is masterfully combining all the elements of the most
legendary adventure &#x26; sci-films of all time: Star Wars, Indiana Jones,
Avatar, Pirates Of The Carribbean, and Dune to bring us an edge of your
seat piece of entertainment. While the main-plot itself is nothing new,
in fact written nearly 100 years ago, the eye-popping visualizations,
and unique plot twists make this movie a thrill-ride from start to
finish. It certainly kept me engaged, and even though you know the good
guys are going to win - there are enough plot twists and comedic
interludes to keep you guessing as to what comes next. This film is a
&#x22;sleeper&#x22; - in that from all the hype and outward appearances it may
seem like a re-hash of old... but definitely it is much more than that,
and is destined to be one of the &#x22;greats&#x22; and &#x22;must see&#x22; films of the
year. There is no question, put John Carter 3D on your bucket list for
things to do this Spring Break and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!
