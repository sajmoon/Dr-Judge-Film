This movie felt like all these story ideas were written down on
separate post-it notes, thrown on the floor and then strung together
with tiny, tiny bits of bluetac on a dusty wall. Hmmm what worries me
the most is that Andrew Stanton is an animation director moving into
live action, and this is an example of an &#x27;Epic&#x27; failure. Then again
live action directors do not do much better when moving into animated
films. This movie felt like it had no story-reel; an essential part of
the animated film process. There were so many story holes and
unresolved ideas that the movie it should never have left the
storyboard room. Sad.
