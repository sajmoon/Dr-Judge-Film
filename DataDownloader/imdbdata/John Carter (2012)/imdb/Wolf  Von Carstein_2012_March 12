Just saw this film, and could hardly wait to review it. IGNORE THE
CRITICS! This is far and away the best adventure movie to appear since
the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which collectively are its only peers of
the last twenty years. Disney&#x27;s previews do not do it justice. If you
are a fan of action films in general, and of swashbucklers in
particular, go see this film. TWICE! Disney&#x27;s ham-handed treatment of
its publicity may strangle a potential blockbuster series in its crib,
so check it out. The general feel is loyal to Edgar Rice Burroughs
&#x22;Mars&#x22; series, but not slavishly so. While there is some violence,
there&#x27;s nothing your average 12 year old couldn&#x27;t handle, so its
&#x22;family friendly&#x22; enough for the Disney brand and its PG 13 rating.
Both my wife and daughter were favorably impressed as well, so check it
out while you can.
