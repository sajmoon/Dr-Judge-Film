&#x22;When I saw you, I believed it was a sign ... that something new can
come into this world.&#x22; Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) <br /><br />Disney&#x27;s John Carter is science fiction for the attention challenged,
from Earth to Mars and then various locations on the red planet to make
you feel lost and long for good old earth.<br /><br />Based on the early 20th century Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom novels (he
of Tarzan fame), John Carter is a hodgepodge of scenes from Star Wars
installments, Cowboys and Aliens, and Dances with Wolves enough for the
Civil War vet of the title to be Kevin Costner transplanted by magic to
Mars. Ironically it was Burroughs who may have started the
multi-layered, ultra-fantastic sci-fi movement in modern cinema.<br /><br />However the pedigree of the film is high-toned: Andrew Stanton,
director of Toy Story 3 and writer of Wall-e, and novelist Michael
Chabon of Spider-Man 2. It&#x27;s just that coming now, the film looks retro
and dramatically puzzling. Too bad they couldn&#x27;t have made it more
digestible.<br /><br />Taylor Kitch&#x27;s Carter needs to get home after he saves the Princess of
Mars from shape-shifting bad guys, Jar-Jar Binks like ugly warriors,
and a plot needing Spock to unravel. The 4-armed Tharks most remind me
of Star Wars&#x27; exotic characters although now they are 12 foot motion
capture/CG fearsome, also reminding me of the Na&#x27;vi in Avatar, a far
more peaceful lot.<br /><br />Fine actors Mark Strong as Matai Shang, the lead baddie, and Ciaran
Hinds as Tardos Mors, the beleaguered father of the princess, give the
mess the gravity it needs as we sort out who actually is bad and good.<br /><br />John Carter is saved in the end by an accelerated plot that leaves
little time to try to figure out the plot. Nobody said space travel
would be easy and uncomplicated.
