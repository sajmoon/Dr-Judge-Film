The movie, based on work by classic pulp novelist Edgar Burroughs, is a
fantastic if slightly dated spectacle of modern science fiction with
classical science fiction themes. leaving out spoilers which you can
find easily enough I&#x27;ll say that this movie is exactly what fans of the
genre and adventure movies have been waiting for - strong intelligent
characters, a thoughtful and compelling plot about the destiny of a
civilization and scenery rendered so beautifully it will surely win
best animation or cinematography. By all means see this on the big
screen, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.<br /><br />JN
