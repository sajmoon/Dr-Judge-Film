Saw this in a preview screening in Montreal. As I expected, this will
become an instant classic and cult following.<br /><br />A story which brings all the genres that many movies bear through movie
history: western, sci-fi, adventure and roman peplums.<br /><br />Excellent special effects and motion capture. Lots of CGI and also
filmed on the spot in the Utah Desert, passing as Barsoom (Mars).
Acting is excellent, though some weird dialogue.<br /><br />Andrew Stanton did pass his test from Pixar animator to real-life movie
director.<br /><br />And of course, people will re-discover Edgar Rice Borroughs great
literature (which was way more than just Tarzan...). And for starters,
this author is portrayed in the movie by a former Spy Kid (Darryl
Sabara) Not to miss !
