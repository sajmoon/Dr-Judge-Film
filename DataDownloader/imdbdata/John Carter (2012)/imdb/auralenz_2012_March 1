This film was a property I longed for to be made, and now I have to
wait over 2 years for Gods of Mars. <br /><br />The earth moments are virtually like the book-he is a ex-Confederate
soldier, etc.. and though we get to Mars pretty quickly, it didn&#x27;t seem
rushed. The dialogue about the Martian politics might be too much for
some to follow, but go with it-you wouldn&#x27;t want it to sound like
eye-gouging SW prequel politics&#x97;on Barsoom there is so much to see. <br /><br />For this fan-troll its obvious that Stanton is holding back (cuz Disney
said Warhoons or Banths, Andrew, you cant have both), and I want
everyone to know that this great movie, being the origin story, is
merely an appetizer for all the action in the next several
installments. The Tharks are well done-I like what they do when they
first see the Helium and Zodangan ships, which by the way, though
different from the buoyancy tank ships described by ERB, still have
that wooden, jump from ship to ship among cannon fire, pirate ship
movie moments. <br /><br />Kitsch, Collins-yum, Dafoe, and the other actors(who we&#x27;ll see more of
next go round), provided the perfect gravitas required to believe where
we are, and their thoughts about the project are in interview clips all
over the net. The labor of love enthusiasm for the source that Stanton
had is plainly evident in everything on the screen, including the
actors portrayals of these archetype characters. The music really fit
every moment. I had to laugh in satisfaction when the crescendos during
an action sequence reminded me of John Williams. <br /><br />I was worried about plot tweaks-the Therns especially, but since the
story is headed in the same direction as the books, they are extremely
minor. The CGI is great. I don&#x27;t understand when people slam it.
Whether its Avatar or anything, we all know there actually is no such
place as Barsoom, Pandora, etc.. So, some haters will always see
fantastic fauna as &#x22;fake- looking&#x22;. If someone can have the suspension
of disbelief in horrid successes like Transformers, Twilight, or Tron
to a degree, even found footage movies, Stanton&#x27;s JC should be gospel ! <br /><br />I hope we see more old-fashioned sci-fi/fantasy committed to the
screen. ERB&#x27;s Pellucidar, Venus, and Caprona, just as a start. There
are more great works out there besides PK Dick, and Stanton is the
trailblazer for their realization. I can easily name dozens of authors.
So if you think Hollywood has gone off the deep end-and many times I
don&#x27;t blame you, please be relieved that tentpole films like JC still
can be made. 10 out of 10. Five Stars. I loved it. Thank you Andrew.
(So what if I&#x27;m biased, and will see it again at midnight next week)
