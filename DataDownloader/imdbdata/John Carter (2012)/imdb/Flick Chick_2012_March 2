I have so much to say about this movie but I guess I should start with
what or who is John Carter.<br /><br />John Carter (Kitsch) is an American Civil War soldier who is
transported to Mars. He first encounters the green skinned warlike
nomads known as the Tharks and, due to his superhuman powers (Mars
gravity and all that), quickly becomes embroiled in not only the
political issues of the Tharks, but those of the red skinned, humanoid
Martians as well. The humanoids control Mars through a series of city
states with Zodanga annihilating everything in it&#x27;s path. Helium is the
last free state. Helium also has a beautiful and feisty Princess
(Collins) and a political marriage to save all has been arranged. Then
she meets our handsome hero&#x85;.yep you guessed it. The two fall in love
and are now fighting for not just what they love and believe in but who
they love and believe in.<br /><br />This movie is based on the book Princess of Mars, the first in a series
of 11 novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs 100 years ago. They are
also known as The Barsoom or John Carter of Mars series. A lot of what
you have seen in these types of movies up until now has drawn, in some
way, on this series of novels. Star Wars, Avatar, Babylon 5, Flash
Gordon and even some Indiana Jones. I am sure the list is endless but
Sci Fi is not my genre. When you watch John Carter, you will be able to
pick the similarities immediately.<br /><br />If you are aware of this movie&#x27;s existence, then you are probably aware
of the negative attention it has garnered. I saw this movie over 2
weeks ago and have had to watch as people all over the internet trash
it. They have laughed at Disney for spending $250 million on an obvious
dud. They have said Disney has distanced itself from the movie before
it&#x27;s release. They have criticised everything from the trailers to the
posters to the casting of 2 unknowns as the leads. Oh and they have
done all this without having seen the movie! These people are best
ignored and sent back to their mother&#x27;s basements!! <br /><br />Now, I will say that Disney has done itself NO favours whatsoever with
the posters and trailers for John Carter. This I will concede. But I
have found the best trailer on You Tube and it was made by serious fans
of the books thejohncarterfiles.<br /><br />Please, if you are going to watch a trailer for this movie, make it
this one. It just gives you a much better idea of what the movie looks
like.<br /><br />So what did I think? I LOVED it. I really, truly did. I wanted to see
it because I had read so much about it over the last few years. Sci Fi
may not be my thing but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on
in the land of movie making.<br /><br />This movie has all the blockbuster action we have come to expect from
this genre. The CGI is spectacular. The Martian characters are
fantastic. The stand out Martian is without a doubt Woola, a pet that
adopts John Carter and is as ugly as he is adorable. An ugly slug like
animal that will melt your heart. Trust me :) There is good vs evil.
There is Martian vs Martain. There is human vs human. There is serious
stuff. There is fun stuff. A stand out scene I just cannot resist
mentioning&#x85;.<br /><br />When Carter does arrive on Mars, his introduction to Tars Tarkas is
absolutely hilarious. The mistake with his name becomes an ongoing gag
throughout the movie and to great affect. Even our hero gives up,
smiles and just shakes his head. Oh and yes, there is a very easy and
believable reason why they all speak English.<br /><br />This movie is for everyone who likes Star Wars or Avatar. It&#x27;s for
everyone who ever wished they could go to Mars. It&#x27;s for everyone who
likes a love story between a handsome hero and beautiful, spirited
Princess. It&#x27;s for everyone who wants to see a great movie and escape,
literally, to another world for 2 hours. It&#x27;s for everyone who likes a
simple Sci Fi story. It&#x27;s for everyone who likes a layered story they
can think on a little later. It&#x27;s for little kids (although at over 2
hours running length it may just be a tad too long for our littlest
movie goers) and it&#x27;s for big kids.<br /><br />Ignore the critics and go see this movie. I think you will enjoy it. I
saw it in 3D and I usually think 3D is a waste of money (sorry studios)
but for this movie, fork out the extra $5 and see it in 3D.<br /><br />Mars never looked so good.
