By far the best movie I have seen in a long while. I saw it twice and
want to go back for more. Why this got such bad reviews in the media is
a mystery to me. It had everything and more I could expect out of an
adventure/fantasy/sci-fi movie. It&#x27;s Pirates of the Caribean on Mars,
but better.<br /><br />My concern is that Disney spent a lot of money on this movie and at
this point the media is calling it a flop. This negative media will
only cause less people to see the movie hence more of a flop. Go see
this movie and I know you will agree.<br /><br />We need to prove the media wrong and make sure Disney continues this
awesome series. SAVE MARS.
