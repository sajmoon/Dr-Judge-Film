The movie lived up to our every expectation. Rainy Sunday afternoon and
we did not even realize we were in the theater for more than 2 hours.
The movie was visually entertaining, the characters were wonderful to
watch and the main story was so interesting. When over the entire
theater erupted in applause. If you are looking for the Oscar
performance of a lifetime from these actors, you wont get it here, but
you will fall in love with both leads and you will really enjoy the
great sub plots that keep you interested.<br /><br />Don&#x27;t let the critics fool you!! Take the time to see this fun movie
and cross your fingers there is a sequel.
