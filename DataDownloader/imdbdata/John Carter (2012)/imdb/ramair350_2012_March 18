I am an older viewer who tends to like art films much more than
&#x22;blockbusters&#x22;. I don&#x27;t like &#x22;Transformers&#x22;. I generally don&#x27;t like
super-hero movies. And I didn&#x27;t expect to LOVE this film.<br /><br />But I did. It is an absolutely outstanding piece of entertainment, and
I believe in 20 years it will be viewed as an important piece of sci-fi
that was completely overlooked. It saddens me for the cast and crew who
obviously put 110% of their effort into making this film.<br /><br />The movie does have a familiar feel to it, and that feel is the one
that I got viewing the original 3 Star Wars movies, with some Indiana
Jones and Avatar thrown in. I haven&#x27;t enjoyed a film this much since
&#x22;Inception&#x22;. Yes, it is that good. It is action-packed, but not
action-for-the-sake-of-action. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t explain things neatly
like &#x22;Star Trek&#x22;; it is much more oriented toward &#x22;Star Wars&#x22; type of
fiction. Clever writing, great pacing, unbelievably believable
landscapes, and spot-on performances by the actors make this THE must-
see film of the year, if you have any remote interest in a fun-filled
sci-fi flick. GO SEE IT!
