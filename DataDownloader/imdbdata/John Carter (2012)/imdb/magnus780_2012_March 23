When Disney made its announcements on spending a quarter of a billion
on this movie and put out trailers showing what appeared to be a great
sci-fi movie, I thought to myself - maby Disney is going to use a
successful producer who did a lot of the Pixar Movies and be a big
success. I made the mistake of judging a movie on the theatrical
trailers and boy was I disappointed.<br /><br />I went to the IMAX theatre on the second week of John Carter&#x27;s showing
and was horrified by the fact that Disney would even consider investing
into such titanic disaster of a movie. Though it will not flop as bad
as Water World, I would say that it pretty close and will set Disney
back a chunk of change.<br /><br />I have loved all of Andrew Stanton&#x27;s Pixar films and was sceptical when
he took on this project to make a sci-fi/fantasy film. Wall-E was a
much bigger success than this show. Sadly I think Andrew should stick
to cartoon films and leave the sci-fi to Lucas, Cameron, Spielberg, and
other producers who have made their mark in this industry.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to any moderate to hard core fan of
sci-fi movies. Many of the people who were in the theatre at the time
when I was there were not impressed and were complaining on the way out
about how long the show was and complaining about the storyline - how
it jumped all over the place. This movie is a Disney film so it is
intended to focus on family and younger children and it sticks to that
area - but doesn&#x27;t capture the same fascination as some of Disney&#x27;s
more successful shows.
