2012_March 11 
I read the John Carter books repeatedly when I was in elementary school
in the 1970&#x27;s and continue to pull them out a couple times a decade.
I&#x27;ve read the best books in the series over 15 times; they were my
Harry Potter. And Finding Nemo is one of my favorite movies, so I
because very excited when I found that he was taking over this film. So
I&#x27;ve been waiting anxiously for this movie for 2 years, or 30 years,
depending on how you count.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t think a single line of dialog from the original book &#x27;A Prince
Of Mars&#x27; made its way into the film. The director said publicly a year
ago that he was deviating significantly from the book, so that&#x27;s not a
shock or a problem. Some of the changes were improvements, some were
dumb, but his take on the story was a net plus. The spirit of the books
makes it through -- except for Burrough&#x27;s disturbing sexism, which
thankfully was more than adequately expunged from the movie.<br /><br />What&#x27;s surprising is how rushed the film was. For instance, in the
book, the core romantic relationship evolves over several months. In
the movie, it evolves over a matter of days. The characters&#x27;
relationships would ring more true to the viewer if they were given
more time -- and I mean story time, not screen time. I will be happy if
someone releases a re-cut version on DVD: either the same length with
less going on, or a mini-series length version with all the detail.
I&#x27;ve read they took a LOT of extra footage, so maybe it&#x27;s possible.<br /><br />P.S. If you&#x27;re a fan who questioned the casting of Lynn Collins as
Dejah Thoris, don&#x27;t. She is the best part of the film.
