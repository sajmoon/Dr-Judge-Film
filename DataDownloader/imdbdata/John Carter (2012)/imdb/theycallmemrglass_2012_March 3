I saw this at a preview screening in London.<br /><br />I never read any of the books so only had a vague synopsis of the story
just from trailers which didn&#x27;t really impress me much. <br /><br />Well, this turned out to be quite a blast. Its an enjoyable if very
cheesy Sci-fi fantasy blockbuster. It has the spirit and energy of
Flash Gordon including its own outrageously nonsensical but fun
premise. It isn&#x27;t as cheesy as that film but there is a definite lean
towards it. The story is quite a novel mix of Planet of the Apes,
Conan, Red Sonja, Avatar, Star Wars and Superman (yep this is a
superhero movie too). We even have a western thrown in the mix at the
beginning. I was going to say there isn&#x27;t anything original here but
how can I? This story was published in the 19th century so from that
perspective, I can now see a lot of plot influences deriving from this
in later SF/fantasy films.<br /><br />A lot of money was spent on this movie and it shows. The special
effects here are pretty awesome. Not necessarily ground breaking,
everything on screen has been done before but its all smoothly done at
a grand scale though not quite to the scale of the Star Wars prequels.
Effects that stood out for me were John Carters &#x22;Hulk&#x22; like jumps,
Martian sky ship battles, green martians (as good as Avatar), and a
cute monster dog sidekick that almost steels the show.<br /><br />Another major feature of the film was the cinematography. Its quite
spectacular and for a barren dead desert planet, its surprisingly
stunning.<br /><br />One of the biggest surprise for me was the 3D. Its post conversion
which most often results in poorer quality than films which are filmed
in 3D from the start. But an exception can be made here. This is hands
down the best 3d conversion film I have seen. The 3d depth was
outstanding and really shows its power in numerous landscape and action
scenes. This is probably the second best 3d live action film I&#x27;ve seen
overall (either filmed in 3d or post converted) and I am normally
anti-3d when it comes to live action films. <br /><br />Taylor Kitsch who plays John Carter has just about enough screen
presence portraying a likable anti hero with a punchy attitude and a
sense of past history haunting him. Its a Han Solo type role but he
plays it more brooding. There is even a Princess Leia and the age old
storyline of helping a Princess to fight a war but each with their own
agendas. Its all very clich&#xE9;d, yet still enjoyable. <br /><br />As much fun as I had with this, there is no denying that there is a lot
wrong with it too. I could pick on flaws and lack of logic all day long
with this film some of which are smack on the head stupid and some
elements I desperately wished more or better development on. The
dialogue while often funny, also often dive bombs into
cringe-worthiness (much like a Lucas script), the developing romance
was very disjointed and sometimes embarrassing (think Anakin and Padme
levels of embarrassment). The 3 way war politics was not very clear,
major characters not fleshed out enough and there&#x27;s a whole lot of
story loopholes. Yet there is still a lot more fun to be had to
override those flaws. <br /><br />I have a feeling that book lovers will be disappointed because I can
detect a lot of back story is missing here and key characters seem very
short changed on their development and motives (particularly with the
green martians) which I am sure would have been fully fleshed out in
the book. However, I reckon if you enjoy films like Thor and GI Joe,
you&#x27;ll have a great time with this. This wont be a classic or even a
cult movie but it is a satisfying piece of cinema escapism. And its
enough for me to want to read the books!
