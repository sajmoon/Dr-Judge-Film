I was pleasantly surprised by this action packed movie!!Anyone who
loves science fiction or adventure type movies I urge to go see this. I
also applaud the people responsible for casting Lynn Collins.She is
Great! Finally a movie with a woman fighter who is not pencil thin and
very well built.I don&#x27;t know why Hollywood is obsessed with sickly
looking women beating up men these days. This movie is filled with
almost everything you would want to keep you glued to the story
line,Action,romance and a little comedy.I liked the fact also the
mixture of the story line with aliens and humans but not exactly like
star wars. Very uniquely balanced storyline. <br /><br />10 stars to this great movie
