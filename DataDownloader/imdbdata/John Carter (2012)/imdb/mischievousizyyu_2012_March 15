Star Wars + Superman + Avatar + Pocahontas Worst.Movie.EVER. I think
the Johnny Depp version of Willy Wonka was better than this movie. I
want 2 1/2 hours of my life back. I would rather take an 8hr defensive
driving class than watch this movie ever again.<br /><br />I wanted to walk out after the first five minutes, but unfortunately I
was forced to stay until the end. I hope ILM sues Disney for their star
wars references- the plot and the pod racers. All it was missing was
&#x27;In a Galaxy Far Far Away&#x27; and a better script writer.<br /><br />I want my $28 back- 2 tickets for 3D,2 1/2 hours of my life, and an
apology from Disney.<br /><br />Awful. Terrible. Disastrous. Degraging. Violating.
