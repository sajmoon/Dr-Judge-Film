It&#x27;s not as pretty but it does take you to another world. Taylor Kitsch
and Lynn Collins are the two leads. Although they are relative unknowns
they are perfectly cast. There are some familiar faces like Dominic
West &#x26; Mark Strong. It is best just to sit back &#x26; enjoy the ride. This
is a two bags of popcorn movie. If you go to the concession stand you
might miss something. But since you will probably want to see it again
that&#x27;s OK. John Carter has a pet that kind of looks like a bulldog. He
provides the only comic relief. The ending sets you up for a sequel. I
am eagerly awaiting that. And also a third. Mark Strong makes a good
villain and I am not sure what happens to him at the end. I&#x27;ll
definitely have to see it again.
