John Carter is probably the best movie of the year that hardly anyone
will see.The victim of poor timing and poor marketing, it is engaging
and spectacular and its director has put enough Pixar-Disney into it
that it is really well worth seeing.While not The Incredibles it is no
&#x22;Waterworld&#x22; either and does not deserve its negative reviews.It is a
classic Sci-fi popcorn movie that relies heavily on CG green screen and
effects and could never have been made before the last decade. My main
criticism of this film and of all new 3D films such as this is that
they must not be shot in 2D and converted. The 3D allows the audience
to be immersed in the scene or feel they are looking through a massive
window and requires longer clips and some first person shots and should
avoid any shots with a short focal length .Avatar is exceptional
because of its ability to do all that and I don&#x27;t believe this film
benefits from it but could have.Hopefully a sequel will follow as
Burroughs did write several novels set on Mars. .Better title would
have been Barsoom-Mars
