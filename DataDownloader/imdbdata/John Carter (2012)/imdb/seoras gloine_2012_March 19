As one of the few people I know who has ever read the original John
Carter books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, I have always hoped that some
bold company would make a movie about this unknown long lost hero.<br /><br />John Carter of Mars was the very first action hero of what is now known
as romantic space opera. ERB also wrote the much more famous Tarzan
series (but John Carter is much better than Tarzan IMHO.) All fantasy
and science fiction heroic adventure including Conan &#x26; Star Wars can
trace their roots to John Carter of Mars. Classic science fiction
writers like A.C.Clarke, Heinlein, &#x26; Bradbury cited Burrough&#x27;s John
Carter as inspiration for their works.<br /><br />I was very worried about the avalanche of negative reviews about the
movie. But I &#x26; all my friends really liked the movie itself. I was very
pleased to see that Disney was very truthful to the original source
material of &#x27;A Princess of Mars&#x27;. The action, special effects, plot,
and music were all very evocative of ERB&#x27;s wonderful novels.<br /><br />I think the reason why &#x27;John Carter&#x27; did not connect with the majority
of moviegoers was since John Carter is so old (100 years), that very
few people, even nerds, have ever read the books. Very few people know
anything at all about John Carter.<br /><br />Another reason is that since John Carter was the original action hero,
every great fictional hero that came after him has already had a big
budget movie made, for example: Conan, Flash Gordon, &#x26; others. This is
why many critics have said after seeing John Carter, that &#x27;they&#x27;ve seen
all this before&#x27;.<br /><br />&#x27;John Carter&#x27; did not give audiences anything new precisely because it
is so old. If the movie had come out 10-15 years ago, I believe it
would have been far better received.<br /><br />So if you like grand, old space opera epics reminiscent of the 1950&#x27;s,
go see John Carter. And read ERB&#x27;s John Carter books. (&#x27;A Princess of
Mars&#x27; is free on amazon kindle.)
