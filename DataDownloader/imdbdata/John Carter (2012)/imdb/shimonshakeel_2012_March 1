The man John Carter travelled all alone from Earth to Mars. No time
machine , no hidden gate, just a simple chain with a pendant helped him
to do so. Most astonishing thing is, He loved mars more than earth and
wanted to stay there forever even after death. One thing they showed
pretty good is that people in Mars are red and have different colour
blood. <br /><br />John carter&#x27;s acting was not too attractive. but his girl friend was
hot. The story is not strong enough to drive a huge amount of audience.
In the beginning, it was pretty confusing what actually is going on ,
but after 15 minutes things start changing and interesting. <br /><br />This movie probably shoot in 2D and later converted in 3D. I watched in
IMAX 3D but still dint see much 3D effects. Graphics was good. They
designed the long tooth aliens pretty well. <br /><br />At the end, I would suggest you to watch the movie with your family.
Not a friendly hangout type of movie it is.
