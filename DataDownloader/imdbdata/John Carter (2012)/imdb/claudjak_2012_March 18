2012_March 18 
I was expecting this movie to be bad with all the press of it flopping
on opening night. This movie was great. Perhaps my expectations were
low and made it that way, but it appears to be true to the book&#x27;s
wonder- not all true but relatively true. It is a different sci-fi
story filled with wonder, magic and love. My husband and I really
enjoyed it and we left appreciating all the special effects the
producers made. I particularly liked the dog and the screaming green
babies. It had heart and detail. Sure, one can think leaving- wow that
was cheesy but one can also say that about avatar, star-wars,
spider-man, etc... If you want to be excessively critical and not let
your mind go into the world of imagination then I suppose you can say
whatever you want but it is not suppose to be real. It was- what it was
suppose to be- fun, exciting, and imaginative.
