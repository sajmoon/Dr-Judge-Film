I love SCIFI/Fantasy movies, and this movie just might be the best
movie I have seen. Before I saw this movie, Avatar was one of my
favorites, but now I believe this movie beats it. It left me hoping for
a sequel. The acting was sublime and the plot kept my full attention
through the entire movie. Not to mention the woman playing as the
princess was probably the most beautiful woman I ever saw. Lynn Collins
in her costume beats princess Leia and then some! I rarely even take
the time to write a review for a movie but with such a performance, I
could not resist. This movie is a MUST see for all fantasy lovers!! It
was worth every penny I paid to see it!
