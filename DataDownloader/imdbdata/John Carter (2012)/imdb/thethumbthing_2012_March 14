I was very excited to see this film, after reading numerous review and
checking the trailer i was very intrigued to see this movie in its full
3D glory. Technically I was rather disappointed with the wide angle
shots of the vast expanse of Mars with the characters matted into these
shots looking slightly out of proportion to their surroundings, the
model making looked like models and let down the overall look of this
film. John Carter looked like a hobbit in some scenes next to the 12
foot aliens... it just didn&#x27;t look real to me. The film has its good
points as well, some nice CGI, the acting is fine, but the film
unfortunately lacks a certain realism which i missed. would i recommend
this film, yes, its a good pop corn film which i would have been happy
watching without the 3D. I don&#x27;t think this film was shot 3D but
converted in post production. Overall this film did not live up to my
expectations, but still worth a look as this is only my opinion.
