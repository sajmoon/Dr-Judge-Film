At long last! As a reader of this series in the 1960s, I wondered when
it would finally come to the screen. The visual problems have been
solved spectacularly by green screens and computer physiognomy mapping.
The screenplay is good but too complex for those who haven&#x27;t read at
least &#x27;A Princess of Mars,&#x27; &#x27;The Gods of Mars,&#x27; and &#x27;Warlord of Mars.&#x27;
(Also the title: John Carter is too bland and tells nothing). It seems
like the Disney folk were afraid they wouldn&#x27;t get a chance to film
sequels, so they crammed too much into one movie. This is similar to
the original filming of Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune, where everyone in the
audience was handed a glossary of characters and terms! The acting and
filming are fine, the sets and costumes hewing close to Burrough&#x27;s
descriptions and to the iconic Frazetta paintings of many years ago.
Nice flow to the script and plenty of action. Like Harry Potter and the
Star Wars epics, the required arena battle is there. The biggest
problem is that the writers have given the Therns limitless power in
shape-shifting. Taken to its logical conclusion, if this were the case,
anyone on this violent world would have to give passwords to everyone
near them and ask for the password every few seconds.
