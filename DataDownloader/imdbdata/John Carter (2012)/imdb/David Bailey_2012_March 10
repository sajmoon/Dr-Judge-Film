John Carter is almost a fun movie once you get past the
humans-destroying-a-planet back-story, and the &#x22;so you&#x27;re a (Disney)
princess&#x22; marketing ploys.<br /><br />The movie contains some very nice visuals and action sequences, but
unfortunately only so-so acting. It&#x27;s hard to feel connected with the
protagonists.<br /><br />It tries to straddle the fantasy and science fiction genres and does so
adequately.<br /><br />I most enjoyed some of the retro-science fiction elements,
unfortunately, the modernization of them takes some of the uniqueness
away.
