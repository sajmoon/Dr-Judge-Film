2012_March 11 
When this film started, for a moment I thought that I was in the wrong
theater. I was thinking this has absolutely nothing to do with the
trailer that I saw. And for those of you who go and see it, I just want
to say &#x22;hang in there&#x22;. It will all make sense in the end, although
there is a lot of stuff in the film that will remain unexplained, but
the beginning will makes sense in the end. I thought that this film was
enjoyable enough, but some of the dialog was just too dang long. This
film is over two hours long and you do begin to get frustrated with the
actors having so much to say. I was thinking, &#x22;Shut up already, don&#x27;t
you have a planet to save&#x22;. Anyway, the film could have been shorter
with less dialogue and not missed a minute of the action. I do have to
say that I thought the ending was brilliant. It had that &#x22;Somewhere in
Time&#x22; thing going on. This was a pretty decent leap for Director Andrew
Stanton who usually makes excellent animated films like Wall-E and Toy
Story. I guess stepping into a new genre of filmmaking can be difficult
and a lot of directors who have tried to step out of their box have
flopped. I think that Mr. Stanton gave it a pretty decent effort and
I&#x27;m looking forward to what he can do once he gets comfortable. As for
Taylor Kitsch (John Carter) and Lynn Collins (Dejah Thoris), I became
familiar with these two actors in X-Men Origins: Wolverine; Taylor as
Gambit and Lynn as Kayla Silverfox. I guess someone from casting saw
the film and thought&#x85;. These two would look good together (and they
do). They both actually did a pretty good job with the script that they
had to work with, however I really wanted a little more (believable)
emotion from Lynn. After the film was over I wasn&#x27;t exactly hopping out
of my chair with excitement, but it was a decent film and worth going
to see at the theater. I did not see this film in 3D and after seeing
it in 2D, there weren&#x27;t any parts in the film that made me think that I
missed something by not seeing it in 3D (so save that money). This film
was better than okay, but not outstanding and for that reason I am
giving this film an amber light.
