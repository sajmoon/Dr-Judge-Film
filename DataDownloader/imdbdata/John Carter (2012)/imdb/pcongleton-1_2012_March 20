Seeing this film definitely makes me want to look into the character&#x27;s
original roots, but not for reasons you might think. Edgar Rice
Burroughs, the man who brought us Tarzan, also created the story of
John Carter of Mars. He also ends up, through clever writing, being
John Carter&#x27;s fictional nephew Edgar &#x22;Ned&#x22; Rice Burroughs in the film,
in fact, the story of John Carter has been around for 100 years in
various forms or another. The reason I want to do more research on this
character, even though I have heard of the story and even read one of
the comics 30 years ago, is I really do not know enough to do a fair
comparison. My issue is; I couldn&#x27;t see any credibility in
rookie-director, Andrew Stanton&#x27;s depiction of taking a man out of 1881
Earth and sending him to an alien world that he could never even
imagined. I mean, hell, they barely had light bulbs in 1881. I want to
see how far Burroughs took this, because that is what was killing me
with the movie, because I could not accept what was being fed to me.
It&#x27;s a shame too, because the movie starts out good.<br /><br />We get a majestic introduction to what is happening on the planet Mars
and then we end up in the Wild West in 1881 America. We get treated to
some good comedy in the guise of Bryan Cranston, as a Union Colonal who
locks up John Carter in jail and has to pursue him once he escapes,
only to be caught in the same trouble that John has to deal with at
that moment. Even the way John gets to Mars is sell-able and with great
detail they even depict for us John painstakingly trying to adjust to
the planet&#x27;s gravitational pull, that, ala&#x27; Superman, gives John
enhanced strength and ability and thus makes him an object that the
local species find interesting. I even had no problem with the
insect-like CGI&#x27;d green Tharks that capture John initially. As the film
went on I realized that there is no way this film has sold to me the
idea that if this story really had happened it would look like this.
The credibility is not there. As I have said a million times before, no
matter what kind of film it is you are making you still have to pass
the believability test and this one fails at it, which is a shame,
since they went through the whole routine of explaining to us in detail
about John learning how to jump and run, they even come up with a
device that allows him to eventually understand what Mars inhabitants
are saying.<br /><br />There are other issues that make this one hard to enjoy. Although, she
is beautiful and has a great figure, Lynn Collins, who plays our femme
fatal, the Princess Dejah Thoris, gives an acting performance that was
tough to handle. Maybe it was some of the dialogue that was handed to
her, but I and the group I went to the movies with were making fun of
her by the end of the film. &#x22;Oh John!&#x22; The other issue I had with this
film was the fact that when dealing with this much material you need to
be careful with your time. Long movies are long movies and if you
handle the content well and don&#x27;t give the audiences reasons to start
disliking things, than even a seven hour long movie can be enjoyable.
By the time we get to the 20 minute mark of the film you are already
seeing indications that &#x22;rookie-director&#x22; isn&#x27;t sure what things to cut
to get this thing to a manageable length. Instead of cutting tedious,
boring things out of the film, maybe some of that &#x22;Oh John&#x22; stuff,
Stanton tried to get clever with the editing in the action scenes and
there a huge amounts of jump cuts, edits that make no sense and
continuity issues. When you are force fed that kind of stuff you tend
to get bored or insulted.<br /><br />OK, enough of the bashing. Let&#x27;s get into some of the good things. The
story is quite good actually and I think you can credit that back to
Burroughs, because I fear, if this group had tried to write something
original this may have come out even worse. There are a lot of cute and
humorous moments that make you smile. The film is beautiful. The CGI
and all the special effects are quite good. It was nice hearing voices
like Willem Dafoe and Thomas Hayden Church as the main Tharks and Mark
Strong gives a good performance as the evil Matai Shang, who is the
architect of all the chaos on Mars. I feel things may have worked out
better if this had been broken up into two movies, thus giving Stanton
more room to clean up the edits and make things flow better. You can&#x27;t
have a wide shot of John Carter fleeing away on horseback, away from
the town, and have in the very next shot Cranston and eight or nine
Union soldiers about twenty feet behind him. There has to be a device
or explanation as to how that happened or it is considered a mistake.
Whoops, you just lost the attention of another film-goer. I didn&#x27;t hate
this film. I probably will watch it again someday on DVD and I did
rather enjoy some aspects if it, but in the end, the mistakes,
silliness and tediousness took its toll.
