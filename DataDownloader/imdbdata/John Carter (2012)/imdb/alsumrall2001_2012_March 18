OK, a ten is pushing it, but this is a very, very well done film with a
very good story. Not a campy adventure like Flash Gordon (which was
fun) but a serious science fiction/fantasy film literally from another
age. Makes Star Wars seem childish and is a significantly better story
than Avatar and certainly does not have the environmental sop you see
in so many films. Serious actors, serious script, and serious
direction. No attempts at cheap humor (although there are bits of humor
here and there and there is one character you HAVE to like)nor juvenile
distractions and none of the self flagellation you see in so many
sci-fi and fantasy films where the characters wallow in dark misery and
keep a stone faced grimace all through the film. I really can&#x27;t compare
it to another film, it stands alone and you come out of the theater
with a spring in your step. I think this film will gain increasing
acceptance...and it is a great stand alone film. Will it get an Oscar,
no, but it is a film that hits on all eight cylinders which is a quite
rare event so I give it a ten for that. Disney spent 250 million on it
to get it right. They should be congratulated.
