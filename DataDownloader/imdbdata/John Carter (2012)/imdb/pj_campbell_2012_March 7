2012_March 7 
This is a VERY condensed version of my review from my blog: <br /><br />For over a hundred years, Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; eleven book &#x27;Barsoom&#x27;
series, which began with &#x27;A Princess of Mars&#x27;, has been an inspiration
for many of our most well known science fiction films, and has become a
small staple of popular culture. Things like &#x27;Star Wars&#x27;, &#x27;Avatar&#x27;,
&#x27;Flash Gordon&#x27;, &#x27;Buck Rogers&#x27; as well as authors like Ray Bradbury and
Arthur C. Clarke have all been inspired by Burroughs and his many
characters and their adventures on the planet Barsoom, or as we know it
as, Mars. But no character from the series has become more popular over
time than John Carter, the hero of many of Burroughs&#x27; &#x27;Barsoom&#x27; novels.
Hollywood has spent many years of attempting to bring John Carter and
Barsoom to the big screen, and now Academy award winning director
Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, Wall-e) and Walt Disney Pictures have
worked together to finally give this series it&#x27;s due on the big screen.
Stanton has managed to bring the incredible world Burroughs envisioned
all those years ago to the big screen in a true pulp fiction style
adventure that fans and newcomers alike will fall in love with. This is
science fiction, as well as action and adventure, at its finest.<br /><br />This is filmmaking at it&#x27;s absolute finest. A riproaring adventure that
takes you to a whole new world, and you forget about everything else
around you. The cast, many that are up and comers, as well as great
character actors throughout, really help bring the movie to life. From
beginning to end I was glued to the screen in this world. Everything
from the sweeping score, great direction, amazing cast, and fun action
and adventure feel of the movie reminded me of days long gone from
Hollywood. Movies that are made as pure escapism fun in a pulp fiction
style adventure. &#x27;John Carter&#x27; is a return to the Hollywood we all fell
in love, and I can&#x27;t recommend this movie enough. For me, this must
have been what it was like seeing &#x27;Star Wars&#x27; for the first time on May
25, 1977. I love this movie more than I&#x27;ve loved any other movie in a
long time. Go see it, and I hope you fall in love with it as I have.<br /><br />I also have to say, as a fan of the book series, I really was pleased
to see that it sticks to the source material wherever possible, and
only deviates when it will work better for the movie. Stanton makes
sure, as I said before, that fans of the series will embrace this
movie, and he does an amazing job doing that. I never thought I&#x27;d see
the &#x27;Barsoom&#x27; series so well done on the big screen, but Stanton has
done it in spades. He&#x27;s brought a childhood fantasy to life in a way
many books don&#x27;t get the chance to.<br /><br />10/10
