Storytelling and escapism at its best.From the lavishness of every
scene it&#x27;s obvious that they&#x27;ve spent a lot of money getting us to
Barsoom,and they have totally succeeded-Some of this is gasp aloud
stuff. It&#x27;s above all a story,and Stanton spends a little time
explaining key points,and giving us insights into the complex
characters-These are no caricatures in an all-action explosion fest
(although there&#x27;s plenty of action!)-There&#x27;s a richness you don&#x27;t
always see in modern films and by the end I loved John Carter,Dejah
Thoris and the rest,even though they were still surprising me. Only
Star Wars and Avatar have created such an impression How critics can
appreciate a film like The Muppets but try and sink this is a
mystery.Maybe critics are very young and unimaginative? Maybe the genre
has always been a love it or hate it thing and JC will never win best
film.Alas.
