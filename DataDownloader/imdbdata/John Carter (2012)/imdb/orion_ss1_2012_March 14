The &#x22;critics&#x22; and I rarely agree on what is and is not a good film;
this was another excellent example of that pattern.<br /><br />I went expecting to see a fantasy adventure flick; no complicated plot,
lots of action, and some neat special effects ( part of my PI day
celebration, what you&#x27;d expect of an engineer ). And that is what I
got. A few twists I didn&#x27;t see to offset the one&#x27;s I did.<br /><br />I opted for the 3D version ( which my girlfriend enjoyed more than me )
and that might have been a mistake for me. The set up to get a Civil
War cavalryman to Mars was, by Science Fiction standards, believable.
The set up for John Carter&#x27;s characteristics ( skills as a warrior and
tenacity ) was well done; his haunted past was brought to light a
little more haphazardly and, for my taste, a little confusing, done in
quick flashbacks. The set up for the conflict between the tall ( no
where near 12 foot tall unless John Carter was 8 to 9 foot tall himself
) green folk and the more human red men ( and women, basically
Caucasians with red tattoos ) was also well done, if somewhat
predictable. And ( not a spoiler since it was discussed in the IMDb
quotes ) why the green folk called him &#x22;Virginia&#x22; was a hoot.<br /><br />There seemed to be as many female warriors ( red people ) as male, with
interesting armor differences.<br /><br />If you go to a flick to catch errors, this one has them, so you won&#x27;t
be disappointed. But if you just want to escape for a couple of hours,
this is still the one to watch. I&#x27;m hoping the DVD will be available
without the 3D, but I do look forward to watching it again.
