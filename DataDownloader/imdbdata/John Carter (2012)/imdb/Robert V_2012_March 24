Wow.<br /><br />I watched this and was constantly unimpressed with the CGI and
compositing used in the action scenes. I was asked to go along and see
it by a friend and I entered knowing nothing of the history and story
of this character.<br /><br />I was always wondering what the hell was going on in this movie. The
time-line is far too compressed and jumps around so fast it&#x27;s not
possible to follow or understand. <br /><br />It&#x27;s sad to say, but this is probably the worst film I&#x27;ve ever seen.
From the visual-effects being awful to watch, the story being so fast
it could not be followed right through to the overall production
quality, I can not rate this low enough.<br /><br />Feel free to disagree.
