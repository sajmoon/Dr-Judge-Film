I loved Mars series as a kid, John Carter is a boys own fantasy that
literally springs to life in a way even Burroughs could not have
thought possible. Sure the fresh adaptation may make a few diehards
raise an eyebrow..(no spoilers) but without these additives it just
would not have worked as well as it does. To be honest I have been
somewhat dismissive of 3D and rarely use it on my own screen, but this
movie is one of those deserving and spectacular 3D events. A gritty
western start leads our lad to a sci-fantasy adventure with a strong
well paced narrative and visual feast that entertains non-stop!
Art,costuming and spectacular effects will have to get gongs or there
is no justice!
