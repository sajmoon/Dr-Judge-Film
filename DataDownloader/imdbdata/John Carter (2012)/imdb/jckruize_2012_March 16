OK, somewhere between the gushers&#x27; and the haters&#x27; comments is the
reality that this isn&#x27;t a bad movie. Just not a good one.<br /><br />Clearly the filmmakers loved their source material and tried their best
to do it justice. There&#x27;s plenty of stunning design work,
superbly-rendered CGI and overall high production values. Disney might
have spent a dismaying quarter of a billion dollars on this hoped-for
&#x27;tentpole&#x27; entertainment, but at least the money is on the screen.<br /><br />The actors are decent too, within the confines of the trite dialogue
and genre conventions that don&#x27;t really clarify the plot. As the
titular hero, Taylor Kitsch is especially effective as a man of action
with a troubled past and not a lot of excess body fat.<br /><br />The problem is that it&#x27;s all been done and seen before. When Edgar Rice
Burroughs first dreamed of Barsoom, his notions of flying machines held
aloft by sunlight, warring tribes fighting with swords and rayguns, and
beautiful princesses with combat skills were innovative and helped
establish the nascent genre of science fiction and &#x27;planetary romance.&#x27;
But that was back in 1912, and there&#x27;s been a lot of plundering of his
ideas over the decades since. People like George Lucas and James
Cameron readily acknowledge their creative debts to Burroughs and his
contemporaries.<br /><br />The result is that there&#x27;s absolutely nothing new in this elaborate
cinematic construct. All the gorgeous detail and VFX gloss are mere
window dressing to a tired tale of swashbuckling, monsters, and
battling hordes.<br /><br />And come on -- not only do modern schoolchildren know that Mars is an
arid world with virtually no atmosphere, but a good number probably
also are aware that its gravity is about 40% of Earth&#x27;s. So why is John
Carter able to leap HUNDREDS of feet into the air, or swing a giant
boulder and chain like a yo-yo? The filmmakers provide no explanation
for this idiocy.<br /><br />I will let them off for the truncated and ridiculous title, though.
That smacks of a gutless studio marketing decision.
