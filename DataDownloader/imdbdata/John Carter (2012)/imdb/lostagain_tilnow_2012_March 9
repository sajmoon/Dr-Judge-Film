I thought the movie was spectacular! I am a big Taylor Kitsch fan and I
enjoyed every minute of John Carter. I loved the story, the characters
and scenery. I went to the 12:01am premiere IMAX 3D and had no problem
staying awake. I was still hyped hours after the ending. I plan on
reading the book now that I have so enjoyed this movie. Then I am going
to see this movie again. I love going to movies to escape into fantasy
and that is exactly what happened. I will recommend John Carter to
everyone I know and encourage them to see this film. I&#x27;m not a critic,
I just know what I like and I did like John Carter. Well worth the
money! I am also looking forward to Battleship and Savages!
