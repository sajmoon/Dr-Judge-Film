Once in a while (blue moon) comes a movie that just completely amazes
you and just takes you by surprise into the story and keeps you on the
edge of the seat with the action and gets you involved with the
characters and makes you care about the good guys and keeps you rooting
till the end with some amazing scenery and cinematography as well as a
half decent story, this ladies and gentlemen is this year&#x27;s answer to
that &#x22;dark horse&#x22;, &#x22;blockbuster&#x22; movie that we have been waiting for a
long time. The last movie I felt really good about was &#x22;The Muppets&#x22;
and &#x22;The Rise of The Planet of Apes&#x22; and then now it is &#x22;John Carter&#x22;.
What a bad-ass movie for Disney to produce.Absolutely loved the ending,
instead of just the typical fight, there were wits involved in creating
a battle of smarts.
