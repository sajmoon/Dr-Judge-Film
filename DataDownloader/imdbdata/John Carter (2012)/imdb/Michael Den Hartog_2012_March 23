I have not read the book,. but going to,. and only knew the comics and
with the Disney stamp on it my expectations were low. But walking out
off the cinema yesterday after seeing this film I had one thing on my
mind that is returning today and see it again. As a big science fiction
fan but also critic this blew me away ! It has all the elements you
want in a movie, packet in a stunning visual golden box. For me it even
had the elements that Avatar was missing,. don&#x27;t get me wrong,. Avatar
is a great movie but this one kept my attention better to the story
despite the breath taking visual settings and effects. It is a type off
movie that you do not see that much any more,.
