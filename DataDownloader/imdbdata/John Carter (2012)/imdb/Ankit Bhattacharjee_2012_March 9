I&#x27;m not going to delve into the plot and explain the film as such. Just
let me tell you, the film is very good.<br /><br />I didn&#x27;t have the highest of expectations, but I was expecting
something from the director of my favorite animation film Finding Nemo.
Believe me, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.<br /><br />The film is meant to be grand, epic and dazzling. Boy does it do that
well! The CGI is awesome, the Tharks (aliens) are very expressive and
emote excellently. The battle scenes are grand (though could have been
a little longer). The costuming is exotic, but not something out of
this world. The scale and production design are brilliant. <br /><br />Taylor Kitsch does a good job as John Carter, and he&#x27;s one guy to
definitely watch out for later. Lynn Collins does very good, better
than Kitsch, and brings the right emotions and hues to her character.
Mark Strong has a surprisingly smaller role than expected, mainly
because the villainy is split between him and Dominic West. But both
did quite well. The others do well too. Woola is so cuddly and cute,
and just too lovable, one of the most memorable bits of the film.<br /><br />The film does have some problems. The names are tough to pronounce in
some cases. The 3D conversion is totally unnecessary; take my advice,
DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IN 3D VERSION. You can have a far better viewing
experience in 2D. The beginning of the film is a bit slow and not
really great, though it does have light humor; the moment Carter
arrives on Mars, its a hell of a ride all the way through.<br /><br />Trust me, this sin&#x27;t a brainy piece of cinema. Its a bit of escapist
entertainment that dazzles and makes you forget the world for over 2
hours (just like MI4). Contrary to some complaints, the film&#x27;s plot is
not very complex even for those who have not read the books, but you
will have to be a bit attentive as the long names and the humor may
take your mind off the story, confusing you.<br /><br />All in all, a definite watch in the theaters (Note AGAIN: in 2D). Go
watch this one; I really hope they make a sequel.
