I saw it in the best circumstances possible, IMAX 3D. The CGI of the
Tharks are far and away the best part of the movie. Everything else,
including the awful dialog when the Tharks or anyone else speaks is as
imaginative as the largest ZERO you can imagine.<br /><br />The simple story from Burroughs is muddled to awfulness. <br /><br />The actors playing John Carter and Deja Thoris should be banished to
Mars for their poor acting, or perhaps I should not blame them since
there was little to work with.<br /><br />Avoid this movie. Find somewhere else to waste your time and be
disappointed with poor movie making.
