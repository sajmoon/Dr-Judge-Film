It was instantly obvious why super-budget epic got green lit by Disney.
They looked at the grosses of &#x22;Avatar&#x22; and saw boxcars for another
franchise with JCFM. On the one hand, it is overbloated with eons of
backstory and tying up loose ends. On the other hand, it is a
multi-layered introduction of a franchise that leaves no detail
unaccounted for (such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy). It is a little
strange to have such a tentpole film to be released in March instead of
the normal blockbuster season (May-August &#x26; Nov-Dec). There has been a
negative buzz going around that the marketing was botched, or that the
title was unappealing. I hope that enough word of mouth will boost this
film&#x27;s longevity, because compared to say &#x22;The Last Airbender&#x22;, this is
far better in many aspects compared to other failed would-be
franchises.<br /><br />There are complaints about how hard it is to follow the story, but
things were explained well enough that it wasn&#x27;t hard to keep track of
things. But I agree the multi-layered story lines get to be a bit much.
One daughter is being forced to marry, while another daughter who
doesn&#x27;t know is a daughter is outcast from another tribe. On the other
hand, nothing is convoluted when it comes to the love interest. And our
hero follows the same journey as &#x22;Avatar&#x22; or &#x22;Matrix&#x22; or even &#x22;Lawrence
of Arabia&#x22;. Also handled well is the shape-shifting bad guy. Like
Valdemort or other classic bad guy, he fits the role very well. Then
there is the CGI world on Mars. Once again it is hard not to recognise
the same territory that we all saw in &#x22;Avatar&#x22;. As long there is
coherent storytelling, I was willing to go along with it. There is only
one scene I would cut, and that is when Carter is thrown into a jail
cell at the beginning of the film, and he tells off an officer. The
delivery is flat and the lines are painfully bad.<br /><br />But otherwise, we are taken on a sweeping epic that is lavish and
richly detailed. It has a &#x27;spare no expense&#x27; depth to the production,
and the dialogue, editing, and music all kept the momentum going. This
momentum is critical, because it runs 2 hours and 10 minutes, and
there&#x27;s a lot of ground to cover. I think the storyline could have been
simplified a little, and try to clock in at 2 hours or less. There are
about 5 endings that get to be a somewhat tedious, but it still left me
satisfied.<br /><br />I went to see the 3D Imax version. Usually I am against seeing a post
conversion 3D movie because it feels like you are looking at cardboard
cutouts that are on a flat plane. John Carter&#x27;s post 3D conversion is
the best I have seen, especially in comparison to the lousy &#x22;Phantom
Menace&#x22; conversion. Exhibit here massive tracking shots that rotate
around subjects and retain their 3D depth as the get farther or closer
to the camera. I read the director disowned the 3D version, so I&#x27;m sure
the film is just as enjoyable in 2D.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this event film, because it will be hard to beat
a quality product like this, even though the insect tribe on Mars isn&#x27;t
as cute and cuddly as Pandorans. I&#x27;m sure Disney is betting the bank on
this one, and hopefully will get properly noticed.
