Of late, IMDb has been filled with rave reviews of even the biggest
film flops. Just look at the reviews of John Carter and you&#x27;ll see what
I mean. Makes one wonder about the reliability of these reviews. John
Carter is headed towards earning the &#x22;honor&#x22; of being the biggest and
most expensive film flop in history. It took in excess of 250 mil to
make. It opened to box office earnings of just over 30 mil. Why would
if flop so bad if it were half as good as many of these reviews make it
out to be? <br /><br />But the movie is not all bad. Pros: Great effects Great fight sequences
Visually good but I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call it visually stunning
Nice twist to plot<br /><br />Cons: Crap acting Cheesy lines worthy of a Mills and Boon love story
Boring...... Almost fell asleep couple of times Couple of funny moments
but offset by many other failed jokes<br /><br />In summary, 1. I would rent this to watch on a DVD but not pay to watch
it in the cinema 2. You might enjoy this much more if you were a
prepubescent sci-fi geek 3. IMDb will only be useful as a site to read
a synopsis of a movie but not for its reviews because it looks like
even a $5 production made in the basement of a teenager will get rave 9
star reviews
