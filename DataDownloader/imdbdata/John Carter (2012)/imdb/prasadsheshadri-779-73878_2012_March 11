Set on the distant red planet of Mars, the tale of the eponymous civil
war soldier (Kitsch) caught up in a struggle for freedom and justice is
a natural fit for producers Disney. There&#x27;s the generic
good-versus-evil conflict, sword-and-sorcery-style acrobatics, not to
forget romance with a beautiful warrior-princess (Collins). Evidently
designed to send sci-fi geeks into a tizzy, John Carter serves up an
interminable yarn which fails to fully engage or excite. For all the
running, leaping and fighting, the intrepid superhero&#x27;s exploits are
devoid of energy. The Pixar touch is evident in the precision of the
visual detail and in the wit and energy of Michael Giacchino&#x27;s score,
but the quality control that has been exercised over this project also
has a curiously undermining effect. After all those warning from ppl i
had to try to understand what a $250million waste this was. This movie
is there to stay on the hearts of viewers as one of the most lousiest
ever with great special effects. The movie eagerly sells itself as
semitrashy, almost-campy fun, but it is so lavish and fussy that you
can&#x27;t help thinking that it wants to be taken seriously, and therefore
you laugh at, rather than with, its mock sublimity. Finally, If u are a
fan of Sequel with 6 limbed toys running around in a desert. Well then
this one may interest you.
