When you read the title &#x22;John Carter&#x22; it does not say much. Who is John
Carter? What&#x27;s so special about him? The trailer also does not give you
much hint on what the story is all about. The original story is from
the beginning of the 20th century, however, the movie is neither dull
nor retro. It is a very good movie with a thrilling storyline and good
rhythm. I really enjoyed seeing the origin of familiar Sci-Fi concepts,
as it was drafted over a 100 years ago.<br /><br />Considering the original story spans over several books, the movie
script compacted it pretty nicely, and a friend of mine who read the
books would vouch that it has been packed with relatively few mistakes
or shortcuts. The characters have depth despite the time limitations of
a single movie, and a bits of acting here and there.<br /><br />Of course, the special effects take a significant role in the movie,
but not at the expense of the story. The CGI characters were skillfully
modeled and the interaction with the flesh and blood actor was pretty
&#x22;realistic&#x22;. Yet, one annoying thing is the 3D (at least the version I
saw was 3D), and in my opinion, too many movies were already produced
in 3D or with a 3D version, that it&#x27;s getting tiresome, and it doesn&#x27;t
enhance the experience anymore.<br /><br />I must admit I also enjoyed the landscape scenery, though I have no
idea if it was filmed at a real location or it was computer created.<br /><br />Overall, very pleasant experience.
