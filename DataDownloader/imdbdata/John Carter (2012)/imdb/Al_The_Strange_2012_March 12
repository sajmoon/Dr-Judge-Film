&#x22;John Carter.&#x22; Quick, name some of the best, most fantastic, most
adventurous sci-fi films to date! Chances are that you might name &#x22;Star
Wars,&#x22; &#x22;Avatar,&#x22; &#x22;Stargate,&#x22; &#x22;Flash Gordon,&#x22; &#x22;Buck Rodgers,&#x22; or any
number of other popular or cult hits. If you did, then chances are also
good that they share a common root in sci-fi literature; a
hundred-year-old series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, featuring a
hero named John Carter.<br /><br />After all these years (that is, years of production hell and filming
rights being flip-flopped all over the place), Carter finally hits the
big screen. With today&#x27;s production values and technology, the results
are certainly thrilling. The film moves pretty fast, with maybe just a
few parts of drag. It&#x27;s loaded up with gracious amounts of intense
action, fight scenes, and battles. The special effects are gorgeous.
There are parts that come off as &#x22;pulpy,&#x22; in a manner that could befit
a story in the &#x22;Heavy Metal&#x22; magazine. But above all, everything works
together to form a decent piece of escapism. By the end of the film, I
felt I was effectively immersed in the world of Barsoom (Mars, that is)
and its inhabitants.<br /><br />Most negative reviewers would target the story of this film as being
predictable, uninspired, or convoluted. I don&#x27;t know how close this
movie is to its original book; there are indeed some parts that are
predictable, and the story overall is quite formulaic; but I have no
idea as to whether or not it&#x27;s supposed to be this way. The most
critical viewers expecting ground-breaking storytelling may be
disappointed.<br /><br />Right from the start, the movie establishes itself as something
fantastic (and specifically admonishes the notion that this would be
hard sci-fi; those expecting total scientific accuracy will be
disappointed). Understanding the fantastic nature of this story, there
was never anything about it that hampered my enjoyment; I was able to
follow the story and understand the world it took place in. Characters
are not huge standouts, but I enjoyed watching them. It does its best
to attribute some key themes regarding war and finding a cause to fight
for.<br /><br />The film is pretty well-made, with quality photography. A few shots
appeared to be sloppily-edited, but most of the film is put together
well. Acting is not terribly outstanding, but it&#x27;s not terribly bad
either; I grew to enjoy Taylor Kitsch&#x27;s machismo as John Carter, and
Lynn Collins&#x27; attitude as the princess. Writing is really no better or
worse than most other films. This production has phenomenal sets,
props, costumes, and special effects; I really loved the look and style
of the film. Music is appropriately adventurous.<br /><br />Given the mixed reviews this film has, I can only recommend it as a
rental. But, I do regard it as essential viewing for sci-fi fans.<br /><br />4/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)
