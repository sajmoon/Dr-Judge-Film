2012_March 8 
Just returned from a special screening and if not for the free tickets
I would probably never have watched this. Now that I&#x27;ve sat through the
entire movie (though I had the intention to leave near the end), I&#x27;ve
confirmed my judgment.<br /><br />By no means can I call this a failure of Disney, partly on account of
Disney&#x27;s nature and partly because there aren&#x27;t really obvious errors
to speak of. &#x22;John Carter&#x22; presents itself as a feel-good movie, and
somewhat it is, but everything is just not enough.<br /><br />Having sat through the first 30 minutes or so, the six-lettered word
&#x22;Avatar&#x22; already surfaced, and I knew then that it was going to be hard
to sit till the end. I couldn&#x27;t help having a sense that the movie is
trying to be the new &#x22;Avatar&#x22; (perhaps it&#x27;s just me), a fact which I
instantly realized was impossible, when I thought of the two names
Disney and James Cameron, and made a little comparison (that didn&#x27;t
take long).<br /><br />&#x22;Avatar&#x22; isn&#x27;t my favorite kind of movie, but a part of me was truly
stunned, at least by the visuals. I can&#x27;t say the same for this Disney
fantasy on Pandora (oh wait I forgot it&#x27;s Mars). I have never been much
of a critique of predictability, but I have to admit &#x22;John Carter&#x22;
gives us an average fairy-tale-like childhood story of a prince and a
princess. The short and apparently planned mention of humanity and wars
is not about to save the sorrow of the script. I found it hard to sit
through two whole hours, slight because of, I&#x27;ve got to admit, the fact
that I knew what would happen, but more because I really dislike this
kind of prince-saves-princess-and-marries-her story with seemingly
effortless thinking. It is definitely not a story that loses the
elements of organization and structure, but it is one that is all too
familiar and certainly will not interest a wide array of viewers.<br /><br />And the visual effects, they are good, but not good enough. A dull
desert setting with little beauty to witness really, and visually this
is nothing compared to other fantasy movies like &#x22;Avatar&#x22; and &#x22;Harry
Potter&#x22;. Cinematography is far behind the standard in works like &#x22;War
Horse&#x22;. But I did survive through the IMAX 3D version of the movie, and
I promise it doesn&#x27;t lack action scenes. So if it&#x27;s the intense
fighting and chasing scenes you&#x27;re looking for, you can still go for
it.<br /><br />The pace of the movie seems moderate and reasonable, while the ending
undoubtedly falls flat.<br /><br />If it&#x27;s a fairytale and some action you&#x27;re looking for, this is still
an acceptable choice. But there really isn&#x27;t much more to offer. And
while I&#x27;m still wondering what the US box office of this will be
(expect a sequel if it performs well), I&#x27;m praying that the next big
thing from Disney will be better than this.<br /><br />- dchgl.blogspot.com
