I&#x27;m a big science fiction fan. I should have loved this movie. I never
read the original story, but this should have been epic for what they
spent on it.<br /><br />Two points where this film failed epically and I want to beat the
producers with a hammer until their skulls are split open so zombies
can eat them easier.<br /><br />1) WTF is up with all the jumping? John Carter is not a superhero. He&#x27;s
a human and while the gravity on mars may be different, it&#x27;s not
different to superhuman abilities. Every time he jumped, I just
cringed. That&#x27;s not science fiction, it&#x27;s fantasy. It doesn&#x27;t work. It
looks bad and makes it a superhero movie. The director can go F
himself.<br /><br />2) The wench is amazed by boats on water on earth.... yet 5 minutes
later we have a scene with a boat on water... not exactly amazing to
someone from mars.<br /><br />The movie overall, I liked, these were utter KILLERS for me. I never
wanted John Carter to be a superhero with magic jump abilities like
they portrayed him.<br /><br />He&#x27;s human.... not super.<br /><br />I hope your 250million investment is flushed down the toilet for being
that utterly stupid.
