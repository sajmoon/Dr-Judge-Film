John Carter for me really started out slow,I mean from my expectations
on the trailer I would look at it as a high pumping adrenaline-fueled
movie(which it is,just not in the beginning).But I think its a
sacrifice to listen to(sometimes) lengthy dialog at the start because
it really builds up the story..and it also puts questions on reader&#x27;s
minds about certain key elements which will be explained in the end
which does have a nice twist.. As for the story like I said it start
slow like a train locomotive,but builds and builds until you&#x27;re sucked
in with Carter in the grandeur and epicness of the planet
Barsoom(Mars).The story for me is one of the greatest equalizer in the
film since it has a great story of a man who lost everything and then
trying to redeem himself in an epic way of like...saving a whole
planet?!what you say to that..and of course getting the girl. While the
story is great,the graphics and special effects are bad-ass and the key
factor of the film..the representation of Mars in the film is really
fantastic,epic and beautiful and in the same time dreadful because it
is in the end of its time after all.The CGI rendering of the mars
natives are really mouth,watering and the creatures are spectacular and
pleasing to watch. Overall its a great film but for me,lacks the right
action to really make a stunning impression on the audience.
