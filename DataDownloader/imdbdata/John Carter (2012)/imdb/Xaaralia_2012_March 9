&#x22;John Carter&#x22; is everything I wanted to see in a movie. There is no
deep message to decipher, no social parallels trying to manipulate your
point of view. This movie is a pure, unadulterated action adventure
fest that took me back to a time when movies like &#x22;Jason and the
Argonauts&#x22; and &#x22;The Mysterious Island&#x22; could flood my senses with
thrills, awe, wonder and excitement. In a time when the global audience
has grown into the sophistication of CGI technology in movies, &#x22;John
Carter&#x22; achieves a unique status in my mind: the special effects do not
overpower the story, they enhance it in delightfully skillful way.<br /><br />I read all of the &#x22;John Carter&#x22; books before I was 12 years old. But,
honestly, I don&#x27;t remember much about them. I remember bits and pieces,
but I was much more a fan of E.R. Burroughs &#x22;Tarzan&#x22; books. So,
watching this incarnation of &#x22;John Carter&#x22; was like visiting the
material for the first time...again.<br /><br />To be succinct, &#x22;John Carter&#x22; may not be a &#x27;must see&#x27; movie, but it is
the most thoroughly enjoyable movie I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. Let me
put it another way: the excitement I anticipated for &#x22;Cowboys and
Aliens&#x22; was finally fulfilled by &#x22;John Carter&#x22;. &#x27;Nuff said!
