We just watched John Carter at the cinema and is was far better than
expected. I had hoped it would be good but the reports of attendance at
the box office had not been good, so I went with my 2 sons and an open
mind.<br /><br />Thank goodness we did it was fantastic, I had read the book as a boy
and enjoyed it then, but some 30 or so years later you can never be
sure whether the silver screen will be able to empower what your
recollections were.<br /><br />The story line was good the special effect were great and the action
and the pace were made this a must see movie I could recommend and my
teenage boys were impressed,as well,which is also impressive.<br /><br />Having had $60m spent on marketing this gem, I can only say that I am
not sure the film makers have had their moneys worth yet, if this had
been marketed like a &#x22;Pirates of the Caribbean&#x22; I can&#x27;t help feeling
the clamour to see this film would feverish and queues round the block.
