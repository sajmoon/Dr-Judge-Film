I haven&#x27;t been to a theater-release movie in quite a while, because I
suppose at my age (48) you begin to see the repeat formula in most of
what Hollywood studios create. They all seem alike now, and &#x27;bored&#x27; is
how I exit the theater. I suspect those of us who grew up on Lucas &#x26;
Speilburg are all waiting for the next StarWars. No - Avatar wasn&#x27;t it:
ground-breaking movie visually, but not nearly as expansive a tale.
Enter John Carter. I saw the ad on TV and thought nothing of it.
&#x22;Another clich&#xE9; formula flick thrown together with big CG armies
clashing, and less-than-interesting dialog/story lines going on&#x22; : so I
thought. I was wrong. At the risk of committing great &#x22;blasphemy&#x22;, I
dare say this movie actually had the potential of being *the* next
StarWars. DARN they missed an opportunity! I walked into the theater
barely willing to give this movie (or *any* movie) a chance, so I was
the proverbial &#x22;tough crowd&#x22; - but the acting, visuals, and cool story
drew me in anyway. By the time the wedding scene occurred, I was
thinking &#x27;darn - they rushed this movie -waaay too fast&#x27;. It should
have been 2 movies or possibly a trilogy. I&#x27;m not going to blab on, but
I don&#x27;t post unless a movie is really bad, or really good. This one was
really good, to me, and it kinda grows on you, because instead of
leaving the theater bored, I left thinking about the story. *That* is a
good sign. Film Score: Great! Character development: very good
Directing: very good Acting: very good Story uniqueness: (based on ERB
&#x27;Princess of Mars&#x27; - very good) Visuals: very good!! PS&#x3E; I also did not
look for any &#x22;symbolism&#x22; while watching; just enjoyed the story for
what it was, so if there are political messages in there, I wasn&#x27;t
aware of them.(Sometimes films&#x27; symbolic political messages are rather
&#x27;overt&#x27;, sometimes less overt. I&#x27;d prefer to enjoy a sci-fi adventure
than to be manipulated by politics during a movie. JC of Mars seems to
be straight-forward entertainment w/ no bs.)
