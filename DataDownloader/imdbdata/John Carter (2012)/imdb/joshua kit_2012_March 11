This is a review for &#x22;John Carter&#x22;. It&#x27;s based on the series of books
called &#x22;John Carter of Mars&#x22;. The studio removed &#x22;of Mars&#x22; because they
thought women wouldn&#x27;t want to watch it.<br /><br />Predictably, the film studio has loaded up this review section with
fake reviews and astroturf. <br /><br />John Carter is just another all too familiar example of uninspired
special effects, mediocre acting and a non-existent story.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know how many of these it will take before filmgoers wake up,
but I hope it happens soon.<br /><br />John Carter is a $250 million bomb. Save your hard earned money and
avoid this movie like the plague.
