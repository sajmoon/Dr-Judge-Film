I&#x27;m not the the most prolific of writers but, after much debate, my
children and I went to see John Carter over the weekend - and boy were
we surprised! We were enthralled from start to finish and I was shocked
to realise how long we&#x27;d been sat in the cinema - a testament in
itself. The characters are rich, the special effects are superb, and
even though there are a few flaws in the story line they in no way
detract from the splendour of this epic movie. The ending ties
everything together neatly and I can only hope that we can expect more
from the annals of John Carter. As a parent it was refreshing to watch
something that gripped my attention as solidly as my kids instead of
the normal fluff that is churned out these days. On a closing note, as
the credits began to roll, my daughter glanced over at me with a
fervent look in her eyes and declared: &#x22;Let&#x27;s watch it again!&#x22;
