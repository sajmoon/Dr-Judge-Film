Beautifully designed and impressively directed, this is a thoroughly
enjoyable, emotionally engaging space opera with an intelligent script,
strong characters, terrific special effects and superb performances
from Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins. -Matthew Turner.<br /><br />The movie is a spectacle. It&#x27;s highly entertaining and i am pretty sure
the kids will like it. The trailer was amazing and it had potential to
be come a great VFX movie. I&#x27;m a VFX Junkie. there&#x27;s awesome visual
effects in the movie which everyone will enjoy. especially all the
jumping and fighting. the direction is slightly above average. besides
some corny dialogues and stupid scenes. the movie is usually a fun!
