Why the venerable Disney would spend over US$250mil of their good money
on a science-fiction action adventure set mostly on the Red Planet and
around a protagonist with a name as nondescript as &#x27;John Carter&#x27; was
baffling right from the start, and remains an enigma by the end of this
good-not-great movie. Indeed, a lot rides on a movie with such a hefty
price tag, but given the successful transition that fellow Pixar alum
Brad Bird made into live-action features with last fall&#x27;s &#x27;Mission
Impossible: Ghost Protocol&#x22;, you might think that Andrew Stanton- the
man behind &#x27;Wall E&#x27; and &#x27;Finding Nemo&#x27;- could also make a similarly
triumphant leap.<br /><br />Alas, this big-budget adaptation of the first book- &#x27;Princess of Mars&#x27;-
of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; 11-volume &#x27;Barsoom&#x27; series will likely fulfil
only the most modest of expectations. Like any origin story for a
franchise, &#x27;John Carter&#x27; carries both the promise of an exciting new
vision and the burden of setting things up for future instalments. Not
Stanton nor his two other screenwriters, Mark Andrews and novelist
Michael Chabon, however manage to unshackle the movie from the latter
bugbear, so much so that their film never quite lives up to its
potential.<br /><br />And yes, there is certainly promise in the story of a Confederate
veteran of the American civil war who goes searching for gold in the
Arizona desert and ends up marooned on Mars right in the middle of an
impending war. John Carter is this man, whose mode of interplanetary
transport is a silver medallion he finds in the hands of a Holy Thern
he accidentally kills in a cave on Earth. Once on Mars, John meets a
nomadic tribe of Green Martians known as the Tharks led by the
unusually empathetic Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe). The difference in the
gravitational pull between Earth and Mars results in his ability to
fly, and Tars spares his life in hope of learning his secret.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the two Red Martians- Helium and Zodanga- are at the brink
of a war that could change the fate of Mars forever. The latter&#x27;s
leader, Sab Than (Dominic West), has a secret weapon bestowed by the
Holy Therns, and to save the lives of his citizens, Helium&#x27;s leader
Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds) promises Sab Than his daughter&#x27;s hand in
marriage. Dejah&#x27;s (Lynn Collins) pleas against her arranged marriage
however fall on deaf ears, and her escape from Sab Than and his army
ends fortuitously with a chance meeting with John. So as formula would
dictate, John and Dejah will fall in love while saving the inhabitants
of Helium and consequently the entire Barsoom planet.<br /><br />Well if it isn&#x27;t &#x27;Avatar&#x27; all over again, you say? The answer is both
yes and no. Sure, like &#x27;Avatar&#x27;s&#x27; Jake Sully, John Carter is the
outsider who ends up being the unlikely hero saving a civilisation from
annihilation after landing on an alien planet. But unlike Jake, John
plays the archetype of the reluctant hero that up until two- thirds of
the movie had no intention of saving anyone save for getting back to
Earth and his cave of riches. Does that make John a more interesting
character than Jake?<br /><br />Unfortunately not- in fact, John remains quite one-dimensional despite
a solid lead performance from Taylor Kitsch thanks to unfocused
storytelling. Juggling a multitude of characters and just as many
separate subplots with the Tharks, Zodangas, Therns and Heliums,
Stanton shortchanges his audience&#x27;s desire to understand John&#x27;s
transformation from selfish to selfless, and perhaps to an even greater
extent the romance between John and Dejah that is supposedly the reason
for his change of heart. Stanton&#x27;s attempt to give each of these
Martian tribes enough screen time also backfires- so much so that
significant supporting players like Sab Than, Tardos Mos and the key
villain Matai Shang (Mark Strong) are little more than stock
characters.<br /><br />If &#x27;John Carter&#x27; is weak on story, it is only marginally better in its
action. Any hope for a thrilling mid-air battle between the fliers from
Helium and Zodanga at the beginning is quickly dashed when it is over
far too soon- and the same can be said of the other equally
unremarkable action sequences. Granted that Stanton certainly lacks
James Cameron&#x27;s experience behind the camera, but that&#x27;s scant excuse
for the lack of build-up or excitement in the ostensible money-shots.
Yes, while there is certainly scale in the sheer number of humans or
aliens fighting on screen, these battle scenes do too little to keep
you engaged in the unfolding mayhem. <br /><br />And that&#x27;s just another way in which the film wastes the potential of
its actors. Kitsch is a much more compelling leading man than Avatar&#x27;s
Sam Worthington, but his physicality and his emotional depth are wasted
in a movie that botches both the action and the drama. Lynn Collins
makes a suitably feisty warrior princess, though there are too few
moments in the film to allow Kitsch&#x27;s and Collins&#x27; chemistry to shine
through. Pity the ensemble supporting cast- especially West, Hinds and
Strong- whose characters are so thinly drawn that they are almost
inconsequential.<br /><br />Yet despite its flaws, we must caveat that &#x27;John Carter&#x27; isn&#x27;t the
disaster some pundits have predicted it to be. Those unfamiliar with
Burroughs&#x27; story will find the rich mythology intriguing- though
whether the film satisfies your sense of curiosity at the end is
another matter. Stanton has also made this family-friendly, so younger
kids will be distracted by the gorgeous production design as well as
John&#x27;s irresistibly cute pet beast Woola. But considering the budget
and the talent involved, the fact that it is only a middling
action-adventure is ultimately disappointing. After all, it says a lot
when your impression of John Carter is just as indifferent before and
after two hours of spectacle.
