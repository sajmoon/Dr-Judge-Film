I saw John Carter last night in 3D and for once I was pleasantly
surprised. <br /><br />In short this movie suffers from bad marketing as opposed to the norm
which is normally bad movies marketed really well. <br /><br />Is the film &#x27;great&#x27;? Not really but what it is, is another solid
Science fiction film with some depth and not just action. There are
some really good story telling elements and I have to say there were
some moments I didn&#x27;t pick and that was refreshing as well. The story
did travel quite nicely, except for the start where they tried to ramp
up the gears to get the audience engaged, but that&#x27;s OK. Some of the
highlights for me were:<br /><br />* Unknown lead did a pretty good job and didn&#x27;t come across lame at
all. He was believable as a character and his unusual behaviour at the
start is explained through short bursts of memory which were blended
into the film nicely. * Alien natives weren&#x27;t stupid. Thank god they
didn&#x27;t go the Jaja binks route and make all aliens stupid/funny and
treat humans as the saviours of the world. The natives on this planet
have an established culture, fearless but also have a caring side. They
have wicked looking sniper rifles and are pretty good fighters. They
also generate some funny moments but not at the expense of themselves.
* Leading on from the aliens, the princess of one of the human looking
races is a scientist and early on you get to see her in action with a
sword. She is a strong character with brains and can hold her own in a
fight. So happy they didn&#x27;t dumb her down as well. Good to see a girl
with brains, and also hot. * Scenery and visual affects in 3D. Wow is
the word. I have seen a lot of films in 3D and I always came away
wishing I saw it in 2D. This film was obviously shot for 3D and its
very smooth and every scene utilizes 3D really well. The natives were
unbelievable quality and are done so well you don&#x27;t think of them as
animation or rendered. * There is a nice twist at the end of the film
and almost has a Sherlock Holmes feel to it. It actually made me care
for the character and I was keen to see where the story went. <br /><br />Considering the crowds I saw at films like Phantom Menace, Transformers
etc etc. Its a real shame that this film may go under the radar for a
lot of hardcore sci-fi fans, especially when its so visually stunning
in 3D. You know a film is working when the audience as a whole laugh at
the same spots and &#x27;ooooohhhh&#x27; at the big battle scenes. At the end of
the film my cousin who I saw the film with, told me he was really
surprised at how much he liked it and it was obvious why it costs so
much money. Judging from the comments around us you could tell it was
received well. <br /><br />Its funny how some films have so much hype and end up fizzing out. This
is one film that seems to have no hype and may fizzle out before its
given a chance, shame since its a solid title and a lot of people will
be gutted that they didn&#x27;t see it on the big screen.<br /><br />Summarising I am going to recommend this to all my mates who love
sci-fi and if someone asked me to see it with them I would probably go
again. I guess the best compliment I can give this film is that I was
thinking about it the next day. <br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
