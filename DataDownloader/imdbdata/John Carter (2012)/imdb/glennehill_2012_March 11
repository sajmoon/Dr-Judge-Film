I have to admit having read the books and enjoyed them the movie was a
let down. The books were about a stranger in a strange land like
&#x27;Shogun&#x27; or &#x27;The Last Samurai&#x27;. The writers dumb it down and made it
just another politically correct sci-fi / fantasy action flick with
formulaic plot. The acting was good and Taylor Kitsch was a believable
John Carter. I thought Special effects were very well done. But what
happened to telling a good story with a little edge. Disney had a great
story and threw it out. Disney should never have been allowed to
produce this. HBO should do a series and do it right. If you have not
read the books and interested in being entertained with action pablum,
enjoy. geh
