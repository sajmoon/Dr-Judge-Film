OK. I&#x27;ll do it the other way around as on another movie site: The movie
is nice to watch and the visual effects are good. Hence a 7. BUT I
cannot understand why the infamous Hollywood script writers had to
change so much compared to the book. Now we are left with a story in
which hardly anything is being explained: How can John Carter
understand the Martians? How do the Martians live (especially the green
Tharks)? What kind of a person (&#x22;creature&#x22;) is Dejah Thoris? How are
her thoughts about John Carter? Why do the Heliumites live so different
from the Tharks? How is it possible that on Mars there is air, so that
life is possible at all there? These and many, many other questions
remain unanswered. All these questions are being answered in the book.
Now, why has this information been omitted from the script? Also the
interesting relationship between John Carter and Tars Tarkas remains a
closed book (Why and how do they change from enemies to close
friends?). What remains is a state-of-the-art movie with lots of
action, that is a feast for the eye, but in which much of the
background remains unclear. After writing all this, I have changed my
vote to a six. It is such a shame that the real story remains untold.
