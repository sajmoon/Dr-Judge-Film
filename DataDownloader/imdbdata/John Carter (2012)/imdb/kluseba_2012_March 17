John Carter is a solid and entertaining science-fiction movie. It
convinces with a good dose of visually stunning special effects for the
movie theatres without being too visual and overwhelming as other
recent blockbusters such as &#x22;Avatar&#x22;.<br /><br />Another strong point is the humour in this movie when John Carter first
meets the Tharks or when he is strolling around with the giant alien
dog that follows him everywhere. As these humorous parts are very
strong, the movie should have even focused more on them.<br /><br />A good point is the acting in the movie that fits well to this movie
genre and creates some credible characters as the mysterious Therns,
the courageous and suffering Sola or John Carter himself whose
struggles are explained in the beginning of the movie and several well
done flashbacks. In fact, the first and last moments of the movie
perfectly close the circle and are very addicting as they don&#x27;t play on
Barsoom but in the late nineteenth century in the United States of
America.<br /><br />The movie also has some weaker parts. First of all, the story is
overall rather predictable including the usual stranger in a strange
land becoming a hero scenario. Of course, this movie is an adaption of
parts of the three first Barsoom novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs that
have been written almost one hundred years ago and have surely been
quite original at their time. In fact, this movie makes me want to read
these old classics one day. But the scenarists of the movie should have
changed a couple and given these story a more modern, surprising and
twisted touch. In fact, we have a weird letdown between a top notch
production and an old school story. There are more negative things to
say about the story. There are some plot holes of course but what I
miss the most are some background informations. Why exactly was Sab
Than chosen to be the most powerful person on the planet and obtains
the special weapon of almost total destruction? Where do the Therns
exactly come from and what are their purposes? What&#x27;s the point of the
ninth ray that Dejah Toris is about to discover? Many mysteries are
left unexplained.<br /><br />Another rather weak point are the fighting scenes that are only based
on special effects and not truly impressing. The choreography of the
battles is rather ordinary and not always logically elaborated. On one
side, John Carter kills giant white Martian apes as well as the
powerful and vicious Tal Hajus or a whole company of Therns and the
Green Men of Warhoon by the sword, on the other side he heavily
struggles in some battles and must be helped by a princess or some
associates in the beginning and end of the movie.<br /><br />In the end, the weaker points are not excessive and maybe more
explanations will follow in the upcoming sequels if this movie is
successful enough. What we have here are more than two hours of great
entertainment with strong visual effects, sympathetic characters and a
lot of action, passion and tension. Of course, this is the kind of
movie that is produced by Disney and created for the whole family and
might not please to those who expect a more brutal, complex or
emotional story line but it&#x27;s nevertheless a very enjoyable ride and I
would definitely watch this movie again. Imagine a mixture of &#x22;Avatar&#x22;,
&#x22;Dune&#x22; and &#x22;Prince Of Persia&#x22; and you should quite know what you get
delivered in here.
