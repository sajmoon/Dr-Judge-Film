Wow. So, I already went into the movie with high hopes. I knew it
wouldn&#x27;t be recognized by most people, and knew it wouldn&#x27;t have a huge
audience on opening night. But seriously, this movie didn&#x27;t disappoint.
Really did have superb acting, a great story (yeah, there is actually a
high budget movie with amazing special effects that has a plot), and a
great soundtrack. I think that everything about this movie was great.
Great action as well. Totally underrated at this point. If you&#x27;re
looking for a great sci fi action/adventure film, you must see this
one. Seriously one of the best films to come out in the past couple of
years.
