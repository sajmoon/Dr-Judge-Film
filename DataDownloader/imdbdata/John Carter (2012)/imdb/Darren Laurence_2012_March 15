It&#x27;s hard not to compare this film to Avatar which I have to say, is
not usually my kind of film, however, I absolutely loved it. Avatar,
not John Carter that is. I mean, why call a film John Carter in the
first place? You&#x27;re kinda asking for trouble if you ask me!<br /><br />I won&#x27;t bother boring you with the over complicated plot but I will
start with the characters. I felt exactly the same about the characters
in PS I Love You, &#x26; Leap Year, i.e.: if a bomb exploded and killed them
off I wouldn&#x27;t of cared, well, expect for the speedy frog of course, he
was the only decent character in the film.<br /><br />I don&#x27;t know anything about the Princess book it was taken from but the
minute she appears on screen you already know the ending. OK, so she&#x27;s
hot, if a little old to be a princess.<br /><br />For a Disney film I was completely surprised by the lack of magic and
beauty. OK, so the CGI was good, but it&#x27;s become so boring now that you
need something else, (Avatar and it&#x27;s amazing 3d).<br /><br />The film is totally pointless. John Carter or Virgina as he is known by
the green men jumps around loads, so what. I know it&#x27;s fantasy but I
couldn&#x27;t help thinking what a bloody stupid film this really is. It&#x27;s
like Flash Gordon minus the camp and cool soundtrack.<br /><br />I&#x27;m still not sure who this film is aimed at. I&#x27;d actually put it up
there with one of the worst films I&#x27;ve ever seen, just behind PS I Love
You.<br /><br />Maybe I&#x27;m too cynical, but don&#x27;t bother doing a 3d movie and charging
more unless it&#x27;s actually in 3d movie!
