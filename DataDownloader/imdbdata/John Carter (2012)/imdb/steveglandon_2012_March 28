Went with low expectations what with all the talk of the movie bombing
at the box office. Do not understand why folks are staying away from
this flick. JC is an epic science-fi action flick with great
imagination. The movie is well scripted, well acted, beautiful on the
big screen, 3d that fits the movie well and not used at all to shock
viewers. It will almost certainly be out of theatres soon, so go asap
for the 3d and digital experience. Too bad this is the end of the line
for this story. When I think about other movie franchises with really
crappy movies that stay alive, like Star Wars, well let&#x27;s just say it
ain&#x27;t fair.
