First Let me tell you what John Carter is not: 1.Its not the worst
movie of this decade as reviewers suggest. 2.Its not an action movie(if
you are hoping it to be of Action genre,then you are going to be
disappointed. 3.Its story isn&#x27;t that complex(If you want to be
cautious,just go through its wikipedia page before watching the movie.
4.Its not a Box Office Bomb type movie,far from it. 5.Its not inspired
by Star Wars,Avatar etc ,this movie&#x27;s story(released way back in 1917)
inspired Flash Gordon,star wars,Avatar,Superman etc<br /><br />Now Let me tell you what John Carter movie really is: 1.Its a nice
scifi movie faithful to the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s novel &#x22;A
Princess of Mars&#x22; 2.It got a good combination of humor and
twist/suspense. 3.Treat it as a pure Scifi and Adventure Movie, nothing
else.Then You wont be disappointed. 4.A scifi fan like me enjoyed this
movie and I was able to keep track of plot with no difficulty contrary
to other critic&#x27;s suggestion. 5.I had somehow mixed expectation after
reading numerous negative reviews.But to my joy/hope it pretty much
exceeded my expectations. 6.CGI is very good but not a match for
Avatar.<br /><br />This is a good (not great) movie with some slow portion mixed with nice
twists, good humor and some good action scenes.If a sequel is made(??)
I will definitely watch it.<br /><br />If You agree with my points the you should give this movie a chance.
