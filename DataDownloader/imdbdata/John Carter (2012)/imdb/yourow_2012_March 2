That&#x27;s not to say this movie used ideas from all these films, but the
reverse. The movie is based on the book, &#x27;A Princess of Mars&#x27;, by Edgar
Rice Burroughs which is 100 years old this year.<br /><br />I was lucky to get tickets to the premier in London at the BFI. The
cast was there and after the movie the director came on stage for a
Q&#x26;A.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the movie as a piece of escapism, I just found that I
couldn&#x27;t fully engage with the characters. The storyline was difficult
to follow: Who were the Martians and why did they look exactly like
humans? Why did the the other species (the Tharks) look so alien? What
was the war about and how did the shape shifting astral travellers fit
into the story? There were some brief explanations but nothing
convincing. The world created wasn&#x27;t fully complete: What food is
eaten, where is it grown, where do they get water, how do they make
their flying machines, houses, clothes, etc. etc . . . This
civilisation didn&#x27;t look like it could exist in this barren landscape.
There was nothing anything could be made from. I may have to read the
book to get an understanding of the film plot.<br /><br />Having said that, it was very nicely shot, the CGI was convincing and
it was fun.<br /><br />The 3D didn&#x27;t really add to the experience. Halfway through the film, I
no longer noticed it was in 3D (but I was sitting at the far left edge
of the cinema, might have been better if I was in the centre).
