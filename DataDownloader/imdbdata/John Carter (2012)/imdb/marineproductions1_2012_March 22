I saw the trailer, meh... then I saw the 10min footage. I realized this
film is much more than what this trailer is showing me and I have to go
see it. Then I told my friends I&#x27;m gonna go see it. They said don&#x27;t see
it. I said why? They said, there&#x27;s bad review. I asked them did you see
it? None of them said they did. I said the footage looked really good,
so... ...I went to the theater. ...AND... This film is soooo good some
of the scenes even made me cry. The director/writer truly understand
story and what touches the audience&#x27;s hart. All I can say is it has a
stunningly beautiful story!!!! It&#x27;s wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better than avatar!
Not a lot of manufactored 3D junk movies have stories. And this one
does! It&#x27;s a rare film a masterpiece. Such a great film that I haven&#x27;t
seen for a long time!!! Go watch it! Don&#x27;t listen to the non-sense
reviews! <br /><br />Also make a different trailer! Don&#x27;t show the bombing CGI scenes; put
in the artistic storytelling scenes instead. Because the stronghold of
this movie is not CGI but story. All the CGI (which is also fantastic)
works for the purpose of the story. <br /><br />I&#x27;ll be losing my hope on the sanity of the American audience if this
movie flops because it&#x27;s such a great film I haven&#x27;t seen in a LONG
TIME, since INCEPTION of 2010!!!!<br /><br />The design is fantastically apt to the film. The effect is as good as
Avatar. The story is way better than Avatar. There are moments that
made me cry in the theater. Director/Writer really know how to write
good scenes and good plots and cut them together for the best cinematic
experience that touches audience. The pacing is very good. A very well-
done take of John Carter. But only a score of 7ish? and only 180M box
office up till I wrote this review out of a budget of 250M? Many other
3D junk movies did better. This 3D movie has a truly marvellous story
and a world view and cinematic story telling that touches and deserve a
much better rating and much better receive.<br /><br />In my opinion this film deserves a rating around 8.5 and more. And
should get more than 500M in box office.
