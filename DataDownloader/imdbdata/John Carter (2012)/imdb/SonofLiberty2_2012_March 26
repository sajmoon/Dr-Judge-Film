First of all, I was never a fan of Burroughs&#x27; novels....until recently.
Seeing the first trailer for this movie spurred me to finally read A
Princess of Mars and the second in the series, The Gods of Mars. I was
intrigued with Burroughs&#x27; ability to mix science fiction with adventure
in a way that Jules Vernes simply could not match. Now, for the movie,
I thought it was an excellent adaptation. While it is not a word for
word adaptation of the book, it is faithful enough to thrill both old
time fans of Burroughs, and be very enjoyable for newcomers to the
world of Barsoom. This truly is the root of all modern space epics. The
plot, the effects, and the pace of the film will surprise you at how
fast 2 hours can go by. As to the detractors of the film.....see it
first. There is far more science here than fiction. Nanotechnology,
fusion, and whispers of Tesla throughout the film go unnamed but are
there for those who understand their basic premises. Burroughs,
somewhere in eternity, may yet have the last laugh when we someday
visit Mars and began to closely study its past.
