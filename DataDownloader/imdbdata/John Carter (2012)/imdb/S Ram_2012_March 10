I saw the IMDb rating of 6.8 and decided to watch this movie. Boy, was
I mistaken. It looks like most of the positive reviews for this movie
are paid for by the movie producers.<br /><br />The movie has a weird story that is very difficult to follow. The
special effects are good here and there although this certainly looks
like a B grade movie that doesn&#x27;t even come close to Avatar.<br /><br />If you are going to watch this thinking that you are going to get an
avatar like experience, just forget about it. It is not worth it at all
in my opinion, avatar like or not.<br /><br />Disney has definitely disappointed with this movie.
