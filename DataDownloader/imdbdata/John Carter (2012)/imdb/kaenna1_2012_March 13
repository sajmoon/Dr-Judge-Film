John Carter was surprisingly better than I expected. If someone calls
this Avatar-lite, that might be because Avatar is in fact somewhat
based on the Barsoom novels by E.R. Burroughs. There were a few issues
with stock characterization, but it has a great, multi-layered plot,
good graphics, and more than decent action sequences. One thing that I
did not like, was the pointless 3D conversion. Completely unnecessary
means of getting more money from patrons as it did not add anything.
There is a lot that is left unanswered in the film, and it&#x27;s a good
thing. Watching the film left me asking &#x22;Why?&#x22; but out of curiosity,
not frustration. You leave the theater wanting more of that rich,
adventure-filled world. Made me want to read the books.
