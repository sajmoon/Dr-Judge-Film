John Carter, a film standing tall in effects,direction and all but
lacks soul of a movie i.e. a strong story. It is almost like every
other movie which falls short on expectations from a Disney movie (at
least I keep great expectations).Movie failed miserably on my
expectation as without a strong story all efforts in making a great
movie go in drain. Suspense at the end was good but story seemed to be
fragmented and loosely joined. I guess, actors failed to get enough
space to show their acting talent in all this chaos of out of the world
special effect.Many characters, incidents and events failed to create
their unique purpose &#x26; contribution in movie and appeared more like
just being stuffed in to appear full.
