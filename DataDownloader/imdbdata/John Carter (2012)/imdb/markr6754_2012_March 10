I read the entire Mars series from Edgar Rice Burroughs as a new teen
in the late 1960s. Having re-discovered the stories as e-books, I
re-read them all over again 3 years ago. Needless to say, I couldn&#x27;t
wait for the opportunity to see this high-budget rendition of the first
book A Princess of Mars. I began to worry as the early reviews came in
from the &#x22;experts&#x22;. After all, this hardly fits into the standard fare
released from Disney studios.<br /><br />As an avid Burroughs fan I made it a priority to make this movie the
first ever theatre visit on opening night. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. No
need to say anything about the storyline, the plot, the acting, or the
special effects. It&#x27;s all already been said. I just wanted to add my
voice, and my vote, to the tally of what I hope will become the first
or many of the Mars series to come.....and then we can move on to
Carson of Venus. But first things first. I was enthralled from the
opening scene. It&#x27;s probably the fastest 2+ hours I&#x27;ve ever spent in my
life. I barely budged from my seat...including waiting through every
second of the closing credits.<br /><br />Kudos, applause....already planning my next viewing....only this time
I&#x27;ll definitely spring for 3-D. Awesome. Thank you Disney. Do it again.
