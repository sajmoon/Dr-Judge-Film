2012_March 7 
I don&#x27;t watch trailers, as they usually contain either best scenes of a
movie or a huge amount of spoilers. so I watched the movie tonight, and
I have to say, it was not what I expected it to be. if you are
expecting a 300 movie here then no, this is more like Thor. <br /><br />IMDb should add &#x22;comedy&#x22; as a genre to the movie. if there was any
potential of a great story or great fights then it was lost with
overuse of comedy. Also, it seems like the Director or the Editor loves
using the Tilt Shift very often, that he overused it on most of the
scenes in the movie.<br /><br />I gave it 6/10 for its potential, I might have given it more If I
entered the show with the intention of watching a comedy film, but no I
was expecting a brutal experience with a well put story, like most of
the people are.
