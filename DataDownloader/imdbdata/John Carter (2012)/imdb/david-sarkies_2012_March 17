It looks like this movie flopped, which is a shame because it wasn&#x27;t
really a bad movie. It wasn&#x27;t a great movie either, but it really did
not deserve to flop the way it did (it cost $250mill to make and made
only $30mill on the opening weekend). The funny thing was that
throughout the movie I just felt that there was something missing and
that it seemed somewhat familiar. It was not until I got to the end of
the movie that I almost screamed out &#x27;Flash Gordon&#x27;. Okay, it is not
Flash Gordon, and Flash Gordon probably borrowed ideas from the
original novel, but it did not seem to be all that original.<br /><br />This film is based on the book by Edgar Rice Burroughs called &#x27;Princess
of Mars&#x27;. Now some have suggested that pretty much all science-fiction
since has been based upon these series of books, but I would suggest
otherwise. Burroughs was not the first to write Science-fiction, and
while I consider Jules Verne to be the father of science-fiction, it is
really Mary Shelley (in collaboration with her husband Percy Shelley)
that really set the foundations of modern science-fiction. Even them,
numerous authors before them (Lucian of Samotosa for instance) have
written stories about journeys to the moon.<br /><br />It beginning of the movie confused me a bit, and I got a little bored
waiting for John Carter to get to Mars. However it turns out that the
events at the beginning (despite me dozing off and having to try and
work out what is going on) is important to the end. However it was
quite unnecessary. As it turns out, the bookends of the movie seem to
have been rushed and forced through, as a lot of other parts of the
movie. I found the method of Carter getting to Mars a little odd
(though it is explained a bit later, but not fully) and was confused as
to why Burroughs appears. I actually found the appearance of Burroughs
to be somewhat contrived, as if his stories are based on the
autobiography of John Carter. It also seemed that after all is said and
done, and we can sit back and say that he has succeeded (and got the
girl) the movie suddenly throws us into a further plot. As I said
previously, it was simply not necessary.<br /><br />However, please don&#x27;t let these gripes put you off what is a really
good movie. This movie is for anybody that loves science-fiction and
loves alien civilisation. It was the civilisation that I simply loved.
The setting is late 19th century with John Carter a former Civil War
officer who has walked away from the corps having been disgusted with
its attitudes. At one point he is staring down a group of apaches and
the cavalry, not wanting to provoke either side, but the trigger happy
cavalry do the job for him. However when we get to Mars we see a wasted
landscape full of ruined cities inhabited by aliens, some human, others
not. We have flying ships, but designed to look closer to a
science-fantasy setting of the late 19th century. I had heard of these
books, and these flying ships, but had never seen anything close to
this outside of Doctor Who and Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. This is a
good movie, and those who like science-fiction, should really give it a
go.
