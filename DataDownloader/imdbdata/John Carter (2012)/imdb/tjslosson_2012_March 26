I went to this movie looking for an ordinary action flick but what I
got was a lot more. Overall it was a good story, good acting, with some
surprises along the way, and the movie kept me interested from start to
finish. Admittedly there were parts of the movie that reminded me of
the star-wars prequels i.e. silly characters (like the dog) or hard
characters being forced to do things that make them look silly but
unlike star-wars these scenes didn&#x27;t feel forced or out of place they
felt genuinely like they belonged in the movie.<br /><br />I had one problem with one unexplained plot twist that needed to be
explained or revamped but it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me.
