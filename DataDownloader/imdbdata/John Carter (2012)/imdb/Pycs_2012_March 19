The more I think about &#x27;John Carter&#x27;, the more I see the similarities
between it and &#x27;Avatar&#x27;. Both films are huge-budgeted, ambitious
science fiction films that seem to showcase to much beautiful CGI (boy,
does that feel weird to say), rather than tell an all too original and
compelling story.<br /><br />Now, before you think too yourself that I was not aware that this was
based on a book, you&#x27;re wrong. I understand that the book was written
in 1912 (which is incredibly ahead of its time), and many, many science
fiction films and stories have borrowed elements (such as &#x27;Avatar.&#x27;)I
wish it would have just given us something new. The princess story is
clich&#xE9;d and predictable, the main characters journey from foreigner to
hero has been done many times before, the villains who seem to lack any
sort of motivation doesn&#x27;t help matters for that fact as well.<br /><br />Is it visually appealing? Of course. It&#x27;s beautiful. Gorgeous.
Stunning. But as a complete story, does it make coherent sense and is
paced well? No. Not at all.<br /><br />I&#x27;d recommend for big sci-fans to check it out, they won&#x27;t be
disappointed. As for the average viewer, waiting until it&#x27;s able to
rent is the way to go.
