Having waited the best part of a half century for a version of ERB&#x27;s
Barsoomian series to be worthy of the name, this latest version by
Andrew Stanton hits the nail on the head.<br /><br />Every movie necessarily changes stories to make them fit the screen and
meet time formats. What Stanton is done is to capture the heart and
soul of what made ERB&#x27;s world sing and made it memorable for a century,
not by slavishly following the course of one or another of the books,
or by violating the &#x22;laws&#x22; of its universe, but by re-translating it
and making it work for &#x22;now&#x22;.<br /><br />What shines forth from the story is nobleness and baseness of human
nature, the spiritual center of all of ERB&#x27;s work. This is the theater
of the mythic center of our being, the center that transcends the
rationality and ultimately mundane &#x22;real&#x22; world that time forces us to
live in.<br /><br />Take a bit of your mundane time and step up on a broader stage. You
will be glad you did.
