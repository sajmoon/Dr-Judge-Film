This movie is not great but it&#x27;s not bad either.<br /><br />The real reason why this movie is doing so unbelievably bad at the box
office, actually, to be honest, it has nothing at all to do with it
being a good movie or with it being a bad movie, it is something
different.<br /><br />Marketing! Nobody knows what this movie is about or who John Carter is
or why we should care. I didn&#x27;t know it was supposed to be on Mars
even. I don&#x27;t know anything about the story and I think most people are
like my in that area.<br /><br />With all the posters, commercials etc why did they never say what the
story was or who this guy is? I&#x27;m supposed to know about a sci-fi book
from the 1900&#x27;s? Get real, the marketing on this movie is maybe the
worst ever.<br /><br />Anyway the story is okay (better than Avatar but still kind of basic
and thin) but the effects really are tremendous, if you like effects
then I definitely would say you should go see this movie while you can
in 3D which might not be for long because the rate this movie is
flopping it will be pulled from theaters at any minute, wish I was
joking.
