This film is not recommended.<br /><br />My first official film for the 2012 movie season is the new Disney
film, John Carter, not to be confused with the 50&#x27;s stand-up comedian
Jack Carter, who was slightly more entertaining. Based on Edgar Rice
Burroughs&#x27; Barsoom series that dates back to 1912, ( a source with
which I was not at all familiar ), the film is as old-fashion as the
pulp fiction dime store novels of its days and just as fresh as three
day old tuna. <br /><br />After a short prologue about the planet Mars, or Barsoom as it&#x27;s known
by the natives, the film begins in the early 1880&#x27;s. We first meet a
young Edgar B., nephew to his Uncle Jack ( again, not the comic ).
Edward, or Ned, is attending his dear late uncle&#x27;s funeral where he
receives a journal that tells of John Carter&#x27;s life and otherworldly
adventures. We again flash back to 1868, where we meet a young virile
Carter (Taylor Kitsch ), a loner prospecting for gold, fighting
Apaches, and Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca out West. ( It is at this point that I
became discombobulated. Had I walked in Cowboys and Aliens, that recent
sub-par hybrid of the Western and sci-fi genres? Hasn&#x27;t Hollywood
learned from that bomb? I must admit here that a gnawing feeling of
d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu pervaded this film throughout my viewing displeasure, as I
became inundated with countless variations to other sci-fi / fantasy
adventure films. ) <br /><br />Anyway, John is finally transported to Mars and taken prisoner by the
Tharks, a tribe of green four-armed, 10-foot tall creatures ruled by
Tars Tarkas ( Willem Dafoe ). ( Shades of Avatar, sans the blues? )
Just as on Earth, there is a civil war brewing, only here it&#x27;s between
the Tharks and the Therns, a reddish henna colored tattooed group of
warriors who now have a special weapon of mass destruction called the
Ninth Ray. ( Well, life can get confusing on Barsoom or Mars,
especially if you suffer from a speech impediment, but at least, your
enemy is color-coded.) One of the villains of the story is Sab Than
(Dominic West ) who is scheduled to marry the Princess of Helium, Dejah
Thoris (Lynn Collins ), a feisty Xena-like no-nonsense warrior princess
type. ( Now at this point, I would have loved this character to speak
in a high-pitched squeaky voice. Jennifer Tilly would have been a
perfect choice. It could have been such campy fun to poke some humor
into this bag of hot air, trying to evoke some originality and
light-hearted fantasy instead of settling for this light-headed variety
of sci-fi silliness, but alas, this purported blockbuster remains
deadly serious. Too serious for its own good. Not to mention, I felt
another gnawing sensation of yet another film of far superior quality
about another gallery far, far away featuring a two-bunned princess
named Leia. )<br /><br />And the bloated plot continued with still more villains: Matai Shang (
Mark Strong ), Tal Hajus ( Thomas Haden Church ); more battles and CGI
creatures; and even a gladiator contest with two Albino Martian apes
for the Roman Gladiator movie-going crowd. Plus, I forgot to mention
Carter&#x27;s ability to jump high, leap for miles, and land many killer
punches for all the kiddies to enjoy. ( A further example of ripping
off another equally dull and unsuccessful film caller Jumper and the
more successful Spiderman franchise. )<br /><br />Yes, there is much action on the screen and director Andrew Stanton
tries to sustain some degree of excitement in this fanboy adventure.
But the film is an exercise in futility, a three- ring circus
extravaganza, visually colorful but as bland as our hero&#x27;s non-descript
name and just as silly as any comic book hero. The film suffers from
poor pacing as it lumbers from one adventure to the next. Major script
changes were needed in the pre-production stage. Some serious editing
decisions were also necessary in post production. ( It takes almost
twenty minutes until the real outer space theme even kicks in. ) It
also doesn&#x27;t help matter that Taylor Kitsch is so one-dimensional,
lackluster, and unappealing as the main studly hero. He sadly lives up
to his surname. Major miscasting here.<br /><br />All the fictionalized and convoluted mythology doesn&#x27;t make the film
any nobler or grander in scale. The film&#x27;s heavy-handed approach only
make John Carter more of an epic failure at the box office rather than
from a creative standpoint. Which is a shame because the film still
marginally entertains, like the old Flash Gordon Saturday morning
serials. Critics seemed to punish this film version because of its big
expensive budget and lavish decors, but the visuals do have some nice
details. One does get their money&#x27;s worth, visually speaking. And in
retrospect, perhaps Burroughs was one of the first authors to develop
this fantasy angle that other modern day writers and filmmakers have
since picked dry and left its sorry carcass behind.<br /><br />John Carter may not be the ultimate success that Disney aspired to
attain. But it has a retro vibe that still will transport the younger
members of the audience to enjoy a rousing good time spent with Uncle
Jack and the Martians. It&#x27;s the older mature moviegoers whose
expectations may be Therned, I mean, thwarted, and they will want to
say, &#x22;No Tharks&#x22;, I mean, &#x22;No, Thanks!&#x22;. GRADE: C NOTE: Leaps of Logic:
Why did the Therns speak fluent English and not have a native subtitled
language on Mars like the Tharks? Why could John breathe so
effortlessly on Mars?
