This is the first review that I&#x27;m writing in my life. All i have to say
is that its disappointing. From the director who gave us Finding Nemo,
Toy Story and Wall E, Andrew Stanton really messed it up. Looks like he
should stick to animation. On the positive note, the visuals are really
good. Somehow the screenplay was really dragging. Its not the story
that is new. Very very predictable and at the end of it I just couldn&#x27;t
wait for the movie to get over. And yes, why is the movie in 3-d?
Anyways I&#x27;m just speaking for myself. If you have enough time to waste
please go and watch it. My conclusion - Not worth spending your little
over 2 hrs.
