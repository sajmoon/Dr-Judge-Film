I have been a fan of the books and comics for 30+ years and went in
with high expectations. I must say I was not disappointed at all. I
thought a great job was done on this movie. It did seem to combine some
of the elements of the 1st two books with a bit of a twist. As a fan of
the novels I really feel like Andrew Stanton did this film justice. The
only reason I see this film not doing well as is the lack of
advertising. Otherwise my wife and I really enjoyed this and hope there
are plans for a second film. Visual effects were stunning as well. If
not for the high cost of movies I would see this one again. This says a
lot as I grew up in the era when you went to see a movie more than
once. I would give this 2 thumbs up. Very pleasantly surprised!!!!! :)
