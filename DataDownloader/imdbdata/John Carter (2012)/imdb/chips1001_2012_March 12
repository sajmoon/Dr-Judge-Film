John Carter is definitely going to be on this years flop list. With a
high budget of $250million you really expect better. <br /><br />What did John Carter do right? Well the visuals were great, the CGI for
the aliens from Mars was good, only complaint I had was watching the
movie in 3D looked as if the people weren&#x27;t very rounded and didn&#x27;t
really look part of the movie, it looked more as if the people were cut
out and stuck on to some sandy background... yeah that&#x27;s all John
Carter did right in my opinion and even that could have been improved,
Avatar had the same budget but the effects looked better but this is
understandable due to the sandy background John Carter had, while
Avatar had different vivid colours and lets not forget James Cameron is
an amazing director.<br /><br />So you&#x27;re thinking where did John Carter go wrong. Well the story never
really got going it wasn&#x27;t very interesting until the ending of the
movie which was decent. The action scenes in this movie were terrible,
for a movie which is claiming to be a action/adventure it didn&#x27;t
deliver with the action at all as they didn&#x27;t get you on the edge of
your seat of make you think &#x22;Wow!&#x22; to yourself once. Taylor Kitch
acting wasn&#x27;t great either how he just suddenly learns how to walk when
he can&#x27;t control his weight on a different planet was just odd.<br /><br />I&#x27;d give John Carter a 4/10 just for its good visuals and its ending
even though the climax of the movie didn&#x27;t really come.
