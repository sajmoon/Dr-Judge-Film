I saw this film after having read several of the books by chance a few
months ago and was extremely excited when I heard that they were to be
made into a film. I went to see the film yesterday despite the critics&#x27;
reviews and must say that I was absolutely amazed. The film had
succeeded in translating the book to the screen and several points that
were ambiguous in the book had even become clarified. The special
effects were incredible and John Stanton had done an excellent job of
bringing Edgar Rice-Burroughs&#x27; Martian landscapes and visions to the
screen. I have no idea why this film was slammed by critics. It is a
highly enjoyable visual experience and one that has obviously been made
with love and dedication. If you are a science fiction fan and also
love big budget 3D action, please go and see this film. Ignore the
critics and listen to your heart. It is well worth the ticket money,
particularly in Imax 3D. I only wish a sequel could be in the works.
