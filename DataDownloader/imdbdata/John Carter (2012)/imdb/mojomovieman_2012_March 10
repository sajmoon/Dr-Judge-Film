Saw this today despite the reviews posted all over the Internet. I went
in with the idea that it would be a bad movie, lame effects and just a
waste of a Saturday afternoon. Why did I go you ask? Because I loved
the John Carter books since I was a child picking them up at garage
sales. <br /><br />You&#x27;ve read enough reviews from people to know the story. John Carter,
a Civil War veteran, is in search of gold in the Arizona territory and
transported to Mars to becomes deeply involved in another civil war
between two Martian races. There are some twists, some turns, some
obvious plot holes and some serious corniness throughout the movie.<br /><br />With all this in mind, did I like the movie? Heck yeah I did! I saw the
3D version and glad I did. The CG and special effects were phenomenal.
When you can watch a 3D movie, and get immersed into the world (such as
Avatar,) you quickly forget the sometimes lame dialog and just watch
and enjoy.<br /><br />The movie is entertaining. There is never a point that you are checking
your iPhone under seat level or looking for that last kernel of popcorn
in your bag. The on location shots were beautiful and if the only think
you know about John Carter is that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote it, you
will be surprised at a couple of twists in the story. Don&#x27;t pay
attention to the critics&#x27; destruction of this movie, just go see it
with an open mind and I guarantee you will be pleasantly entertained.<br /><br />Another plus - new previews for The Avengers and MIB 3 - in 3D!
