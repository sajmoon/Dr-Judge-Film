First of all, I&#x27;m very disappointed with the critics or news-makers
that said this is a bad movie, that Disney made a wrong move to
green-lit this movie that flop in the States. They almost made me did
not go to the cinema to watch this and obviously they didn&#x27;t watch the
movie and just report something based on someone else&#x27;s opinion.<br /><br />I am truly satisfied to watch this movie and It&#x27;s been awhile since I
felt this way after watching something in a cinema. I&#x27;m truly glad that
I follow my instinct that this movie was very good. The special effects
were good and enough to make to story moves forward.<br /><br />This is a kind of Sci-Fi movie that was not scared to establish and
flesh out the characters in it without being boring. It&#x27;s making me
understood the characters way of thinking and the reason they did what
they did in the movie. Although the story comes from a source that
preceded Star Wars, Dune, Avatar and every other Sci-Fi movies but this
doesn&#x27;t feel old. It feels significant and like a totally new world
that I can enjoy.<br /><br />John Carter&#x27;s adventure while he was still on Earth and transported to
Mars and back again makes my want to see more of his adventure and the
continuation of this story. So please Disney, I plead you to make a
sequel of this movie. Don&#x27;t give up on this gem!! And also to ones who
read this and haven&#x27;t seen this movie go out to the cinema quick and
enjoy the experience. I know I did. My family did ^_^
