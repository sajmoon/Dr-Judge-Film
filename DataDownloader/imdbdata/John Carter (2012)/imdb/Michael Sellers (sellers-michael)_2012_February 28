Star Wars, Avatar, and John Carter. That&#x27;s the cinema progression
although by now everyone knows that the John Carter books came first
and inspired both Lucas and Cameron. As a devotee of the books -- I
appreciated Star Wars and Avatar, but neither produced the level of
excitement and reader/viewer loyalty that Edgar Rice Burroughs did with
his vivid and unforgettable tales of John Carter, Dejah Thoris, and
Barsoom.<br /><br />So what has Andrew Stanton given us?<br /><br />Anwer: A gem that shines bright and true with a light all its own.
Stanton has taken the grandmaster&#x27;s story but he&#x27;s made it his own and
it&#x27;s fresh and emotionally stirring in ways that are unexpected and
make you want to see it a second time, and soon. The gem is not without
a few rough edges -- but the core brilliance is unmistakable and
undeniable.<br /><br />Stanton is a subtle and sophisticated storyteller with a Pixarian&#x27;s
understanding of how to build characters that stay with you. Whereas
Cameron in Avatar was content to extract the simple essence of the
Burroughsian pulp narrative and just &#x22;go with it&#x22;, Stanton keeps enough
of that to keep the material recognizable but constructs characters
that, in deft and certain strokes, emerge as fully realized beings who
engage us and draw us in to their stories in ways that exceed what his
predecessors Burroughs, Lucas, and Cameron were able to do. The result
is a richer, character driven experience that transcends the dear sweet
old pulpy fiber on which it is based and becomes something grander,
richer, and more satisfying.<br /><br />A word about how the film differs from what you&#x27;re seeing in trailers:
The promotion promises spectacle and action and there is plenty of
that; but the promotion also suggests that the film will be a kind of
childishly simple, woodenly executed mashup of questionable seriousness
featuring awkward performances and cartoonish characterization while
the film itself is almost the inverse of that--a thoughtful, finely
tune spectacle that is a feast of imaginative transport and whose few
flaws flow from the fact that it&#x27;s a three hour epic that plays in two
hours and twelve minutes.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch is convincing and natural and I never thought I&#x27;d be
saying that, based on the promotion. Lynn Collins is luminous and
elevates fully to the level of the &#x22;incomparable&#x22; Princess of Helium --
genuinely beautiful and strong of will and heart. Willem Dafoe as Tars
Tarkas and Samantha Morton as Sola; Mark Strong as the delicious
villain Matai Shang -- the cast is without exception strong. The
special effects are state o the art and seamless -- and the music by
Michael Giachinno deserves special mention: haunting, unique, and
uniquely suited to the material, and the editing by Eric Zumbrunnen
seamlessly supports the narrative.<br /><br />The &#x22;flaws&#x22; amount to quibbles: The film feels lean and compact at 2
hours and 12 minutes and feels as if it could benefit greatly from 10
additional minutes which could have been used profitably to better set
up the moment when John Carter and Dejah Thoris &#x22;close the deal&#x22; on
their love, and clarify some story points that are there -- but could
be highlighted more. Another beat of John Carter&#x27;s life among the
Tharks, implying a passage of time, would cause John Carter&#x27;s later
knowledge of the Tharks and their culture to make more sense (as it is
now he seems to pick it up in a matter of days and as audience we never
see where that knowledge comes from ). Another beat of John Carter
absorbing the new world he finds himself in, and implicitly comparing
it to what he left behind, would be welcome and would strengthen the
impact we would feel when he makes that choice. But these minor points
should not distract for the overall brilliance with which Stanton has
executed a challenging assignment.<br /><br />This is a film that bears watching more than once, and is complex and
nuanced enough that subsequent viewings will no doubt reveal new
treasures and clarify the minor rough edges -- yet it is also
compelling and moving on an immersive first viewing in the theater.
Perhaps the best indication of that is the fact that, in spite of my
supposed knowledge of and sensitivity to film structure -- I was taken
by surprise when it ended and was in no way ready for it to end. Could
the full two hours have gone by that fast? How? And as I sit here
writing about it the next morning, if there were an opportunity to go
back and see it again tonight, I would do so without hesitation and,
quibbles aside, that&#x27;s a simple but ultimately profound recommendation.<br /><br />A final thought: Like everyone, I&#x27;ve got plenty of things going on in
my life and my world, distracting things, things that makes me worry,
things that drag my mind out of a movie when I&#x27;m watching it and back
into my world. Not one little tiny bit of that intruded into this
movie. I was transported and when it was over I couldn&#x27;t believe that
was it -- I thought there was at least another 45 minutes owed to the
audience. On a visceral level, without trying to overthink it -- that
says a lot about what Andrew Stanton has accomplished, building on the
foundation of the grandmaster Edgar Rice Burroughs.
