2012_March 28 
Some things are better left alone. Last year, a classic literary novel,
&#x22;Atlas Shrugged&#x22; by Ayn Rand, was adapted into a film after several
decades of developmental chaos. And the results, as far as I am
concerned, were disastrous. That picture made my Ten-Worst list and
even though 2012 is not even halfway through, I&#x27;m sure another literary
adaptation that was also left on the developmental shelves for decades,
will show up on this year&#x27;s rendition. The picture is called &#x22;John
Carter&#x22; and is based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs story &#x22;A Princess of
Mars.&#x22; Not having read the book myself (yet!) I cannot compare the film
to it, but the picture surely could have been left unmade, as it is
also a disaster. More lavish than &#x22;Atlas Shrugged: Part One&#x22; but still
a disaster. One that bored and frustrated me from start to finish.<br /><br />The movie has an infuriatingly chaotic narrative from the beginning. We
start on Mars, with the two humanoid races of Mars in a furious midair
battle. The fight is interrupted by some blue-skinned beings claiming
to represent a Martian goddess, and bestow a terrific new weapon to the
leader of one side, allowing him to start winning the war. Cut to 19th
century America, where John Carter, an Army renegade, is unsuccessfully
being coerced back into the service to combat renegade Apaches. Or
something of the sort, since the movie barely scratches the surface of
this opening subplot. He escapes, gets into battle with some Apaches,
escapes into a cave, kills a blue-skinned being who appears out of
nowhere, and is whisked off to Mars. There he becomes a pet to a race
of four-armed green aliens. From there evolves a saga about a princess,
a wedding, a continuing war, a portal, a grave that can only be opened
from the inside, a boring love story, and so much chaos and confusion
that I was left to wonder if the writers even knew what they were
doing.<br /><br />The screenplay for &#x22;John Carter&#x22; was written by three people, two of
whose past work I have admired. One of them, Andrew Stanton, also
directed the film. In the past, Mr. Stanton has collaborated on some of
Pixar&#x27;s finest films (the &#x22;Toy Story&#x22; movies, &#x22;Finding Nemo&#x22;). This
picture may be the only fault to come out of that relationship. For Mr.
Stanton, who has worked on many films that were done using a computer,
seems far more interested here in what can be done with pixels than
what can be done with a story. Part of the reason why the screenplay is
such a muddled, bewildering mess is because the film is just too eager
to show off what computers can do. Frankly, for me at least, that is a
well that has long-since dried up. There&#x27;s a lot of images in &#x22;John
Carter&#x22; but not much imagination. None of the three races,
flesh-and-blood as well as computer-generated, have any distinguishable
personality. The green-skinned aliens also have steeds that look like
amphibian cows, and yet presents them with no sense of interest. Maybe
on Mars, they&#x27;re a common sight, but for somebody who just came from
Earth, surely they might at least generate a pause. The most
interesting figure is an alien dog that looks more like a toad, and can
run at supersonic speed. Make him the star, I say. The characters and
what they do have no real purpose except just to be there. For example,
one supporting character, a Martian princess comes up with a weapon
which might help them against the evil warlord. This subplot is cut at
the throat before it can be developed and never reconnects at any point
later in the story. It&#x27;s just dead air.<br /><br />The movie also lacks what the original story must have had lots of:
spectacle. There is no sense of awe or majesty about Mars or the living
things on it, again, because the movie is in such a hurry to jump from
one subplot to another while showing off its computer-generated imagery
like a test reel. The titular character, upon arriving on Mars, learns
that he can jump like a flea on this planet. Instead of going for
spectacle, the movie goes for cheap laughs with him falling on his face
in a montage consisting of several silly jump cuts, and then a lot of
ridiculous shots, where clearly the actor has been swapped with a
computer-generated double. Then I started wondering just how he wasn&#x27;t
breaking his ankles and how, when early on just a slight shove could
send him flying, later, when climbing a rock pile, a light jump does
not put him on his tiptoes.<br /><br />Acting is generally bad, but I won&#x27;t single anybody out, for most of
the cast has done fine work before. But how can you blame them when the
dialogue they are given is nothing but a succession of cornball lines?
For that is where this movie ultimately founders: in its screenplay.
Because the characters are so thin, the dialogue so bland, the sense of
respect for the original vision so low, when there are big
inter-species battles, and those blue-skinned beings shift-shaping in
the midst, I found no reason at all to care what happened or who came
out on top. &#x22;John Carter&#x22; would like to be a lighthearted
adventure-in-space epic with a visual punch, but it left me bored to
tears. And the visuals are not that punchy, for there was never a
moment where I did not realize I was looking at actors superimposed
against a computer screen.
