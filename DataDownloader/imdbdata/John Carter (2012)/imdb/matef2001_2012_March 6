I watched the movie today in a premier show<br /><br />There is a lot of unexplained stuff in the movie such when the princess
told him there is no river and then we suddenly found him reaching the
river, and when he jumped on the shifter aztral character to take his
medal back and the aztral disappear before carter reaches him and
suddenly we discovered that he got the medal ???!!!<br /><br />and some other unexplained act and scene <br /><br />also this movie is a 3D movie !!??, I didn&#x27;t feel the it is a 3D, the
3D effects is few and not that great compared to other 3D movies<br /><br />Can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t enjoy it, I certainly did but I expected more than
that and to come out of the movie saying Wow but this didn&#x27;t happen :(
am a little disappointed . .
