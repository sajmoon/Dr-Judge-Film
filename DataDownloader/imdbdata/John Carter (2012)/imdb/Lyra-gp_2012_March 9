I&#x27;ve just come back from tonight&#x27;s screening, but I already feel the
need to turn my excitement into words. Here is a list of the most
important points concerning the movie.<br /><br />I- Book VS Movie <br /><br />First of all, I&#x27;m quite sure you all know that the story behind John
Carter is from an Edgar Rice Burrough&#x27;s novel called &#x27;A Princess of
Mars&#x27;. Let&#x27;s be frank, this is one of the best novels ever written in
American literature: The precursor of the sci-fi genre, it is
remarkably well- written and ingeniously structured. Disney and Pixar
had to face, then, an hard task: turning one of the most beloved
American classics into a movie it&#x27;s not what we would define &#x27;easy&#x27;,
for sure. Especially if there are lots and lots of fans striving for a
good installment that does not spoil the general atmosphere of
Burrough&#x27;s masterpiece. In my opinion, Disney and Pixar successfully
managed to provide us with a modern adaptation of the book: funny,
moving and thrilling, perfectly reflects the spirit of &#x27;The Princess of
Mars&#x27;.<br /><br />II- Creating a planet <br /><br />One of the best features of the movie is undoubtedly its setting. The
hard work that Pixar put in the creation of the land where the story
takes place is highly recognizable: from the deserts to the buildings,
everything&#x27;s represented in every small detail (Will this be the reason
for a future Oscar prize?). Another thing that I particularly
appreciated is that even all the characters are splendidly recreated,
JUST LIKE Burroughs describes them in his book. The one I liked the
most is Woola.<br /><br />Furthermore, to your surprise, you&#x27;ll find out how amazingly the
Martian culture&#x27;s been reproduced. It was not easy to summarise in a
130 minutes lasting movie the thousands and thousands words that
Burroughs spends describing the society of Mars and all its
curiosities, but Disney and Pixar made it, with exceptional results.<br /><br />III- Actors on Mars <br /><br />In &#x27;John Carter&#x27;, many well-known actors set foot on Mars, and two of
them particularly caught my attention: Taylor Kitsch and Daryl Sabara.
Taylor Kitsch is perfect to play the role of a John Carter&#x27;s modern
version: He&#x27;s not the usual heartless muscled man that too often we see
in the movies. His face&#x27;s fascinating, his expressions and his gestures
are captivating. Actually I&#x27;m quite happy for this choice. Secondly,
there&#x27;s Daryl Sabara. He provides us with a tender interpretation of
Edgar Rice Burroughs, that i deeply enjoyed. I don&#x27;t know why but I
think that no other actor could have played the role of Burroughs
better than him. In fact, I loved the first part of the movie, totally
dedicated to the famous author. Moreover, a special mention goes to
Willem Dafoe, that plays the role of Tar Tarkas.<br /><br />IV- Music on Mars <br /><br />Or, in other words, ode to Michael Giacchino, who once again reveals to
be one of the best composers ever. If you want to hear my favorite
piece of music, you can find it as John Carter&#x27;s official website&#x27;s
background music (www.johncartermovie.com). I suggest to buy the
movie&#x27;s soundtrack on Amazon, something that I always do with the best
soundtracks I listen to. <br /><br />V- Mars in 3-D?<br /><br />This is probably the most annoying fact concerning the movie. The movie
is in Disney Digital 3-D but...is the 3-D a good reason to spend some
bucks more? In my opinion no, it&#x27;s not. Apart from three or four nice
&#x27;pop up effects&#x27;, during the projection you&#x27;ll easily forget that
you&#x27;re watching a movie in 3-D. The 3-D technology is not mature enough
yet: In all my life, I have never seen a movie (except, maybe, for
Avatar and Hugo) in a great 3-D. <br /><br />VI- Finally, what&#x27;s new in JC? <br /><br />Even though John Carter is from a three-centuries-old novel, it
represent a fascinating attempt to bring to life one of the most
captivating stories ever. Surely there are many sci-fi movies clich&#xE9;s
(that&#x27;s due to the period of time the novel the movie is based on was
written), but it doesn&#x27;t mean the movie is not highly enjoyable. You
will laugh, you will cry (actually it depends on your &#x27;sensibility
level&#x27;) and you will jump off your seat. What are you waiting for? Go
and watch the sci-fi movie of the year.
