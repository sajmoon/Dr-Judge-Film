I personally loved this movie. I&#x27;m not going into detail about what
this movie was about or the books. There have been plenty of people to
do that already. I will say this. I was very entertained. I felt like I
was in another world for a couple of hours. The entire film was
gorgeous. It was well acted. My fianc&#xE9; and I enjoyed it immensely. We
go to the movies every weekend and I would rate this in the top 3 we&#x27;ve
seen this year. If you want a good time, go see it. It&#x27;s definitely
worth it. Yes, Disney spent 250 million on this movie. You can tell how
much work went into it. I really hope it makes enough to do the
sequels. I&#x27;m definitely interested in seeing them all.
