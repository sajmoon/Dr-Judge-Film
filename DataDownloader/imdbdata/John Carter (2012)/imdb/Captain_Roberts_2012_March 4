We just saw a pre-release showing of this movie and I had to pick my
jaw up off the floor a few times. The movie is simply stunning. While
there may be small details to niggle at for the most die-hard Burroughs
fans, this is &#x22;inspired by&#x22; a Princess of Mars, it isn&#x27;t a straight
adaptation. The movie is a whirlwind of amazing visuals, powerful
dialog and soul-wrenching storytelling.<br /><br />I&#x27;d had high hopes that this movie would live up to the hype
surrounding it. It surpasses it, the hype doesn&#x27;t even come close. From
beginning to end, this movie focuses on story, and expands on a great
story with stunning effects as opposed to just using great FX in place
of solid storytelling.<br /><br />It also has one of the strongest pieces of non-verbal storytelling
outside of Up.<br /><br />Do not miss this film. Do see it in the theaters. Do see it in 3D.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed. I&#x27;m certainly chomping at the bit for
release day so I can see it again and I&#x27;m already hoping for a sequel
based on The Gods of Mars.
