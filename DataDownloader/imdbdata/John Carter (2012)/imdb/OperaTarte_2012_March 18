When you get to the point where Aliens begin to disappear &#x26; character
revelation takes over, then that is proof of a brilliantly conceived,
directed &#x26; acted story. It never feels self conscious but balances
everything as reality, something that other films in this genre, for
me, are lacking no matter how many awards are given.<br /><br />Nothing has been left lacking, it&#x27;s a terrifically satisfying &#x26;
entertaining experience. I&#x27;ve seen it twice already since opening day.
The production values are A+, but never detract from the story, they&#x27;re
just there as a part of it. The battle in which Carter makes the
decision to not repeat a previous loss heightens the quality &#x26; meaning
of the film. I&#x27;m looking forward to screening No. 3. And actually
enjoyed it much more in 2D rather than 3D.
