For those of you who do not know, John Carter of Mars first came to be
in the story Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote in 1912 called &#x22;A Princess of
Mars,&#x22; which is the inspiration of the sci-fi movies of James Cameron&#x27;s
Avatar, George Lucas&#x27; Star Wars and Flash Gordon, and countless others.
There are many things in this film that you can tie all those to, but
only because this is the ORIGINAL sci-fi adventure, and the best one.
John Carter, a civil war veteran, is accidentally transported to Mars
after a run-in with a Martian and must now help a princess stop two
warring civilizations from destroying each other and save the dying
planet.<br /><br />This film, in every possible way, is just absolutely incredible. It may
not be an original film, but it is, once again, the original story.
Taylor Kitsch is phenomenal as Carter, a man with a dark and sad past
who must choose whether or not to help these &#x22;alien&#x22; peoples. Lynn
Collins was absolutely stunning and beyond beautiful as Dejah Thoris, a
Red Martian of Helium. Willem Dafoe was incredible and believable as
Tars Tarkas, a Thark; an fifteen-foot tall, four-armed green Martian.
The setting was just amazing in the way that it truly takes you to a
different world; you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re watching a movie, but
you&#x27;re experiencing the real adventure. The music, by Michael
Giacchino, was a mixture of John Williams and Hans Zimmer; memorable
and epic. Andrew Stanton really knew what he was doing when he directed
this film, as it lives up to the name Burroughs hoped it would. Don&#x27;t
be swayed by the critics; this is a movie that NEEDS to be seen, and
look at it as if it were the original if you want the full experience.
The story always captivated me, as i read it when i was six, and to see
it on the big screen was beyond a dream-come-true. There truly has to
be a sequel, and i hope to God that it&#x27;s made; Thank You Andrew Stanton<br /><br />10/10 Stars***
