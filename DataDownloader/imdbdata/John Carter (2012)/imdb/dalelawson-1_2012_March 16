Elaborate special effects, a large budget and a week plot are often
three aspects that define a blockbuster movie. Everyone also always
expects them to be somewhat enjoyable and entertaining, whether you are
a film critic, movie-buff or just an occasional cinema goer. So when
John Carter (Dir. Andrew Stanton, 2012), the first blockbuster of the
year, was released; audiences expected an entertaining linear
narrative. What we weren&#x27;t expecting was a slow paced, overly
complicated sci- fi/fantasy film with mediocre acting and special
effects that really weren&#x27;t that special. <br /><br />John Carter follows, you guessed it, the character John Carter (Taylor
Kitsch) as he attempts to find a hidden cave of gold after fighting in
the American civil war. Through a series of events he is accidentally
transported to Mars where he befriends a tall, four-armed alien race
and a lost princess. Eventually he ends up fighting the various
factions of Mars in order to protect and marry Dejah Thoris (Lynn
Colins), the said princess. <br /><br />The budget should be addressed first after watching John Carter. It is
estimated to have a budget of $250,000,000 which seems an extortionate
amount considering even Avatar (Dir. James Cameron, 2009) had a lower
budget of $237,000,000, and John Carter&#x27;s special effects do not
compare to that of Avatar&#x27;s. Yes, John Carter does look nice, and it
does have some fantastic motion-capture animation, but it is definitely
not $250,000,000 worth of effects. <br /><br />The ability of all the actors in John Carter varies from excellent to
unfortunately terrible. Willem Dafoe is one of the excellent few, along
with Mark Strong, as he provides an emotionally attaching and
believable tribal alien leader, Tars Tarkas. The films protagonist,
John Carter, and his love interest, Dejah Thoris, are both reasonably
performed by Kitsch and Colins. Unfortunately Dominic West, who plays
the faction leader trying to conquer Mars, was terrible. He was handed
a bland, one- dimensional character by the script writers and therefore
was unable to develop the character to any success. <br /><br />After bad mouthing the film for almost the whole of the review it is
about time I say something good about it. There is one scene in
particular worth mentioning. John Carter engages, about half way
through the film, in combat with hundreds of a rival alien race. During
this fight scene it cuts between Carter battling on Mars, and his wife
and child back on Earth. This scene is the most heartfelt in the whole
film, and it almost seems worthwhile watching the film just for this
one scene. <br /><br />John Carter is a standard blockbuster movie with action, explosions and
special effects. However it won&#x27;t appeal to the masses due to its
obscure sci-fi/fantasy genre mix with swords and solar powered planes
on Mars battling Avatar-esc aliens. This film has flopped on its
opening weekend, and I can not see it making its money back. I also
cannot see there being a sequel filling the Pirates of the Caribbean
void; as much as the director, actors and Disney would have hoped. <br /><br />http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/
