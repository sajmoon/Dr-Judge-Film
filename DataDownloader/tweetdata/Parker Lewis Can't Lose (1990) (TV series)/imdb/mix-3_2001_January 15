I love it. I do. This, IMHO, is what a teenage/youth comedy should be. A
perfect example of how a series can be intriguing, funny and yet explore
the
very real situations high school students come face to face with every
day.
And it does this without being crude, without offensive language etc.
Having
seen the series, some of the other similar series like Sweet valley high,
Saved by the bell and, yes, Ferris Bueller (TV series) look like pale
imitations and wannabes.
Granted, Parker isn't for everyone. The surreal situations may alienate or
simply bother some viewers. But it depends on the person.<br /><br />Give it a try.
