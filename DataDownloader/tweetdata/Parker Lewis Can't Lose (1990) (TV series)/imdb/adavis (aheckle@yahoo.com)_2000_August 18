This show premiered the same year as Ferris Beauler on NBC. It is a total
injustice that this show ran for three years and Ferris Beauler only ran
for
one. Despite low ratings Fox would not cancel this show. One time it went
off the air for a few months and Fox really promoted its return. A lot of
good it did the show continued for where it left off at the bottom of the
ratings
