Somebody happened to say &quot;coolness&quot; to me yesterday who was wearing this
obnoxious shirt, and it made me instantly remember this show. I religiously
watched this show in college. The first season is nothing short of pure
genius. Absolutely helarious with irreverant characters, whacky plots, and
some camera work that rivals the Cohen brothers in Raising Arizona.<br /><br />Every now and then you can catch somebody on Ebay selling off the entire
show on VHS. If you get a chance to see an episode, don't miss it. Its
genuinely funny stuff.<br /><br />However, beware the 3rd season. The show's popularity seemed to cause it
troubles with the Studio Execs so they retooled the show in the 3rd season
and killed off a lot of its charm. Most of the 3rd season episodes are
booooooring standard sit-com fair.
