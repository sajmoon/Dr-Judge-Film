&quot;Parker Lewis&quot; was a very unusual show, and that's probably also the reason
why it only lasted 3 seasons. The show revolves around the life of the main
character Parker (the trendy guy), and his pals, Mikey (the cool guy), Jerry
(the nerdy guy) and later on also Kubiac (the bully guy, who turned out to
be all right).<br /><br />It's all about being a teenager, and all what comes with it, love, trouble
with the parents, making choices etc. What makes the show unique is the
stories, and more importantly how they are told. It's hard to explain
really, but it's something out of the ordinary, and it definately worth
checking out. <br /><br />Even though the show didn't last very long, it did help make the way for
other brilliant children/young adult shows such as &quot;Eerie Indiana&quot; and &quot;The
Adventures of Pete and Pete&quot;.
