Like its contemporary on Nickelodean, &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;, Fox's
early hit &quot;Parker Lewis Can't Lose&quot; was a show featuring a teenage
protagonist sporting an attitude of mastery of one's environment. However,
hidden in within the plot lines was a hint of the insecurity that all teens
face.<br /><br />The stories follow Parker Lewis(Corin Nemec) and his two friends, the suave
Mikey and the nerdy Jerry. They do battle with a cold-hearted principal and
Parker's spiteful younger sister, while somehow navigating the strange
worlds of high school.<br /><br />This amusing show was one of Fox's staples during its earlier years, and
went into brief syndication. Look for fan favorite Abraham Benrubi(Jerry on
&quot;ER&quot;) as the recurring character of Kubiac, a hulking, basically
non-speaking giant of a high school student.
