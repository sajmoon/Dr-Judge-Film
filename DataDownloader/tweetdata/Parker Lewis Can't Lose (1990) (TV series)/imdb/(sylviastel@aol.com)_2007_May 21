I still can&#39;t believe that I haven&#39;t seen this show since it&#39;s
cancellation. Corin Nemec was known for his role as Steven Stayner in a
made for television film about the Stayner abduction and life. Corin
displays his acting ability here to show his range can be comedy. The
show only lasted a couple of seasons on Fox when it was innovative,
new, and fresh. Now, I crave for shows like Parker Lewis Can&#39;t Lose to
return again to television. His supporting cast wasn&#39;t forgettable
neither but it was lightened side of adolescent life. Too bad, it
hasn&#39;t come out on DVD. I bet it would be a hit all over again. I
remember that it didn&#39;t have a studio audience which I thought was
different from a sitcom standard.
